00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.200
<i>The Führer's promises of peace and
prosperity have fallen by the wayside...</i>

2
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.500
<i>leaving in their wake a path of destruction.</i>

3
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.300
<i>The outrages committed by Hitler's SS are
a stain on the honor of the German Army.</i>

4
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.600
<i>There is widespread disgust
in the officer corps...</i>

5
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.600
<i>toward the crimes committed
by the Nazis...</i>

6
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.300
<i>the murder of civilians...</i>

7
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.800
<i>the torture and starvation of prisoners...</i>

8
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.400
<i>... the mass execution of Jews.</i>

9
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.800
<i>My duty as an officer is no longer
to save my country,</i>

10
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
<i>but to save human lives.</i>

11
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.600
<i>I cannot find one general
in a position to confront Hitler</i>

12
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.900
<i>with the courage to do it.</i>

13
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.000
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
The General will be here in four hours.

14
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.200
Thank you.
I'll need to see him when he arrives.

15
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.500
<i>I find myself surrounded by men
unwilling or unable to face the truth.</i>

16
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.700
<i>Hitler is not only
the archenemy of the entire world</i>

17
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.000
<i>but the archenemy of Germany.</i>

18
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.500
<i>A change must be made.</i>

19
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.000
Colonel, my orders are to advance
to Sidi Mansour and hold it.

20
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.100
That's what we'll do.

21
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.100
The British are moving up from the south,
Patton is closing in on the coast.

22
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.500
You know,
we should have left two days ago.

23
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.300
No, Colonel.

24
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.500
We keep fighting until the final victory.

25
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.100
North Africa's lost, and you're going to
need these men a year from now

26
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.800
to defend Berlin.

27
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.600
We can serve Germany or the Führer,
not both.

28
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.400
It's just that sort of talk
that had you sent here, Colonel.

29
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.600
What I said was much worse.

30
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.000
General.

31
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.700
I'm just trying
to get these men out of here alive.

32
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.000
- What would you have me do?
- Tell Command we're low on water.

33
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.300
We'd have to reroute to Mezzouna,
join the 21st Panzer.

34
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.800
At least then we'd have a chance.

35
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.100
And the records will show that we didn't
have enough water to reach Sidi Mansour

36
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.900
I can guarantee it.

37
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.800
See that it's done.

38
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.700
General.

39
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.600
Up!

40
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.700
Down!

41
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.300
- Hitler's leaving.
- Now?

42
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.600
<i>Ja. Fuse.</i>

43
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.900
Colonel Brandt! Colonel Brandt!

44
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:30.500
My regards to Colonel Stieff.

45
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.300
Cointreau?
Let's hope I don't get thirsty on the flight.

46
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.900
This is Tresckow.

47
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.600
He's landed.

48
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.200
This is General Tresckow.

49
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.200
Connect me with Operations,
Colonel Brandt.

50
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.100
Colonel! Tresckow.

51
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.600
I'm glad you arrived safely.
I hate to trouble you,

52
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.400
but it seems you have the wrong bottles
for Colonel Stieff.

53
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.300
You do still have the package?

54
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.600
Oh, no, no, no. As it happens,
I've been called to Berlin unexpectedly.

55
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.900
I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up.

56
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.400
Sorry for the inconvenience, Colonel.
Yes, thank you.

57
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.000
Do you think he knows?

58
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.900
Well, there's only one way to find out.

59
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.100
- We've been discovered.
- What makes you think that?

60
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.800
Oster's been arrested.
The Gestapo came for him last night.

61
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.000
The Gestapo could have arrested him
for anything.

62
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.400
- What do you think went wrong?
- We don't know.

63
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.900
Fuse. Temperature. Altitude.
All I know is the damn thing didn't go off.

64
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.300
- General Tresckow to see Colonel Brandt.
- The Colonel's expecting you, sir.

65
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.900
At ease.

66
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.900
You'll forgive me, General.

67
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.400
This little roundup
has had me writing reports all day.

68
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.800
- Roundup?
- Dissenters.

69
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.200
- Another plot against the Führer.
- Who are these people?

70
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.400
You'd be surprised.

71
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.700
Now, is this what you've come for?

72
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.900
Perhaps we should open it.

73
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.800
I beg your pardon?

74
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.300
Well, you've come a long way.
You must be thirsty.

75
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.100
You know, I wonder how the Führer,
who does not partake,

76
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.500
would feel about a soldier
who did so on duty.

77
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.800
Colonel Brandt.

78
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.200
I took you for another sort, General.

79
00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.400
And I you.

80
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.500
We're still in business.

81
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.100
Find a replacement for Oster.

82
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.700
There's no one we can trust, not in Berlin.

83
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.300
Well, then stop looking in Berlin.

84
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.700
Countess von Stauffenberg?

85
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.300
Perhaps before you go in, we could have
a word together in my office.

86
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.400
I will see my husband now.

87
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.500
The right hand has been amputated
above the wrist.

88
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.200
He's missing the fourth and fifth fingers
on the left hand.

89
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.600
We couldn't save the left eye.

90
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:34.600
Colonel.

91
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.900
When you're ready, sir.

92
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.400
<i>I'm a soldier. I serve my country.</i>

93
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.600
<i>But this is not my country.</i>

94
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.500
<i>I was lying out there bleeding to death,
thinking, "If I die now,</i>

95
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.500
<i>"I leave nothing to my children
but shame."</i>

96
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.700
I know now there's only one way
to serve Germany.

97
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.100
In doing so, I'll be a traitor.
I accept that.

98
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.700
Just tell me,
can these men see it through?

99
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.400
We need to reorganize.
Reconsider our strategy, recruit new men.

100
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800
That's why we want you.

101
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.600
You understand what will happen
to my wife and children

102
00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.200
if these men can't see it through?

103
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.300
Come and hear what they have to say.

104
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.300
You know where to find us.

105
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.700
Enough! Enough. I'm not going to listen
to another word of this.

106
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:05.000
You had your chance, you failed.

107
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.700
Your so-called "central solution"
didn't work.

108
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.700
Our only option now
is to confront Hitler openly.

109
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.900
This is a military operation...

110
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.500
It's not a military operation,
it's a political organization,

111
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.900
and one that's given its military arm
too much control.

112
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.100
In any military exercise,

113
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.000
you have to expect
a certain measure of deviation.

114
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.800
A measure? A measure?
What about total, complete, utter failure?

115
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.100
Gentlemen, I think it's time
we face the fact

116
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.700
that the Allies are coming,
sooner or later.

117
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.300
I say we sit back
and let them wipe out the Nazis.

118
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.600
And ask every living soul in Europe
to pay the price? Use your head.

119
00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.700
- Carl, please.
- I'm sorry, Ludwig.

120
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.300
I've held my tongue too long.

121
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.000
We must confront Hitler now.
Force him out!

122
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.600
And then what?

123
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.900
I beg your pardon?

124
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.800
When Hitler is gone, then what?

125
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.500
I'm sorry, who is this man?

126
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.600
Colonel Stauffenberg
is Oster's replacement.

127
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.100
He's been transferred to my office
at the War Ministry.

128
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.500
- How's your uncle?
- He's well, sir. He sends his regards.

129
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.000
- He speaks very highly of you.
- And of you, General.

130
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.500
Of course, one of the things
that made Oster such a great organizer

131
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.400
was that he kept his opinions to himself.

132
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.600
I'm simply asking what you intend to do
when Hitler is gone.

133
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.700
You don't really believe you could just
walk into the Reich Chancellery

134
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.000
and command the army to end the war?

135
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.600
Yes. We do.

136
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.600
You are in the presence of men
who would have been Hitler's inner circle.

137
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.100
Instead, we refused, Colonel.

138
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.700
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

139
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.200
We have the respect of the people.
And the army.

140
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.400
Then you don't need me. Gentlemen.

141
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.800
<i>Those men are confusing
respect with popularity.</i>

142
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:07.000
The army swore an oath,
an oath that won't just die with Hitler.

143
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.200
What are you going to do?

144
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.700
How are you going to deal with Goebbels?
Himmler? The SS?

145
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.700
- They will wipe you out!
- It doesn't matter!

146
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.700
It only matters that we act, now,
before we lose the war.

147
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.000
Otherwise, this will always be
Hitler's Germany.

148
00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.800
And we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him.

149
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.500
That is not enough for me.

150
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.400
There has to be a chance of success.

151
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.500
Then find a way.

152
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.300
<i>- Poppy!
- Poppy!</i>

153
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.300
- Poppy's home! Poppy's home!
- Poppy's here! Poppy's here!

154
00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.500
Mommy, he's here!

155
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.300
- Mom, come down!
- Poppy's here!

156
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.000
I thought we agreed
I'd come see you in Bamberg.

157
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.200
- The children couldn't wait.
- The children?

158
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.600
Super!

159
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.600
<i>Valkyrie.</i>

160
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.100
We've already considered Valkyrie.
It isn't suitable.

161
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.300
Not as it's currently written,
but the Colonel has an idea

162
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.000
- I think we should consider.
- Excuse me. What is Valkyrie?

163
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.600
Operation Valkyrie.

164
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.000
The Reserve Army has thousands of men
all over Berlin.

165
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.600
Valkyrie is Hitler's contingency plan

166
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.200
to mobilize those men
during a national emergency.

167
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.800
The sole purpose of the order
is to protect Hitler's government

168
00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.000
- if he's cut off or killed.
- And what use is this to us?

169
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.700
Valkyrie is designed
to contain civil unrest.

170
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.500
But what if the SS were staging a coup?

171
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.600
State Security is trying
to overthrow Hitler.

172
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.900
- How would High Command respond?
- We would have no choice.

173
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.700
We would declare
a military state of emergency.

174
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.400
Exactly, and initiate Valkyrie.

175
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.400
Hitler's own Reserve Army,
using Hitler's own plan,

176
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.100
will have no choice but to seize power
in Berlin to prevent the SS takeover.

177
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.900
They'll think they're fighting
for Hitler's government, not against it.

178
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.300
While we quietly put
a new government in place.

179
00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.600
But only if he's dead.

180
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.500
That's what you're saying, isn't it?

181
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.100
How else are you going to convince people
the SS are trying to seize power?

182
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.100
We have to kill Hitler.

183
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.500
I'm disappointed in you, Colonel.
I thought a man of your background

184
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.500
would suggest
a more honorable approach.

185
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.200
Your plan has a few
minor obstacles, Colonel.

186
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.700
Firstly, Valkyrie would have
to be rewritten to exclude the SS.

187
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.500
Then I'll need your help to get a copy.

188
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.800
Rewriting an order is one thing.

189
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.500
Distributing it is another.

190
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.900
In this case,

191
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.600
we'd be willfully circulating
written evidence of high treason.

192
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.300
Evidence requiring Hitler's signature.

193
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.900
Well, we can all draw straws for that job.

194
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.100
- And what about Fromm?
- Fromm? Who is Fromm?

195
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.800
He's the commander of the Reserve Army.

196
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.500
I can put the reserve troops on alert,
but only Fromm can initiate Valkyrie.

197
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.600
Can you get to him?

198
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.000
We're running out of time.
Can you get to Fromm?

199
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.300
He's a careerist pig.

200
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.000
But one who's gone as far as he can go
in Hitler's army.

201
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.100
It's no secret he's not happy about it.

202
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.100
Offer him a key position
in the new regime.

203
00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.700
Make him see the light.

204
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.200
Your office is through there.

205
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.200
I have Colonel Stauffenberg
for General Fromm.

206
00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.200
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
Welcome back to the War Ministry.

207
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.500
- It's an honor, sir.
- You're an old woman, Fromm!

208
00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.800
I'd send you to the front

209
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.900
if I didn't think you'd surrender
just to be Montgomery's whore!

210
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.500
The General will see you now.

211
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.900
What is it you want?

212
00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.000
I wanted to introduce our new man,
Colonel Stauffenberg.

213
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.100
From Africa.

214
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.500
I... I'd offer you my hand,
but I might not get it back.

215
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.100
I'd say the General has lost
more important things this morning.

216
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.600
It's about time they put somebody
with balls into this office.

217
00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.400
Please, sit down, Colonel.
And you, Olbricht, if you must.

218
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.700
They tell me you're critical
of the war, Colonel,

219
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.300
not that you don't seem
to have good reason.

220
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.400
I am critical of indecision, General.

221
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.400
- In the field?
- In Berlin.

222
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.900
So that's why you're here, I take it, to...

223
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
- To make decisions.
- I've already made my decision.

224
00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.600
I'm here to help others make theirs.

225
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.900
They say when there's no clear option,

226
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.800
- the best thing is to do nothing.
- We're at war. We must act.

227
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.800
Sometimes rashly.

228
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.300
And what rash action
did you have in mind, Colonel?

229
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.700
That would be a decision
for the supreme military commander, sir.

230
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.300
A supreme commander.

231
00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.600
Second only to the Chancellor.

232
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.000
If I were that man,

233
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.200
this war would be going quite differently.

234
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.300
Well, we were thinking the same thing.

235
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
I don't need to remind you

236
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.400
that we've all sworn an oath

237
00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.500
to the Führer.

238
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.300
Having said that, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place,

239
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.800
in the strict understanding

240
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.700
that such talk never occurs again
under this roof.

241
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.400
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

242
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.000
Now, you can tell your friends, Colonel,
that I always come down on the right side.

243
00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.900
And as long as the Führer is alive,
you know what side that is.

244
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.500
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

245
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.600
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

246
00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.500
Of course! Yes! Very good guess!

247
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.200
You realize how close I am to Hitler.

248
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.000
With one word I can make you disappear.

249
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.680
My associates don't know we've been talking,
if that's what you're afraid of.

250
00:30:56.700 --> 00:31:00.300
When the SS catch you,
they will pull you apart like warm bread.

251
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.400
It will be a crime
just to have known you then.

252
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.900
I warn you, don't try to contact me again.

253
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.500
You won't report me.

254
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.100
Maybe if you had
when I first approached you,

255
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.600
you might have been keeping your oath.

256
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.100
Now you're just as guilty as the rest of us.

257
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.500
And you think that makes me
a sympathizer, hey?

258
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.200
Give a man a choice of betraying
his fellow officer or his Führer

259
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.800
and you think his actions
will show you his heart.

260
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.800
- It is not that simple.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

261
00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.600
For the last time,
don't push me to make a decision.

262
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.400
I don't have a choice. It's clear now.

263
00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.100
Without you, there is no hope of success.

264
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.200
You're nothing but rats
jumping from a sinking ship!

265
00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:43.700
What makes you think
you'll be any different?

266
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.300
What makes you think you're stronger
than the people, the Reich?

267
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.300
- The very momentum of history!
- This is going to happen.

268
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.800
Action is inevitable,
as are the consequences.

269
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.400
When they come for me,
I'll do everything I can

270
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.100
to hide what you knew
and when you knew it,

271
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.900
but don't delude yourself.

272
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
You were involved in a crime
against your country

273
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.000
long before you met me.

274
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.100
There may still be time
to redeem yourself.

275
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.700
Only God can judge us now.

276
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.700
Hitler had Operation Valkyrie designed

277
00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:24.500
to completely secure his government
in six hours.

278
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.200
I'm rewriting the order so we can seize
control of the government in three.

279
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:31.000
As written,
the order spreads reserve troops

280
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.500
across all of Germany's
19 military districts,

281
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.600
including occupied cities
like Paris, Vienna and Prague.

282
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.400
<i>This is a waste of resources.</i>

283
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.300
<i>Since all of these districts follow
orders from Berlin without question,</i>

284
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.800
<i>you take Berlin, you take Germany.</i>

285
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.900
I'm rewriting Valkyrie

286
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.600
to direct the majority
of our strongest units

287
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.800
to focus entirely on Berlin.

288
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.600
We'll surround the government quarter,
occupy all SS and police barracks.

289
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:02.100
Once we have control of the government,
we'll shut down all concentration camps.

290
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.900
Any officers who resist
will be arrested or shot.

291
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.500
I've been transferred to the front.

292
00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.300
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

293
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.200
You know these orders
better than anyone.

294
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.900
That's why I'm putting you in charge
of the military wing of the operation.

295
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.300
- Beck agrees.
- Why not Olbricht?

296
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.400
No. It's your plan. It's you.

297
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.600
One more thing.
You need to be absolutely certain

298
00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.700
no conflicting orders get out
after the flash.

299
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.300
It is not enough to kill Hitler.

300
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.200
We need to isolate his chain of command

301
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:36.800
and cut them off
from the outside world immediately.

302
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:41.600
Yes, I've already considered that.
I think I have just the man who can help.

303
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.500
- Who is he?
- Perhaps it's better I don't say.

304
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.000
You know, God promised Abraham
he would not destroy Sodom

305
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.400
if he could find just 10 righteous men.

306
00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.200
I have a feeling that, for Germany,
it may come down to one.

307
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.200
Let's begin.

308
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.000
"The Führer, Adolf Hitler,

309
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.300
"is dead."

310
00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.200
<i>Heil Hitler, General.</i>

311
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.600
Would you excuse us, please? Thank you.

312
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.000
You play the part
of bureaucrat beautifully.

313
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.600
It's the only time I get to relax.

314
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.300
You've been promoted
Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army.

315
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.500
- Excuse me?
- Congratulations.

316
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.700
- I am busy with other things.
- Unfortunately,

317
00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.300
your nocturnal activities
don't count as service to the Reich.

318
00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.700
- I'll refuse the promotion.
- You'll do no such thing.

319
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.400
Tresckow may have left you
in charge of the operation,

320
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.400
but in this world I still outrank you.

321
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.900
You will accept the promotion.

322
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:15.000
You'll have real access to Hitler,
his advisers, his schedule. We need this.

323
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.800
I've looked through your changes
to Valkyrie.

324
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.600
I approve.
I'll need you to get Hitler to sign it.

325
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.400
Now. There's a man here to interview
as your adjutant.

326
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:34.700
He comes highly recommended.

327
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.000
Close the door.

328
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.700
Be seated.

329
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.500
Do you know
how this war will end, Lieutenant?

330
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:58.500
The portrait will be unhung,

331
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.800
and the man will be hung.

332
00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.500
I'm engaged in high treason
with all means available to me.

333
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.300
Can I count you in?

334
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.800
For anything, sir. Anything at all.

335
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.400
Come. Come, come.

336
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.900
Colonel Brandt, Operations.

337
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Colonel Stauffenberg, I'd like to review
your presentation to the Führer.

338
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.100
Strictly routine.

339
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.700
Sir, the contents of the Colonel's bag
are for the Führer's eyes only.

340
00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:47.800
I am the Führer's eyes, Lieutenant.

341
00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.900
The Colonel is a member of my staff
at the War Ministry.

342
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
He doesn't answer to you.

343
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.500
- They're waiting.
- This way.

344
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.900
My Führer.
May I present Colonel Stauffenberg,

345
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.350
<i>our new chief of staff
for the Reserve Army.347</i>

346
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.300
<i>Heil, my Führer.</i>

347
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:50.200
May I say what an honor it is
to meet an officer

348
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.900
who has sacrificed so much for Germany.

349
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.900
If only more of my men were like you.

350
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:08.000
Let this man stand
as an example to all of you.

351
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.800
He is the ideal German officer.

352
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.100
My Führer. Colonel Stauffenberg
was asked to come here today

353
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.200
to brief us on mobilizing troops
of the Reserve Army to...

354
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:23.200
To repel the invasion.

355
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.100
Invasion?

356
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.100
At Normandy, my Führer.

357
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.400
Oh, yes.

358
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.500
Normandy.

359
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.800
That will not be necessary.

360
00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:45.900
<i>Reichsmarschall Göring assures me that
everything is completely under control.</i>

361
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.400
Thank you, Colonel.

362
00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.600
My Führer, if I may.

363
00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:00.600
I have an amended copy
of Operation Valkyrie for your approval.

364
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.200
You know your Wagner, Colonel?

365
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:05.100
The Valkyrie. Handmaidens of the Gods,

366
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.200
choosing who will live and who will die,
sparing the most heroic

367
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.100
from an agonizing death.

368
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.500
One cannot understand National Socialism

369
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.800
if one does not understand Wagner.

370
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.800
I'm sure whatever changes you've made
are for the best.

371
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.100
You're dismissed. Send your man home.
And, Fromm?

372
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.800
ave some fresh tea brought in, will you?

373
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.100
I don't know what you're brewing up,
and I don't want to know.

374
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.000
But when the music stops,

375
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.500
I'd be obliged if Keitel found himself
without a chair.

376
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.100
Any problem on Earth can be solved

377
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.500
with the careful application
of high explosives.

378
00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.900
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

379
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.500
Two 975-gram packs of Plastit W.
Enough explosive to cripple a panzer.

380
00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:51.200
Your detonators, your fuses.
British time pencils.

381
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.400
This acid capsule is your trigger.
When you're ready to arm,

382
00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:00.300
attach the detonator to the bottom
of the time pencil, like so,

383
00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.200
insert the entire device
into either end of the Plastit W,

384
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.400
crush the acid capsule, and you're live.

385
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:14.700
When the acid eats through the wire
holding back the firing pin,

386
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.400
well, you'll want to be very far away.

387
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.900
For you.

388
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.500
- How much time will we have?
- Theoretically there's a 30-minute delay,

389
00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.000
but with the kind of heat
you can expect at the Wolf's Lair,

390
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.200
I'd give you 10, 15 minutes, tops.

391
00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.200
That's hardly precise.

392
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.800
This is state-of-the-art.
You can have small or precise, not both.

393
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.000
Might this just be a little too small?

394
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.500
No. Hitler's bunker will magnify the blast.

395
00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.500
It is constructed of reinforced concrete.
Steel door, no windows.

396
00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:48.900
The air pressure generated by just one
of these explosives in a space like that

397
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.800
will kill everyone instantly.

398
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.100
The second charge
will be entirely redundant.

399
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.000
If, by some miracle,
Hitler does survive, what then?

400
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.400
We still initiate Valkyrie.

401
00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.900
At that point,
there will be no turning back.

402
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.100
But we'll have an advantage.

403
00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.900
We have an inside man at the Wolf's Lair.

404
00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.800
After the flash, he'll cut off communication
with the outside world.

405
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.200
While Hitler's inner circle
is struggling to regroup,

406
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.000
we'll have the momentum we need
to seize control in Berlin.

407
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.300
Himmler is expected to be
at the meeting as well.

408
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.200
Don't proceed
unless you can get them both.

409
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.800
What?

410
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.400
Don't proceed unless you're confident
you can get both Himmler and Hitler.

411
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.800
This is Goerdeler, isn't it?

412
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.600
I'll hold off, if the decision is unanimous,

413
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.600
but I want another man on the committee.
Not a politician.

414
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.000
- Who?
- Him.

415
00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.900
- Him?
- Him.

416
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:56.000
Fine.

417
00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:03.000
But remember, this is a military operation.
Nothing ever goes according to plan.

418
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.100
I'll take the children to Bamberg.

419
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:44.600
If I fail,

420
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.000
they'll come for you.

421
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.200
All of you.

422
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.300
I know.

423
00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:27.000
Gentlemen. Good morning.

424
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:31.000
Hitler has scheduled a military briefing
for today at 1:00.

425
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.600
Stauffenberg will start
once everyone is present.

426
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.400
<i>- They're here.
- Before arming the explosives,</i>

427
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.400
<i>Stauffenberg will call
for authorization to proceed.</i>

428
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:44.300
<i>After the flash, his inside man
will sever all communications.</i>

429
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.900
<i>Assuming Fromm refuses to join us,</i>

430
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.200
<i>Olbricht would take command
of the Reserve Army</i>

431
00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:51.200
<i>- and initiate Valkyrie.
- Initiate Valkyrie.</i>

432
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.600
<i>Then he'll notify all district commanders
that the SS is attempting to seize power.</i>

433
00:46:55.700 --> 00:47:00.100
<i>The Reserve Army will arrest all SS,
Gestapo and Nazi officials.</i>

434
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.400
<i>By then, Stauffenberg
will have returned to Berlin</i>

435
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.900
<i>and taken command of the Reserve Army.</i>

436
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.600
<i>Witzleben and I will assume the roles
of commander of the armed forces</i>

437
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.200
<i>and head of state.</i>

438
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.500
<i>With Berlin secured,</i>

439
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.600
<i>Dr. Goerdeler will address the nation
as our new chancellor.</i>

440
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.500
Then, God willing,

441
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:22.500
we can negotiate a truce with the Allies
and save Europe from total destruction.

442
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.700
This will identify you
as a member of the operation.

443
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.100
Nobody gets in or out of the perimeter
without one.

444
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.700
Gentlemen, this is the most important day
of your lives.

445
00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.900
Long live sacred Germany.

446
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.000
- Captain.
- What is it?

447
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.700
An order from General Olbricht's office.

448
00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:25.300
It's calling the Reserve Army
for some sort of standby action

449
00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.000
in all the military districts,
including Berlin.

450
00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.900
Looks like a drill of some kind.
Send it through, Sergeant.

451
00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.200
Sir?

452
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:03.700
- "Standby action"? What the hell for?
- The order doesn't say.

453
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.800
Assemble the men.
This better not be a drill.

454
00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:54.100
The men are assembled
and awaiting further orders.

455
00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.100
What do you suppose
this is really all about?

456
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.400
Your man?

457
00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.100
He is now.

458
00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.900
Colonel.

459
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.500
Attention!

460
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.000
Gentlemen. For our first order of business,

461
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:25.700
General Fromm will present his plans

462
00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:29.500
for the reallocation of troops from
the Reserve Army on the eastern front.

463
00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.600
Now, as you know, last night
the Russians launched a new offensive

464
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.700
against Army Group North Ukraine
in the South Poland section.

465
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.900
General Harpe was brought in
to replace Model

466
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.700
and bring a swift end to this confrontation.

467
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.500
- Himmler is not here.
- Hence the transfer of three divisions

468
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.200
to fortify General Harpe's troops.

469
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:55.400
Now, these divisions will stick
to a mobile defense plan

470
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.800
rather than holding any one particular...

471
00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.100
Yes, sir. I'll put that right through.
Connecting now.

472
00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.200
<i>- Operator.
- Direct me to the War Ministry.</i>

473
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.900
<i>- General Olbricht's office.
- One moment, please.</i>

474
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Yes, sir. Connecting now.

475
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:18.200
- General Olbricht's office.
- Himmler's not in the briefing.

476
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.900
I'm ready to arm. Permission to proceed.

477
00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.900
Hold the line.

478
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.900
Stauffenberg says Himmler's not
at the briefing. He wants to proceed.

479
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.300
Call Beck.

480
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:32.800
<i>- Beck.
- Himmler is not at the briefing.</i>

481
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.500
Himmler's not at the briefing.

482
00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.800
...already diminished reserves.

483
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.800
<i>No.</i>

484
00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.100
They say no.

485
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.200
What do you say?

486
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.500
I say do it.

487
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.700
Attention!

488
00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.300
Whatever it was, Colonel,
I hope it was important.

489
00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.200
Colonel? Your bag.

490
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.300
This has been a drill! You're dismissed!

491
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.700
How dare you put the Reserve Army
on standby without my knowledge?

492
00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.400
Damn near cost me my commission.

493
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.100
And what in God's name made you think
you even had the authority?

494
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:39.500
- It was only a drill, an exercise.
- Don't lie, Olbricht! Not to me.

495
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.600
We both know it wasn't a drill.

496
00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.200
- General, if I may...
- No, you may not, Colonel.

497
00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.900
You may not do anything.

498
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.100
Because not only have you proved to me
you can't deliver,

499
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.800
you've painted a target on my back.

500
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:54.900
If I so much as sense you trying
to move the Reserve Army again,

501
00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.800
I will personally have you both arrested.

502
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.900
Do I make myself abundantly clear?

503
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.800
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.200
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

505
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.600
I'll hear you say it, Colonel.

506
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.200
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

507
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.300
The point of replacing Hitler
is to negotiate a truce with the Allies.

508
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.800
The Allies, I suspect,
would be more amenable to a truce

509
00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:45.900
if we offer it to them
before they get to fucking Berlin!

510
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.400
There's no point in killing Hitler
unless you kill Himmler, too.

511
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:52.000
Why remove a madman
just to have a lunatic take his place?

512
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.800
Today's failure had nothing to do
with Himmler, and you know it.

513
00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:58.600
This is a military operation
in the hands of a politician, nothing more.

514
00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:00.900
- What are you suggesting?
- I'm not suggesting anything.

515
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I'm stating the facts as I see them.

516
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.100
You don't have the courage to kill Hitler,
so you are making the task impossible.

517
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.300
Nothing seemed to stop you and your
henchman from trying it on your own.

518
01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.600
My only regret is that I waited for you
to find your backbone.

519
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.700
I don't think I'm alone
when I say your judgment is in question.

520
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.700
- I'd like to call a vote.
- Carl.

521
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.100
I propose
that we relieve Colonel Stauffenberg.

522
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.400
Carl, can I have a word with you
in private?

523
01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.400
No, Ludwig.
If you've got something to say, say it.

524
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.900
Very well. I heard from the Chief of Police
this evening

525
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:34.200
that Himmler has issued a warrant
for your arrest.

526
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.500
You have to leave Germany tonight.

527
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.600
When we succeed
with the central solution,

528
01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.200
you'll return as chancellor.

529
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.000
Disappear, Carl.
Avoid contact with anyone.

530
01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.000
Good luck, Colonel.

531
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.700
No more indecision.

532
01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:17.300
From now on,
Stauffenberg has full discretion.

533
01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.600
I can't issue the alert again
unless we follow through.

534
01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.900
I'll do my job. You just take Berlin.

535
01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:34.000
<i>Hold on, sir.
I'll try to connect you right now.</i>

536
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.500
Thank you.

537
01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.100
<i>- Hello?
- Hello?</i>

538
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.800
Hello?

539
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.000
Hello?

540
01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.900
<i>I'm sorry, sir. There is bombing in Ebingen.
We've been disconnected.</i>

541
01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:54.900
<i>Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg.
I'm sure your family is safe.</i>

542
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.400
Thank you.

543
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.900
Welcome, Colonel.

544
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.100
Do you have a place
where I could change, Major?

545
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.500
Please follow me.

546
01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.800
At least put the Reserve Army
on standby alert.

547
01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.900
Not until I've heard from Stauffenberg.
Not until I'm sure.

548
01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:57.400
- But that's not what he...
- Noted, Colonel. Thank you.

549
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.900
The meeting has been moved up to 12:30.

550
01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.900
Mussolini is arriving
on the afternoon train.

551
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.300
- The Führer wants to have lunch with him.
- Yes, sir.

552
01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.700
Will Mussolini be joining us
in the briefing, sir?

553
01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.200
I only wish he were.

554
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.900
The some ambitious officer
might take the opportunity

555
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.100
to shoot that dago bastard.

556
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.700
Excuse me, General.
I'm expecting an important call.

557
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.000
Could you please have someone come
and get me?

558
01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.800
Even if I'm with the Führer.

559
01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:39.400
- Of course, Colonel.
- Thank you, sir.

560
01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.000
Colonel.

561
01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.300
Major Freyend speaking.

562
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.500
Colonel? They insist you hurry.
The briefing's about to begin.

563
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
One moment, please, Major.

564
01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.000
Ten minutes.
Two for the walk, one for the checkpoint,

565
01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:46.500
one for the bunker, six to get out.

566
01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:48.700
Plenty of time.

567
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.500
Excuse me, Colonel.

568
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.500
Sir! The Führer's at the briefing!

569
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.800
The Colonel is changing, Major.

570
01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.600
- You understand this can be difficult.
- Of course.

571
01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.200
Plenty of time.

572
01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:58.900
- Get the car.
- But, sir...

573
01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.600
I have everything I need. Get the car.

574
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.300
I can manage this.

575
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:47.200
- Where are they going?
- It's too hot.

576
01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:50.500
The briefing has been moved
to the conference hut.

577
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.500
Major, my injuries
have left me hard of hearing.

578
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.200
Would you place me
as close to the Führer as possible?

579
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.199
- I'll see what I can do.
- ...against the Red Army.

580
01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.400
Not only have they been advancing
from the east,

581
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.900
but they're coming down on the northern
and the southern fronts as well.

582
01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:34.900
As you can see, my Führer,
if the enemy continues at this rate,

583
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.400
the situation in the East Prussian sector
is critical.

584
01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.700
Lack of supplies is continuing
to weaken our main units,

585
01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800
and reserves are severely depleted.

586
01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.900
My Führer,
you remember Colonel Stauffenberg?

587
01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.400
As you are all aware,

588
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.400
in the past two days alone,
the 10th Army has given up Ancona,

589
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.500
the 14th Division has been pushed
out of Livorno.

590
01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.300
Army Group Center has already lost
28 of their 40 divisions.

591
01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:12.300
That is a total of almost 350,000 men.

592
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.400
Since the Red Army first attacked
nearly a month ago,

593
01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.800
our troops have already been pushed back
to the Polish border.

594
01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.700
Conference hut.

595
01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:31.400
This, compounded with the loss
of the 4th Army in Minsk,

596
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.400
- threatens the entire eastern perimeter.
- Yes, sir.

597
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.900
We must consider pulling men
from Army Group North Ukraine,

598
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.600
as well as the Romanian...

599
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.300
...and prevent further losses.

600
01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.300
Unless we can quickly dispatch
new blocking divisions

601
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.500
at vital points along the German right,

602
01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.899
- Army Group will be swallowed by the enemies...
- Colonel. There's a telephone call for you.

603
01:09:56.899 --> 01:09:58.100
.....in less than a fortnight.

604
01:09:58.100 --> 01:10:01.900
And we run the risk of losing
all the ground we have managed to gain

605
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.900
in the last three years. Our spearhead...

606
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.900
General Fellgiebel, sir.
He says it's urgent.

607
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.900
Yes, General, this is Stauffenberg.

608
01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:22.600
...Russian air activity has proven just
as impregnable as their ground force.

609
01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.800
- Why?
- My Führer...

610
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.900
In some areas
they outnumber us seven to one.

611
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:40.300
If we can afford to give ground
along the Italian front, I further...

612
01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.600
One thing is certain,

613
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:49.400
the Red Army will continue
an aggressive push west,

614
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.500
even at the expense...

615
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.700
In order to rebuild at this...

616
01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:08.800
...already southwest of Düneburg
and closing on Army Group at Lake Peipus.

617
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.400
If they are not immediately withdrawn,
it will be a catastrophe.

618
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.700
Get in. Drive.

619
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.200
I have orders from the Führer. Drive.

620
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.200
Drive! Drive!

621
01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:51.100
As you were.

622
01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:26.000
Get me the War Ministry.
General Olbricht. Olbricht!

623
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:27.900
The call is urgent!

624
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.500
General Olbricht's office.

625
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.200
I'm calling from the Wolf's Lair

626
01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.000
with an urgent message
for General Olbricht.

627
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Something terrible has happened.
The Führer is...

628
01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.700
Fellgiebel?

629
01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:48.900
Sever all communications.

630
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.600
- Sir?
- Just do it!

631
01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:57.800
- Well, what did he say?
- I couldn't be sure.

632
01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:01.300
Well, get him back on the line.

633
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.900
Sir, the bomb did go off.
That much was clear.

634
01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:09.000
Fellgiebel's next step will be
to sever all communications.

635
01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.800
- Sorry, Colonel. No one gets in or out.
- We have an order from the Führer.

636
01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.100
We have to get to the airfield immediately.
Open the gate.

637
01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.900
I'm very sorry Sir,
but my orders are to keep the gate...

638
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.900
- I just gave you an order, Sergeant.
- Sir!

639
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:33.100
Sir. Excuse me.

640
01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.800
Colonel Stauffenberg
for Field Marshal Keitel.

641
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:53.200
Colonel Stauffenberg was expicit.
We initiate Valkyrie regardless.

642
01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.900
Only Fromm can initiate. You know that.

643
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.900
Then tell him Hitler's dead.
Or arrest him. But do it now.

644
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.900
Sir, you have to give the order
to initiate Valkyrie. This is our only...

645
01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:04.000
I'm not doing anything
until I hear from Fellgiebel.

646
01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.400
Get him back on the phone now.

647
01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.800
Every second we stand here arguing
is a second lost.

648
01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.300
The risk is too great.

649
01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.300
What about Stauffenberg?
What about his risk?

650
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.700
He did his part,
and now you're abandoning him.

651
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.300
Field Marshal, sir. Stauffenberg here.
A Sergeant...

652
01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.600
Kolbe, sir.

653
01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:22.400
- What?
- Kolbe.

654
01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.000
...Kolbe won't let me pass the main gate.

655
01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:27.100
Yes, sir, I explained that.

656
01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.900
Perhaps you can
make him understand, sir.

657
01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:37.900
Everything's fine now, sir. Thank you.

658
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.800
Open the gate!

659
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.800
- At least put the Reserve Army on alert.
- When Stauffenberg returns,

660
01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:59.200
when he gives me confirmation
that Hitler is dead, then we'll proceed.

661
01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.600
- And where are you going?
- The same place as you are. Lunch.

662
01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.700
Another standby alert.

663
01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.200
Send it through. But keep me informed.

664
01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:26.100
Sir. Another standby order.

665
01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.700
In ancient Greece,
you would have been killed for this.

666
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.000
Lucky for you we've evolved.

667
01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:41.000
Assemble the men.

668
01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.800
Quiet, isn't it?

669
01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.300
I'll see where our driver is.

670
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.200
This is von Haeften.
The Colonel and I are at the airfield.

671
01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.800
There's no car. There's no one here.

672
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.300
You mean to tell me
the alert's only just gone out?

673
01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.800
This is Stauffenberg.
Get me General Olbricht.

674
01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.900
What's this?

675
01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.400
- Explain this!
- Someone had to do something

676
01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:10.500
while you were playing dead!

677
01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600
We don't know that Hitler is not alive.

678
01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:14.800
This is about Germany, for God's sake,
not you!

679
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.700
General Olbricht's office.
Colonel Stauffenberg. For you, sir.

680
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:39.100
- This is Olbricht.
- It's been three hours, Olbricht.

681
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.400
What the hell have you been doing?

682
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:42.800
We've had no confirmation
that Hitler was dead.

683
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.400
Damn it! I saw the explosion myself!
We are committed.

684
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:53.100
- Dear God.
- Now, where is Fromm? Is he with us?

685
01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.700
- Is he with us?
- No one has spoken to him yet.

686
01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:12.900
You listen to me. Never mind Germany.
Never mind Europe.

687
01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.200
Your life is at stake now.

688
01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.700
And if you want to live through the night,
you'll do exactly as I say.

689
01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.900
The second you hang up the phone,
initiate Valkyrie in Fromm's name.

690
01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.900
Give him the choice to join us,
or place him under immediate arrest.

691
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.900
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

692
01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.900
I'll be in Fromm's office in 15 minutes.
Be there when I arrive.

693
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Call Beck and the others.
Tell them it's time.

694
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.100
Put me through to Communications.

695
01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.600
This is General Olbricht,

696
01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:18.900
calling on behalf of General Fromm,
commander of the Reserve Army.

697
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.300
The Führer, Adolf Hitler, is dead.

698
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.900
A group of radicals in the SS

699
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.400
are attempting to seize control
of the government.

700
01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.700
Initiate Operation Valkyrie.

701
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.100
You have your orders. Pass them along.

702
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.500
Battalion. Attention!

703
01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.600
The Führer...

704
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.700
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler,

705
01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:04.600
is dead.

706
01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:09.900
- Who told you the Führer was dead?
- General Fellgiebel. At the Wolf's Lair.

707
01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.100
There's no use calling.
All communication lines are down.

708
01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.300
- Yes. Get me the Wolf's Lair.
- One moment, sir.

709
01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.800
Wolf's Lair. May I connect you?

710
01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:27.200
Yes. General Fromm
for Field Marshal Keitel. Urgent.

711
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:34.600
- Keitel.
- Yes, I'm sorry to disturb you, sir,

712
01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:36.400
but I wonder if you could tell me
what's happening.

713
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.200
The most incredible rumors
are circulating in Berlin.

714
01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.800
I don't know what you mean.

715
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:44.200
There's talk
that the Führer has been assassinated.

716
01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.800
<i>Another failed attempt.</i>

717
01:23:48.100 --> 01:23:50.600
The Führer was never in danger.

718
01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:54.000
By the way,
where's your man Stauffenberg?

719
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:58.700
Stauffenberg? He...
On his way back to Berlin, I would think.

720
01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.700
Let me know when he arrives.
I'd like a word with him.

721
01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:13.500
- The Führer's fine.
- That is a lie. Adolf Hitler's dead.

722
01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:17.200
- Operation Valkyrie is in effect.
- Only I can initiate Valkyrie.

723
01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:18.500
You did.

724
01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:28.800
This is treason.

725
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:31.700
Right now, the Reserve Army's
assuming control of Berlin.

726
01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.500
Are you with us or not?

727
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.200
Do you realize what you've done?

728
01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.300
- The Führer is alive.
- I deliver the bomb myself.

729
01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.600
I saw the blast. He is dead.

730
01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.900
- Are you with us?
- I don't believe this is happening.

731
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.300
- This is some kind of a joke.
- Are you with us or not?

732
01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.700
Colonel, if what you say is true,
you should shoot yourself immediately.

733
01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.300
- The rest of you are under arrest.
- No, General. You are.

734
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.800
I don't know where you think this is going.

735
01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:11.400
Get me Operations.

736
01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:14.100
This is Colonel Stauffenberg.

737
01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:16.600
Seal off the War Ministry
per Operation Valkyrie.

738
01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.700
No one gets in or out

739
01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.300
without authorization
from General Olbricht's office.

740
01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:42.500
General Beck.
You're not wearing your uniform, sir.

741
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.700
This should be seen
as a movement of the people.

742
01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.600
- Colonel Stauffenberg?
- Yes.

743
01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:03.200
The chief has guaranteed
the full support of the Berlin Police.

744
01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.900
You will have no interference
from my men. You have my word.

745
01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.700
Thank you.

746
01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.900
Colonel Stauffenberg, sir.
We are reporting for duty.

747
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.400
Thank you for coming.

748
01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.800
Gentlemen, in three hours
I want confirmation

749
01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.700
that the government quarter is ours

750
01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:14.100
and SS Command has been cleared
of every living soul.

751
01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.100
You all know what must be done.

752
01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:20.400
By nightfall, I want to know
that Hitler's Germany

753
01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.300
has seen its last sunrise.

754
01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.000
Yes, sir.
All replacements have been authorized.

755
01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:57.500
In fact, Field Marshal Witzleben

756
01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.500
has been appointed Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces.

757
01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:02.000
That's exactly why he's been appointed.

758
01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.600
If he was a member of the Party,
he'd be locked up as a suspect.

759
01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.900
Yes, sir, I understand your concern,
but this is an emergency.

760
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.700
The commanding officer
at the 11th District, please.

761
01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.800
I need a decision, Major.

762
01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.900
Tell your men that acts of vengeance
will not be tolerated.

763
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.700
Why hasn't anyone occupied
the Tegel broadcasting station?

764
01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.500
Can I speak to the commanding officer
in Hannover, please?

765
01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.800
We represent
a different form of government.

766
01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:18.300
I'd be careful who you said that to.

767
01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.900
Loyalty to the Party
isn't what it used to be.

768
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.800
- Yes, Paris. France.
- Not since they murdered the Führer.

769
01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.400
And, Josef. Thank you.

770
01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:25.900
You've made the right decision.

771
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
District 13 is ours.

772
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.100
By order of Field Marshal von Witzleben,

773
01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:46.400
you are under arrest
for crimes against the state.

774
01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:57.500
This is Stauffenberg. I'm trying to
connect with Major-General Thadden.

775
01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.000
No, I've already spoken to 413 Battalion.

776
01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.700
You'll have no trouble getting
reinforcements. Yes, Sir

777
01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.700
This is Colonel Stauffenberg. The order
explaining everything will be in your hand shortly.

778
01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:05.400
No, these are your orders. Excellent.

779
01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.000
My wife is in Bamberg with my children.

780
01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:11.500
Would you please try to raise them
on the phone?

781
01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.600
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

782
01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:15.600
General Schwedler
has issued the Valkyrie orders

783
01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:16.700
and has sealed off headquarters.

784
01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:18.700
Good. Check on the radio stations
every 20 minutes

785
01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:21.000
till we have confirmation they're ours.

786
01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.100
Well, with all due respect, sir,
you can't believe everything you hear.

787
01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.000
That is SS propaganda. He's dead.

788
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:42.100
Only the commander of the Home Army
is authorized to give orders.

789
01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.400
General? Sir.

790
01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.200
- Hello, Christian?
- Our men in the transport offices

791
01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:48.800
have secured
the railway communications network,

792
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:49.900
but there are repeater stations...

793
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.900
- Yes. I give you my word.
...telephone and telegraph offices,

794
01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.100
emergency broadcast outposts.
We need more men.

795
01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.700
Thank you. Give my best to your family.

796
01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.200
He's with us.

797
01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.300
Mertz? Call Potsdam.

798
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.900
Tell them to place all available units
under our control.

799
01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:04.700
You have your men.
Now get control of the radio.

800
01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:06.700
We have control
of the government quarter.

801
01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.800
We don't have Berlin yet.

802
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.900
- What is it now, Sergeant?
- Arrest orders, sir.

803
01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.900
One from Colonel Stauffenberg
in the War Ministry

804
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.600
to arrest Reich Minister Goebbels.

805
01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:43.800
The other is from the Wolf's Lair,
to arrest Colonel Stauffenberg.

806
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.400
Send them both through.

807
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:57.400
Our job is not to interpret orders,
our job is to pass them along, regardless.

808
01:30:57.500 --> 01:31:00.200
- Yes, but...
- That will be all, Sergeant.

809
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:24.100
This is treason! You're all going
to pay for this! Do you hear me?

810
01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.200
New arrest orders, sir.
For Stauffenberg and Goebbels.

811
01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:44.700
Do we arrest them both?

812
01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.200
I would hate to find out
I'm being taken advantage of.

813
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:51.900
- You really think it's a coup?
- Of that I am certain.

814
01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:55.500
What I can't say is which side we're on.

815
01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.900
Come with me.

816
01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.900
District 4, Dresden and Leipzig.
District 12, Wiesbaden. District 9...

817
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.600
They've had no trouble
getting reinforcements,

818
01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:05.700
and I rely on you seeing
that this gets done.

819
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.400
I've just spoken to Colonel Linstow.

820
01:32:10.500 --> 01:32:14.500
They've arrested 1,200 SS
and Gestapo officials in Paris.

821
01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.100
Not a single shot fired.

822
01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:20.300
Early reports from Vienna are good.
I'm waiting on word from Prague.

823
01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.800
Incredible.

824
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.800
I'm ready to be connected.

825
01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:15.400
- Minister Goebbels?
- What can I do for you, Major?

826
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:18.600
My battalion has an order
to blockade the government quarter

827
01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.800
and place you under arrest.

828
01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.100
Are you
a dedicated National Socialist, Major?

829
01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.700
Yes, sir.

830
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.800
Major Remer here. Hello?

831
01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:52.900
Do you recognize my voice?

832
01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.800
- Yes, my Führer.
- Then listen to me very carefully.

833
01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.000
I want these traitors taken alive.

834
01:34:06.300 --> 01:34:07.800
Yes, my Führer.

835
01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:16.600
You heard what he said.
The Führer wants the traitors taken alive.

836
01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:20.200
Yes, sir.

837
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:50.200
It's a coup, all right. We can't afford
to remain neutral any longer.

838
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.600
You have to make a decision.

839
01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.700
When it's over,
we better wind up on the right side.

840
01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.600
Very well.

841
01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.400
Send through all communications
from the Wolf's Lair.

842
01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:17.200
Stop all communications
from Stauffenberg.

843
01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.000
Release these men!

844
01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.700
But they're part of the coup.

845
01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:31.200
I've just been on the phone
with Hitler himself.

846
01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:34.300
We are the coup, you idiot.
We've been duped.

847
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.000
We've lost contact with District 11.

848
01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:47.300
The switchboard is overloaded.
Give it 10 minutes and try again.

849
01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.500
Give me General Bieler, District 11.

850
01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:56.000
We still need...

851
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.800
- I don't want to leave any section...
- Keep trying.

852
01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:01.600
Out of my way. Where is General Fromm?

853
01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:08.200
General Fromm is no longer in command.
I am.

854
01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:10.900
Beck? What are you doing here?
What is going on?

855
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.100
The Führer is dead.
The SS are staging a coup.

856
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.800
We've initiated Operation Valkyrie
to crush the uprising

857
01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:18.400
and save Hitler's Germany.

858
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.800
You will present the order to your troops.

859
01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:25.100
I will do no such thing
until I speak to General Fromm.

860
01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:28.500
You will follow your orders,
or you are under arrest.

861
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:35.600
This is treason. I will take no part.
The Führer is not dead.

862
01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.400
- The Führer is not dead!
- Stop him!

863
01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:42.000
Führer is not dead!
The Führer is not dead!

864
01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:45.600
I have sworn an oath! This is treason!

865
01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.800
You all swore an oath!
Listen to what I have to say.

866
01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:52.400
You are all making a terrible mistake!

867
01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.400
The Führer is not dead!

868
01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.700
The Führer is not dead!

869
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.700
Please try my wife again.

870
01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.300
Bamberg, please.

871
01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:22.700
Take your hands off me!

872
01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:29.700
Sir.

873
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.600
Over 215 enemy tanks
have been annihilated

874
01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:45.600
in the past week alone.

875
01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.300
The air force,
engaged in low-flying offensives

876
01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.800
- on enemy concentrations...
- Lieutenant.

877
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:52.000
I can't get through to General Gerlach.

878
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:55.300
Send a runner down to his office.
Bring him here.

879
01:37:58.300 --> 01:37:59.800
Yes, thank you.

880
01:38:01.100 --> 01:38:02.300
Yes, this is Stauffenberg.

881
01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.800
I was speaking to the General
about five minutes ago.

882
01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.700
He told me he'd return my call.
I've yet to hear from him.

883
01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:10.300
I trust everything in your district
is under control?

884
01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:14.600
Hans, I need your answer.
There's no more time for indecision.

885
01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.300
And the General knows I'm waiting?

886
01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:18.800
I'm ordering you to put him
on the phone immediately.

887
01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:20.700
The army gave their oath to a liar, Hans.

888
01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:23.400
- Hello?
- One who's broken his own oath...

889
01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.900
- Hello?
...to the people a hundred times over.

890
01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.800
Hans, listen to me...

891
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.300
This operation has been terminated!
Stand down!

892
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:06.300
Today, an attempt
was made on the Führer's life.

893
01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:10.800
The Führer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises.

894
01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:13.300
He resumed his work immediately.

895
01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:15.900
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

896
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.900
Colonel Brandt and staff assistant Berger.

897
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.400
Lighter injuries were sustained
by General Jodl

898
01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.600
and Generals Korten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

899
01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.000
Send the following orders
to all Reserve Army commanders.

900
01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.000
"Broadcast incorrect. Führer is dead.

901
01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.400
"Operan Valkyrie still in effect."

902
01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.500
...and, as scheduled, received Mussolini
for an afternoon briefing.

903
01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:44.300
Long live our Führer, Adolf Hitler,

904
01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:47.600
whom the almighty God
has so visibly blessed today.

905
01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:53.100
I saw the blast.

906
01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.500
I saw the blast.

907
01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:12.000
Today an attempt was made
on the Führer's life.

908
01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:16.600
The Führer himself suffered no major
injuries beyond light burns and bruises.

909
01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:19.700
- I'm sorry.
- He resumed his work immediately.

910
01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:22.500
Those seriously wounded
include General Schmundt,

911
01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.100
Colonel Brandt and staff assistant Berger.

912
01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:29.300
Lighter injuries were sustained
by General Jodl

913
01:40:29.300 --> 01:40:32.900
and Generalorten, Buhle,
Bodenschatz, Heusinger...

914
01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.100
Shortly after the attempt on his life,

915
01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.700
the Führer was joined
by Reichsmarschall Göring

916
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.400
and, as scheduled, received Mussolini
for an afternoon briefing.

917
01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.100
Stay tuned for the Führer's address
to the German people.

918
01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:52.500
My family?

919
01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:55.900
Our lines have been cut.

920
01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:03.100
- I'm sorry.
- Go.

921
01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.700
It's all right. Go.

922
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.799
General. Sir.
We have to get you out of here.

923
01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.200
Get him out of here.

924
01:42:55.300 --> 01:42:57.000
- Stop!
- Stand down!

925
01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.400
- I said stop!
- I said stand down!

926
01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.500
Hold your fire!

927
01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:39.500
Colonel Stauffenberg?

928
01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:45.900
By orders of the Führer,
you're under arrest.

929
01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.100
If you have any last messages
to your wives and children,

930
01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.000
I will hear them now.

931
01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.400
Very well.

932
01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:19.600
A court-martial convened by me
in the Führer's absence

933
01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:22.700
will pronounce sentence.
Beck, you're under arrest.

934
01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:28.100
Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim,
General Olbricht, Lieutenant Haeften,

935
01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.400
and the Colonel
whose name I will not mention,

936
01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:31.900
are condemned to death.

937
01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.400
General. My orders are
to take these men alive.

938
01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:36.000
Noted, Major.

939
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.700
I'd like a pistol, please.

940
01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:44.300
For personal reason

941
01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.100
Get on with it.

942
01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:06.400
- With all respect...
- That will be all, Major.

943
01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.800
Killing us won't hide your involvement.

944
01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:12.100
My involvement?
I don't know what you're talking about.

945
01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:15.000
- You knew and did nothing.
- You're as guilty as any of us.

946
01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:18.900
- Spare me, Lieutenant.
- No one will be spared.

947
01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.900
I'm thinking of earlier times.

948
01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:46.500
This is an outrage that has never before
been perpetrated here!

949
01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:51.600
A field marshal and a general declare
that they could do things better

950
01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:54.400
than he who is the Führer of us all!

951
01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:58.100
- You confess to having said this?
- Yes.

952
01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.800
My fellow Germans.
I speak to you tonight for two reasons.

953
01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:13.100
First, so that you can hear my voice
and know that I am unhurt.

954
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.100
Second, so that you may know
the details of a crime

955
01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.900
without parallel in German history.

956
01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.600
A small clique of ambitious,
dishonorable officers

957
01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.900
have conspired to eliminate me.

958
01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:35.000
Except for a few bruises and burns,
I was completely untouched.

959
01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.300
I see in this the hand of Providence,

960
01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:43.100
directing me to complete my work.

961
01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.600
Look them in the eye.

962
01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:58.900
They'll remember you.

963
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.400
Olbricht!

964
01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:12.200
Make ready.

965
01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:31.700
Well, we have to show the world
that not all of us were like him.

966
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.100
Safe! Stand!

967
01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:44.300
Fire!

968
01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:47.000
Stand!

969
01:48:08.300 --> 01:48:09.800
Stauffenberg!

970
01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.300
The people know we put our principles
above personal gain.

971
01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:18.700
Make ready!

972
01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.600
Aim!

973
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Safe! Stand!

974
01:48:48.500 --> 01:48:51.900
You may hand us over to the executioner,

975
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.600
but in three months' time,

976
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.600
the disgusted and harried people
will bring you to book

977
01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.700
and drag you alive
through the dirt in the streets.

978
01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.600
Take him away.

979
01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:11.400
Make ready.

980
01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.900
Aim.

981
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.500
- Long live sacred Germany!
- Fire!

982
01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.400
Stand.
