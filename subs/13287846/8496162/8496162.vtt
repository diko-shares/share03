1
00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.139
Get back, you lot.

2
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.825
Get to the guillotine.

3
00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.268
The scourge of France!

4
00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:18.341
Terror is nothing
more than justice.

5
00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.512
Prompt, severe, inflexible.

6
00:04:22.638 --> 00:04:27.351
It is therefore an
emanation of virtue.

7
00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:32.523
Now, she was guilty of
three charges against you:

8
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.984
depletion of the
national treasury,

9
00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:41.740
conspiracy against the internal
and external security of state,

10
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:48.205
and high treason for acting
in the interests of the enemy.

11
00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.669
Mercy for the villains?

12
00:04:56.213 --> 00:04:57.214
No.

13
00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:00.843
Mercy for the innocent.

14
00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:03.637
Mercy for the unfortunate.

15
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.431
Mercy for humanity.

16
00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:14.523
An inescapable outcome
of democracy's connection

17
00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:18.819
in relation to the nation's
immediate demands at this moment…

18
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.405
The British navy have
taken the port of Toulon.

19
00:05:21.905 --> 00:05:24.241
Half the French fleet
is trapped there.

20
00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:27.619
If we lose those ships,
the Republic will fall.

21
00:05:28.704 --> 00:05:32.124
Lucky for us, there are only
2,000 English troops in Toulon.

22
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But we are short of artillery and led
by a general who was a court painter.

23
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.010
It is not necessary to
recapture Toulon itself.

24
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:47.222
The town is not a town.
The town is a port.

25
00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.809
If the harbor's untenable
to the English fleet,

26
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:52.102
the town must surrender.

27
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:56.398
My brother, Captain Bonaparte,
as artillery officer,

28
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.611
has organized heated shots
against English ships.

29
00:06:01.195 --> 00:06:04.072
He has proven his
commitment to the Republic.

30
00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.451
And how do you propose
to take the harbor?

31
00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:10.746
Capture the fort that
dominates the harbor,

32
00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:12.789
and you have the city.

33
00:06:18.003 --> 00:06:21.924
We must make an example,
or other cities will fall.

34
00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:25.260
And I, for one,

35
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:29.431
will never let the royalists
or the English take my region.

36
00:06:42.444 --> 00:06:43.445
Morning, sir.

37
00:06:44.988 --> 00:06:45.989
General Carteaux?

38
00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:48.408
He's over there.

39
00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:58.502
Lucien, my dear brother,
I am in Toulon already.

40
00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:05.592
The troops are in a poor state, and your
conscripts untrained and undisciplined.

41
00:07:06.343 --> 00:07:10.013
Without equipment and
resources, I see only failure.

42
00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:29.241
We are collecting scrap iron to recast
small mortars more suitable for my plan.

43
00:07:30.117 --> 00:07:31.577
If we do not succeed,

44
00:07:32.286 --> 00:07:37.082
those in power will only see us as
Corsican ruffians unfit for higher office,

45
00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:39.668
and our mother's
ambitions will be quashed.

46
00:07:52.264 --> 00:07:55.350
That's it, madam.
Fine eye you have.

47
00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:58.604
- There you go.
- I'll still be here next week.

48
00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:06.236
The British control the big guns that
point out at their fleet offshore.

49
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:11.575
Take those guns, and we can fire
onto them and end this blockade.

50
00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.926
Surprise is my advantage,
but I will win by fire.

51
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:31.595
I cannot wait for your arrival.

52
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.014
Your brother, Napoleon.

53
00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:38.559
Oi, shit rag! Yes, you!

54
00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:46.026
Move along now. Go on. Move!

55
00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:50.864
Move them fucking goats!

56
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:55.452
Last chance! Fucking
move them goats!

57
00:08:58.705 --> 00:09:00.749
You better fucking
move them now!

58
00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:03.210
Do you understand?

59
00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:22.688
He sat himself down
by the fire, my boys

60
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:25.732
To join in our jovial crew

61
00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:28.902
- Get in position.
- Quick!

62
00:09:28.986 --> 00:09:33.156
By the chimney corner
was his own place

63
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.743
Where he could sit
and dye his old face

64
00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:39.037
When Jones's ale
was new, my boys

65
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.539
Quick, quick!

66
00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:44.251
When Jones's ale was new

67
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:50.334
Pints of beer and bottles of sherry
To help them over the hill so merry

68
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:55.053
When Jones's ale was new

69
00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:47.564
Fire!

70
00:10:50.692 --> 00:10:52.361
We're under attack!

71
00:10:55.656 --> 00:10:58.784
We're under attack!
Grab your weapons!

72
00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:03.205
Get those ladders up quick, men!

73
00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:18.720
Fire! Hit your target!

74
00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.975
Get the mortars up there!

75
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:34.194
Ready, boy?

76
00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:39.032
Oh, God!

77
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.751
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

78
00:12:37.132 --> 00:12:38.717
Get the mortars!

79
00:12:48.352 --> 00:12:50.187
Protect the cannons!

80
00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:54.650
Into position!

81
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.116
- Vive la France!
- Vive la France!

82
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.346
Ready the cannons!

83
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:25.931
Sir! Yes, sir.

84
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:27.891
Mortars!

85
00:13:28.475 --> 00:13:31.520
Elevation 160.

86
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.025
- Fire!
- Firing!

87
00:13:40.195 --> 00:13:42.406
Junot, heated shots!

88
00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.324
Fire!

89
00:13:58.005 --> 00:13:59.882
Junot, fire!

90
00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:01.383
Fire!

91
00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:18.609
- Reload!
- Reload.

92
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:24.239
Fire!

93
00:14:24.323 --> 00:14:26.617
Fire!

94
00:14:42.424 --> 00:14:44.843
Shoulder, hold!

95
00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:50.641
Captain Napoleon Bonaparte, I award
you the rank of brigadier general.

96
00:14:54.645 --> 00:14:55.854
Long live the Republic!

97
00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:58.273
Long live the Republic!

98
00:14:58.357 --> 00:15:01.985
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

99
00:15:06.573 --> 00:15:10.661
I promised you brilliant
successes, and I've kept my word.

100
00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:21.004
Order, hold!

101
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.159
For Mother.

102
00:15:57.124 --> 00:16:00.210
The current leadership of France
has passed from enthusiasm

103
00:16:00.294 --> 00:16:01.628
to reckless ambition.

104
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:07.259
And the public perception of the
guillotine is lawless passion,

105
00:16:07.926 --> 00:16:09.636
led by Robespierre.

106
00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:12.222
He is unfit to rule.

107
00:16:19.771 --> 00:16:20.772
Bonaparte.

108
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.151
France!

109
00:16:24.651 --> 00:16:28.363
It has become increasingly
clear, Citizen Robespierre,

110
00:16:28.447 --> 00:16:33.118
that your motivations are to use
this blade to your ultimate power!

111
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:36.079
Let me speak!

112
00:16:37.706 --> 00:16:41.543
There is no man in this room
who has objected to my methods.

113
00:16:41.627 --> 00:16:46.048
If you say I am guilty,
you are all guilty!

114
00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.010
You are not a
defender of freedom.

115
00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:56.093
You have deemed yourself judge,
jury and executioner, have you not?

116
00:16:56.683 --> 00:16:59.770
You're worse than Caesar!
Worse than Caesar!

117
00:16:59.853 --> 00:17:03.065
You are, all of
you, the traitors!

118
00:17:03.148 --> 00:17:04.650
Arrest him!

119
00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:22.209
Get him.

120
00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:49.027
You missed.

121
00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.699
The guillotine, my friend.

122
00:20:24.725 --> 00:20:26.393
A seven, madame.

123
00:20:30.063 --> 00:20:31.190
Deal again.

124
00:20:42.075 --> 00:20:43.076
Deal again.

125
00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:51.627
Your bet.

126
00:21:02.596 --> 00:21:03.597
Seven again.

127
00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.101
No. No win.

128
00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:13.148
I'll be out first. That's mine.

129
00:21:23.158 --> 00:21:24.535
Why are you staring at me?

130
00:21:25.869 --> 00:21:26.870
Am I?

131
00:21:28.247 --> 00:21:29.331
- No, I was not.
- Yes.

132
00:21:30.332 --> 00:21:31.333
You weren't?

133
00:21:32.417 --> 00:21:33.418
I was.

134
00:21:34.878 --> 00:21:37.464
I was staring at your face.

135
00:21:38.924 --> 00:21:40.843
What is this
costume you have on?

136
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:42.928
This is my uniform.

137
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.765
I led the French
victory at Toulon.

138
00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:55.315
Do not tell me your name.

139
00:22:14.126 --> 00:22:15.127
General?

140
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:19.006
There is a very young man
who wishes to see you.

141
00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:21.800
His name is Eugène Beauharnais.

142
00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:32.019
Citizen.

143
00:22:40.569 --> 00:22:41.904
General Bonaparte.

144
00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:43.488
Yes?

145
00:22:43.572 --> 00:22:47.743
My name is Eugène Beauharnais,
son of Joséphine Beauharnais.

146
00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:49.494
What do you want?

147
00:22:50.621 --> 00:22:52.039
My father's saber.

148
00:22:52.664 --> 00:22:57.085
It was taken from him before
he was arrested and executed.

149
00:22:58.086 --> 00:22:59.338
Yes?

150
00:22:59.421 --> 00:23:03.675
It would mean a great deal to me and
to my mother if it were returned to us.

151
00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:05.636
It's all we have of him.

152
00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:07.179
The sword is a weapon.

153
00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:11.808
I cannot allow citizens to have
weapons in their possession.

154
00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:15.979
The sword is a keepsake for me
to remember my dear late father.

155
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.565
Perhaps, but it is a
weapon nevertheless.

156
00:23:22.194 --> 00:23:23.946
Young man, why are you here?

157
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:28.700
My mother said that you were the only
man of authority to retrieve the sword.

158
00:23:41.171 --> 00:23:43.841
All of these are from officers
who were sentenced to die.

159
00:23:46.718 --> 00:23:48.846
Did no one think to attach
names to any of them?

160
00:23:50.973 --> 00:23:53.892
No, there are no names.

161
00:24:18.542 --> 00:24:19.668
General Bonaparte?

162
00:24:30.095 --> 00:24:31.180
Thank you.

163
00:24:37.978 --> 00:24:39.938
Is there reason to
introduce myself?

164
00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:42.900
No, General.

165
00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:44.818
Good.

166
00:24:46.862 --> 00:24:49.364
My compliments to the
chef of this fine family.

167
00:25:10.427 --> 00:25:12.095
Would you like to sit closer?

168
00:25:29.112 --> 00:25:30.822
Do I look like I'm in love?

169
00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:34.993
Do you find him without appeal?

170
00:25:40.123 --> 00:25:41.375
No.

171
00:25:41.458 --> 00:25:43.126
Then perhaps that is enough.

172
00:25:48.507 --> 00:25:50.592
Do not underestimate your grace.

173
00:26:41.476 --> 00:26:43.645
When you look at me, do
you see an aristocrat?

174
00:26:47.858 --> 00:26:48.859
No.

175
00:26:52.696 --> 00:26:54.740
My husband had more
than one lover.

176
00:26:57.034 --> 00:26:59.912
And when his head was cut off,
all his mistresses watched.

177
00:27:06.835 --> 00:27:10.380
When I was in prison, I was told the
only way to survive was to get pregnant.

178
00:27:12.132 --> 00:27:14.468
So, General…

179
00:27:20.933 --> 00:27:23.519
do I need warn you
of my indiscretions?

180
00:27:25.479 --> 00:27:26.480
No, madame.

181
00:27:28.065 --> 00:27:30.150
Does where I have
been concern you?

182
00:27:35.447 --> 00:27:36.448
No, madame.

183
00:27:54.007 --> 00:27:56.093
If you look down,
you'll see a surprise.

184
00:27:57.469 --> 00:27:59.888
And once you see it,
you will always want it.

185
00:28:16.488 --> 00:28:19.700
People of France, don't be
fooled. There are more of us!

186
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.369
We can occupy this Convention!

187
00:28:23.078 --> 00:28:24.997
Long live the king!

188
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.250
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

189
00:28:40.095 --> 00:28:42.306
No doubt you've seen the
chaos in the streets.

190
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:43.390
Yes.

191
00:28:44.308 --> 00:28:46.018
There is a belief
amongst the Committee

192
00:28:46.101 --> 00:28:48.979
that there is an attack on the
Council coming by this mob.

193
00:28:50.314 --> 00:28:54.651
I have less than 4,000 troops and
very little in the way of weapons.

194
00:28:55.694 --> 00:28:59.656
There are 40 cannons in Sablons. I
could have them here in three hours.

195
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.658
This mob is 20,000 strong.

196
00:29:02.701 --> 00:29:03.702
Yes.

197
00:29:07.748 --> 00:29:11.835
As my second-in-command,
what would you intend to do

198
00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:14.630
if this assignment of defense
was transferred to you?

199
00:29:21.386 --> 00:29:24.598
I accept, on the condition that
I command this as I see fit.

200
00:29:24.681 --> 00:29:26.266
Without interruption.

201
00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:29.728
I will not lead as
second-in-command.

202
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:39.696
Come on!

203
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.886
Fire!

204
00:30:22.322 --> 00:30:27.369
According to the law of
20th September, 1792,

205
00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:31.164
Marie-Josèphe-Rose Tascher,

206
00:30:31.248 --> 00:30:36.295
born 23rd June,
1767, in Martinique,

207
00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.133
accepts as her husband
Napoleon Bonaparte,

208
00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:47.216
born February, 1768,
in Ajaccio, Corsica.

209
00:30:49.308 --> 00:30:50.601
Do you consent?

210
00:30:50.684 --> 00:30:51.685
- Yes.
- I do.

211
00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:53.604
Do you consent?

212
00:30:56.398 --> 00:30:57.816
Yes. I do.

213
00:30:58.609 --> 00:31:01.486
I declare you
united in marriage.

214
00:31:22.883 --> 00:31:24.760
To the savior of the Republic!

215
00:31:24.843 --> 00:31:26.512
And to Madam Bonaparte.

216
00:31:26.595 --> 00:31:28.096
To Madam Bonaparte.

217
00:31:46.281 --> 00:31:48.325
This guy right next to me?

218
00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:02.047
He wants my saber.

219
00:32:18.438 --> 00:32:20.774
Let that good work
make us a son.

220
00:32:36.582 --> 00:32:37.916
Dear Joséphine,

221
00:32:38.876 --> 00:32:43.088
I follow in the footsteps of
Alexander the Great and Caesar,

222
00:32:43.172 --> 00:32:45.507
as I have been sent
to liberate Egypt.

223
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:48.802
I have 40,000 men,

224
00:32:48.886 --> 00:32:52.890
and the sights are wondrous,
and the weather is stifling hot.

225
00:32:54.558 --> 00:32:57.978
I have already conquered Italy,
who surrendered without conflict.

226
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.275
The Directory has approved
my plan for attacking England

227
00:33:03.358 --> 00:33:04.860
through their eastern empire.

228
00:33:05.819 --> 00:33:09.698
But my achievements seem
slight, as they keep us apart.

229
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.060
Dear wife,

230
00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:41.688
This love I have for
you is a kind of death.

231
00:33:42.606 --> 00:33:44.983
There is no survival
for me except in you.

232
00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:46.485
Hello again.

233
00:33:46.568 --> 00:33:47.819
What are you doing?

234
00:33:48.403 --> 00:33:49.488
No letters from you.

235
00:33:49.571 --> 00:33:50.614
Good morning, Lucille.

236
00:33:50.697 --> 00:33:53.075
If you loved me, you'd
write me twice a day.

237
00:33:53.951 --> 00:33:56.370
Tell me there are no
snakes in your bed,

238
00:33:56.453 --> 00:33:59.748
in your legs,
inside what is mine.

239
00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:02.501
You must write me and tell me

240
00:34:02.584 --> 00:34:06.088
that you realize that I love you
beyond the limits of imagination,

241
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.091
that only you can please me.

242
00:36:30.107 --> 00:36:34.862
Are there limits to
what I can tell you?

243
00:36:36.905 --> 00:36:37.948
There shouldn't be.

244
00:36:39.992 --> 00:36:42.995
Should I tell you something at the
risk of giving you personal pain?

245
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.081
Yes.

246
00:36:53.213 --> 00:36:57.801
Your wife has taken a lover
named Hippolyte Charles.

247
00:37:18.363 --> 00:37:20.616
- You expect me to believe this?
- Yes.

248
00:37:22.743 --> 00:37:24.536
That my wife would
do this to me?

249
00:37:26.205 --> 00:37:27.206
Yes.

250
00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:39.968
No dessert for
you. You may leave.

251
00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.932
I would never lie to you.

252
00:38:01.532 --> 00:38:02.533
How do you know this?

253
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.376
Lucille is my lover.
She writes to me.

254
00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:15.963
Joséphine's lady-in-waiting
is your lover?

255
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:31.103
Prepare two frigates and two smaller
vessels in the greatest secrecy.

256
00:38:32.563 --> 00:38:33.897
I'm returning home.

257
00:38:34.523 --> 00:38:35.524
Napoleon,

258
00:38:36.275 --> 00:38:38.277
this will be seen as desertion.

259
00:38:40.988 --> 00:38:44.575
General Kléber will be informed of his
succession in command after I've left.

260
00:38:53.709 --> 00:38:56.003
Napoleon the victorious!

261
00:39:46.553 --> 00:39:47.804
Where's my wife?

262
00:39:47.888 --> 00:39:49.640
She has left to
greet you in Lyon.

263
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.309
Do not lie to me.
Where is my wife?

264
00:39:52.851 --> 00:39:54.603
She left earlier today, General.

265
00:39:54.686 --> 00:39:56.563
- Lyon?
- Yes, sir.

266
00:39:56.647 --> 00:39:59.775
The entire world knows of
my arrival, but not my wife?

267
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.119
What kind of creature are you?

268
00:40:55.247 --> 00:40:59.751
How could you care so little
for me and my feelings?

269
00:41:01.128 --> 00:41:03.714
You are a selfish little pig.

270
00:41:06.175 --> 00:41:08.177
Do you think so lowly of me?

271
00:41:09.511 --> 00:41:11.388
No. I don't.

272
00:41:11.471 --> 00:41:12.472
Then why?

273
00:41:15.225 --> 00:41:18.270
Because you're what? Say it.

274
00:41:22.524 --> 00:41:23.525
I'm sorry.

275
00:41:24.443 --> 00:41:25.694
That's not enough.

276
00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:30.449
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you to say

277
00:41:30.532 --> 00:41:33.827
that I am the most important
thing in the world!

278
00:41:34.995 --> 00:41:36.163
You are.

279
00:41:36.246 --> 00:41:38.707
- Say it!
- You're...

280
00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:43.462
You're the most important thing
in my life, in the world. You a...

281
00:41:43.545 --> 00:41:46.882
- And without me, you are nothing.
- I'm nothing.

282
00:41:46.965 --> 00:41:48.634
And you will do anything!

283
00:41:49.718 --> 00:41:51.053
I'll do anything.

284
00:41:54.598 --> 00:41:56.225
I'm not built like other men.

285
00:41:59.603 --> 00:42:01.939
And I'm not subject
to petty insecurity.

286
00:42:07.611 --> 00:42:08.904
You're a beast.

287
00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:15.035
I feel sorry for you.

288
00:42:19.373 --> 00:42:20.666
You want to be great?

289
00:42:28.507 --> 00:42:30.926
You are nothing without me.

290
00:42:32.469 --> 00:42:33.470
Say it.

291
00:42:41.854 --> 00:42:42.938
Say it.

292
00:42:49.111 --> 00:42:54.533
You are just a brute that
is nothing without me.

293
00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:59.872
I am just a brute that
is nothing without you.

294
00:42:59.955 --> 00:43:00.831
Yes.

295
00:43:00.914 --> 00:43:06.914
You are nothing without
me or your mother.

296
00:43:11.258 --> 00:43:12.342
My mother…

297
00:43:27.274 --> 00:43:28.442
Did you have affairs?

298
00:43:31.153 --> 00:43:32.154
Of course I did.

299
00:43:39.494 --> 00:43:40.954
And did you love them?

300
00:43:42.581 --> 00:43:44.625
No. No, I did not.

301
00:43:50.923 --> 00:43:52.049
Were they pretty?

302
00:43:54.259 --> 00:43:56.094
Yes, some of them.

303
00:43:59.097 --> 00:44:00.599
They served their purpose.

304
00:44:02.851 --> 00:44:03.852
More than I do?

305
00:44:04.811 --> 00:44:08.649
They cried less. That
made them more attractive.

306
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:13.070
Don't...

307
00:44:14.404 --> 00:44:16.949
Don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me.

308
00:44:20.744 --> 00:44:22.246
Just don't leave me.

309
00:44:23.997 --> 00:44:27.084
You don't have to forgive me. Just
promise me you won't leave again.

310
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.552
What is it that made you
desert your troops in Egypt?

311
00:44:40.055 --> 00:44:41.056
Citizens…

312
00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:44.601
what country are we in?

313
00:44:48.397 --> 00:44:51.400
Because she doesn't resemble
the France that I left.

314
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:57.990
Who should be responsible for
her governance while I'm away?

315
00:44:59.616 --> 00:45:01.743
Because it is not
you, Citizen Gohier.

316
00:45:02.578 --> 00:45:03.579
It is not you.

317
00:45:03.662 --> 00:45:07.374
It certainly is not you. Although
you're very good at scowling.

318
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.421
It is not you, Barras.

319
00:45:12.504 --> 00:45:13.547
Or you, Talleyrand.

320
00:45:14.965 --> 00:45:15.966
Or you, Sieyès.

321
00:45:17.509 --> 00:45:18.510
So, who?

322
00:45:20.012 --> 00:45:22.639
Who should be responsible?
Fouché, do you have any ideas?

323
00:45:24.016 --> 00:45:25.017
No?

324
00:45:27.227 --> 00:45:30.022
I have returned to France
to find her bankrupt.

325
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.775
Printing money that
is spent within hours,

326
00:45:35.694 --> 00:45:37.988
the Austro-Russian
overrun of Italy,

327
00:45:39.072 --> 00:45:41.325
the Anglo-Russian
occupation of Holland,

328
00:45:42.075 --> 00:45:47.956
and what appears to be the imminent
invasion of France herself.

329
00:45:50.918 --> 00:45:54.421
And yet, you accuse
me of desertion.

330
00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:59.218
Added to which the discovery
that my wife is a slut.

331
00:46:12.397 --> 00:46:17.569
The only thing that every French citizen
can agree on is that you are our Caesar.

332
00:46:21.156 --> 00:46:22.157
What do you want?

333
00:46:26.245 --> 00:46:27.246
Well…

334
00:46:29.706 --> 00:46:33.168
the people would accept my
rule if I have your support.

335
00:46:35.546 --> 00:46:40.175
Like you, though, I believe
that the Directory is corrupt.

336
00:46:41.802 --> 00:46:46.723
But together, we can save this country
from a restoration of the monarchy,

337
00:46:47.683 --> 00:46:49.935
and we can preserve the
ideals of the Revolution.

338
00:46:52.646 --> 00:46:56.400
And I think that a seizure
of power is possible

339
00:46:57.734 --> 00:46:59.570
with your help,
at the right time.

340
00:46:59.653 --> 00:47:02.865
And I think this
is the right time.

341
00:47:03.615 --> 00:47:06.285
So, you expect me
to be your sword?

342
00:47:12.916 --> 00:47:17.754
I expect that a coup d'état,
well-timed, well-executed…

343
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.302
could transfer power into
the hands of three consuls:

344
00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:25.512
myself, Ducos…

345
00:47:28.098 --> 00:47:29.141
and you.

346
00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.645
I'm inviting you to
the winning side.

347
00:47:37.941 --> 00:47:40.485
It's a simple letter of
resignation we would like you to...

348
00:47:40.569 --> 00:47:42.696
I am not signing anything.

349
00:47:42.779 --> 00:47:46.074
You can piss before
I sign anything away!

350
00:47:46.158 --> 00:47:47.159
Gentlemen.

351
00:47:56.126 --> 00:47:57.544
Who's doing this?

352
00:47:58.879 --> 00:48:00.047
Good morning, Paul.

353
00:48:03.217 --> 00:48:05.344
I'm going to make this
very simple for you.

354
00:48:06.345 --> 00:48:09.723
I have documents announcing your
resignation from the Council.

355
00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:13.393
You must retire before you
have your breakfast, please.

356
00:48:14.645 --> 00:48:18.982
Tell them I return with joy to
the ranks of simple citizen.

357
00:48:20.943 --> 00:48:21.944
I shall.

358
00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:29.201
There are some gentlemen
here to see you.

359
00:48:30.035 --> 00:48:33.956
Citizen Moulins, we have a letter
of resignation for you to sign.

360
00:48:34.831 --> 00:48:37.584
- No. I am eating my breakfast.
- No.

361
00:48:37.668 --> 00:48:40.337
I am enjoying a
succulent breakfast.

362
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:44.758
This is outrageous! I shall finish
my breakfast before you touch me!

363
00:48:44.842 --> 00:48:47.678
- No!
- Enjoy your breakfast.

364
00:49:09.283 --> 00:49:10.576
Director!

365
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.787
I believe the time has come
to demand an explanation.

366
00:49:13.871 --> 00:49:14.872
Hear, hear!

367
00:49:16.248 --> 00:49:20.711
This emergency session is to
draw a list of nominations

368
00:49:20.794 --> 00:49:25.299
for a new Directory to
deal with the threat...

369
00:49:26.008 --> 00:49:27.968
the threat of the royalists.

370
00:49:28.051 --> 00:49:30.179
We are being asked
to pass a resolution

371
00:49:30.262 --> 00:49:33.098
forming a provisional
government to three councils:

372
00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:37.728
General Bonaparte and Citizen
Sieyès and Roger Ducos.

373
00:49:39.313 --> 00:49:41.440
Where are the five
members of the Directory?

374
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.569
Have they magically disappeared?

375
00:49:46.195 --> 00:49:50.699
And we are here, surrounded by
troops, isolated far from Paris.

376
00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:52.367
Order!

377
00:49:52.451 --> 00:49:55.287
This is becoming
increasingly clear:

378
00:49:56.205 --> 00:49:59.082
that your brother,
Napoleon Bonaparte,

379
00:50:00.292 --> 00:50:04.171
with his show of military
might, is acting as an outlaw.

380
00:50:06.089 --> 00:50:07.424
I vow to solve this matter.

381
00:50:07.508 --> 00:50:11.261
And that this is a ridiculous
and poorly executed takeover.

382
00:50:11.345 --> 00:50:13.305
A power-hungry upstart.

383
00:50:13.805 --> 00:50:16.016
Enough!

384
00:50:16.099 --> 00:50:20.020
If there is any question of what
is happening here, I will answer!

385
00:50:20.103 --> 00:50:21.396
How dare you!

386
00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:25.317
This is... You have
violated the constitution!

387
00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.444
- You have...
- Hold him!

388
00:50:28.028 --> 00:50:29.029
Get him!

389
00:50:36.787 --> 00:50:38.997
- Arrest him!
- Stop him!

390
00:50:40.707 --> 00:50:42.000
Oh, fuck!

391
00:50:47.506 --> 00:50:48.882
Kill him!

392
00:50:57.057 --> 00:50:58.058
Let me through!

393
00:51:00.853 --> 00:51:02.104
Right.

394
00:51:02.187 --> 00:51:06.275
We are being terrorized by
deputies armed with daggers!

395
00:51:06.817 --> 00:51:10.279
And these madmen have
outlawed themselves

396
00:51:10.362 --> 00:51:12.990
by their attempt on the
liberty of this country!

397
00:51:13.073 --> 00:51:15.576
- They're trying to kill me!
- They're trying to kill him.

398
00:51:16.076 --> 00:51:17.744
Open these doors!

399
00:51:22.374 --> 00:51:24.042
Let us out of here!

400
00:51:24.126 --> 00:51:28.964
I will kill my brother if he betrays
the freedom of the French people!

401
00:51:30.424 --> 00:51:31.925
Get in there now!

402
00:51:32.009 --> 00:51:33.010
Fuck.

403
00:51:38.098 --> 00:51:40.225
Move. Get back. Back.

404
00:51:41.518 --> 00:51:42.895
Move it!

405
00:51:44.771 --> 00:51:47.900
- Back. Move back.
- Move back. Out of the way.

406
00:51:48.567 --> 00:51:50.652
Move. Backwards.

407
00:51:57.117 --> 00:51:58.452
Good luck, brother.

408
00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:10.172
Stand aside.

409
00:52:23.101 --> 00:52:24.353
Shall we vote?

410
00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:28.857
Where are we going?

411
00:52:31.652 --> 00:52:33.570
All our harsh words
are behind us.

412
00:52:36.406 --> 00:52:38.951
I need you to be my
most tender friend.

413
00:52:42.788 --> 00:52:45.958
Over this door is our destiny.

414
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:04.703
Present arms!

415
00:54:17.257 --> 00:54:19.343
- First Consul.
- My lord.

416
00:54:20.344 --> 00:54:21.345
Milady.

417
00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:27.142
- Citizen Bonaparte.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

418
00:54:27.226 --> 00:54:28.769
- First Consul.
- Citizen Bonaparte.

419
00:54:28.852 --> 00:54:30.062
First Consul.

420
00:54:33.607 --> 00:54:34.900
Come, little one.

421
00:54:35.609 --> 00:54:38.529
You get into the bed
of your master's.

422
00:54:51.959 --> 00:54:54.753
Hello, madame!

423
00:54:54.837 --> 00:54:56.421
Hello, good evening.

424
00:55:01.969 --> 00:55:03.595
Mother, the Duke of Avignon.

425
00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:04.847
It's good to meet you.

426
00:55:16.024 --> 00:55:17.359
Could this be Joséphine?

427
00:55:18.569 --> 00:55:21.196
- Mother, Joséphine. Joséphine, Mother.
- Good to see you.

428
00:55:22.906 --> 00:55:23.991
It's Charles.

429
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:25.951
This way.

430
00:55:35.586 --> 00:55:39.173
"Your Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity."

431
00:55:39.256 --> 00:55:40.256
Let me try again.

432
00:55:42.676 --> 00:55:45.304
Your Royal Majesty,
England and France

433
00:55:45.387 --> 00:55:48.182
- are wasting their prosperity…
- Your Majesty.

434
00:55:48.807 --> 00:55:49.975
What did I say?

435
00:55:52.686 --> 00:55:54.271
"Your Royal Majesty."

436
00:55:55.522 --> 00:55:56.607
"Your Royal Ma"...

437
00:55:57.733 --> 00:56:01.528
Your Majesty, England and France
are wasting their prosperity.

438
00:56:03.906 --> 00:56:06.325
I am not ashamed to
take the initiative.

439
00:56:06.408 --> 00:56:09.161
I have, I think, sufficiently
proven to the whole world

440
00:56:09.244 --> 00:56:12.080
that I do not fear
the chances of war.

441
00:56:13.415 --> 00:56:17.711
But peace is my heartfelt
wish for England and France.

442
00:56:19.129 --> 00:56:20.130
Read it back to me.

443
00:56:21.048 --> 00:56:24.551
I have notified all foreign powers
of your accession to the Consul,

444
00:56:24.635 --> 00:56:28.138
I have addressed letters to
all diplomatic agents abroad,

445
00:56:28.222 --> 00:56:32.142
and I understand that you have made
friendly overtures of peace to England.

446
00:56:32.226 --> 00:56:33.519
Caulaincourt.

447
00:56:34.561 --> 00:56:37.356
What I need from you is
a better understanding

448
00:56:37.439 --> 00:56:39.233
of the Russian Tsar Alexander.

449
00:56:39.942 --> 00:56:42.778
Would you consider the tsar
an ally to England or France?

450
00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:48.575
Well, I would think that his trade
with England is more beneficial to him

451
00:56:48.659 --> 00:56:50.077
than his trade with France.

452
00:56:50.661 --> 00:56:54.790
And do you have a sense of British
influence in the Russian courts?

453
00:56:54.873 --> 00:56:57.376
I do not, but I imagine
it is quite robust.

454
00:56:58.669 --> 00:56:59.753
Robust?

455
00:57:04.842 --> 00:57:07.678
What kind of man is
he? Describe him.

456
00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:10.597
Well, he's young.

457
00:57:12.891 --> 00:57:13.891
He's vain.

458
00:57:15.477 --> 00:57:17.479
He's popular, and he
wishes to remain so.

459
00:57:17.563 --> 00:57:18.647
He's popular?

460
00:57:21.441 --> 00:57:22.442
Really?

461
00:57:22.526 --> 00:57:26.154
His greatest fear is to be killed
in his bed, like his father.

462
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:32.786
This makes him dangerously fickle
to whoever last has his attention.

463
00:57:33.912 --> 00:57:36.999
So he needs an ally that
he can also call a friend.

464
00:57:43.964 --> 00:57:45.174
No more bets.

465
00:57:48.844 --> 00:57:50.220
What a surprise.

466
00:57:50.888 --> 00:57:52.264
How nice to see you out.

467
00:57:53.348 --> 00:57:54.600
Excuse me, gentlemen.

468
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.603
Good evening. I'm just
trying to lose some money.

469
00:57:59.021 --> 00:58:01.273
Well, after this hand, why
don't you come and join me?

470
00:58:01.356 --> 00:58:03.066
I'm at my usual table.

471
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:04.318
That's a lovely idea.

472
00:58:06.361 --> 00:58:07.362
Good evening.

473
00:58:09.948 --> 00:58:10.949
Did you hear?

474
00:58:12.784 --> 00:58:17.706
Your Majesty received a letter of
peace from the First Consul today.

475
00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:23.170
Monsieur Talleyrand,
if I may be honest?

476
00:58:23.253 --> 00:58:24.254
Of course.

477
00:58:24.338 --> 00:58:29.092
Austria's coalition with England is in
such a strong position against France,

478
00:58:29.176 --> 00:58:33.055
that these peace
overtures are clearly

479
00:58:33.138 --> 00:58:35.891
only for your handling
of French public opinion.

480
00:58:37.351 --> 00:58:38.519
Oh, my friend.

481
00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:42.231
You know me so well.

482
00:58:43.398 --> 00:58:46.860
Yes, it is true. It is public
opinion Napoleon is after.

483
00:58:46.944 --> 00:58:49.905
But my warning to you is
that he's as hungry for it

484
00:58:49.988 --> 00:58:52.074
as any man in the
history of the world.

485
00:58:52.157 --> 00:58:53.951
So my suggestion, with respect,

486
00:58:54.034 --> 00:58:57.788
would be to take this little
offering of peace from him…

487
00:59:00.832 --> 00:59:06.547
or suffer the consequences from
a man bent on peace at any cost.

488
00:59:09.091 --> 00:59:11.802
The English ambassador, Lord
Whitworth, has arrived, Consul.

489
00:59:20.686 --> 00:59:23.897
Do not look at me as if you
don't know what I'm about to say.

490
00:59:25.607 --> 00:59:28.318
Are you aware of my letter
of peace to your king?

491
00:59:29.111 --> 00:59:30.153
I am not.

492
00:59:31.613 --> 00:59:32.906
Shall I repeat it?

493
00:59:34.199 --> 00:59:35.617
No, you may not.

494
00:59:36.743 --> 00:59:39.121
Take this as a
warning to your king.

495
00:59:39.204 --> 00:59:41.874
I will keep you
guessing and scared.

496
00:59:41.957 --> 00:59:44.084
You will watch your
borders and your back,

497
00:59:44.168 --> 00:59:47.087
and your manners are bound,
sooner or later, to be French.

498
00:59:47.171 --> 00:59:49.548
I will offer no more
letters of peace,

499
00:59:49.631 --> 00:59:54.052
and I will take the lack of a swift
reply as an act of disrespect!

500
00:59:54.136 --> 00:59:57.264
You think you're so great
because you have boats!

501
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.937
'Tis a shame such a great
man should have no manners.

502
01:00:17.326 --> 01:00:18.327
Yes?

503
01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:21.914
Are you pleased?

504
01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:27.085
Are you about to tell me
something that will make me angry?

505
01:00:28.045 --> 01:00:29.421
Let's hope not.

506
01:00:29.505 --> 01:00:34.134
The European families think nothing
more of you than a Corsican thug.

507
01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:35.885
Therefore,

508
01:00:36.678 --> 01:00:40.349
I'm going to suggest something
that's been a long time arriving.

509
01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:46.063
I suggest that you abandon your
role as First Consul of France

510
01:00:47.022 --> 01:00:51.443
in exchange for the title
"Victorious Consul."

511
01:00:53.487 --> 01:00:55.906
By another name, "king."

512
01:00:58.867 --> 01:00:59.868
What?

513
01:01:01.453 --> 01:01:02.454
"King."

514
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.041
Yes, king.

515
01:01:08.627 --> 01:01:09.628
King?

516
01:01:29.648 --> 01:01:31.525
My hair has been set.

517
01:01:32.609 --> 01:01:34.403
The way you like it.

518
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:40.993
Oh, you filthy man. My
hair has been set now.

519
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:47.541
I have the most beautiful wife.

520
01:01:47.624 --> 01:01:49.543
I... All right, come on then.

521
01:01:52.588 --> 01:01:53.589
Hat off.

522
01:02:00.804 --> 01:02:02.598
Give me your hand.

523
01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:05.517
- You feel that?
- What?

524
01:02:07.144 --> 01:02:08.270
Can you feel that?

525
01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:10.230
That's yours.

526
01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:11.940
It's yours.

527
01:02:12.024 --> 01:02:13.025
Thank you.

528
01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:37.758
Stop.

529
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.927
Why aren't you pregnant?

530
01:02:44.223 --> 01:02:47.518
Is that a question, or
is that an accusation?

531
01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:52.940
It was a question.

532
01:02:55.317 --> 01:02:56.527
Now it's an accusation.

533
01:03:00.239 --> 01:03:03.242
Well, I've seen Dr. Corvisart,
and he has no answer.

534
01:03:07.621 --> 01:03:10.290
Only that I do what Madame
de Rémusat has done.

535
01:03:12.668 --> 01:03:13.669
Which is?

536
01:03:15.212 --> 01:03:16.213
Which is…

537
01:03:18.799 --> 01:03:21.510
along with hopeful thinking
and a bit of red wine,

538
01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:24.429
he suggested I take the
waters at Aix-la-Chapelle.

539
01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:29.101
And why haven't you?

540
01:03:30.477 --> 01:03:33.355
As wife of the First Consul,
I haven't found the time.

541
01:03:33.438 --> 01:03:36.358
I spend many hours
cleaning up after you.

542
01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:42.364
Find the time.

543
01:03:44.825 --> 01:03:47.536
I don't need to explain to you
the importance of this, do I?

544
01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:49.788
What, you want an heir?

545
01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:52.332
I want one now.

546
01:04:10.017 --> 01:04:11.435
Oh, my God.

547
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:02.861
May God affirm
you on his throne,

548
01:05:04.196 --> 01:05:09.159
and Christ give you to rule
with him in his eternal kingdom.

549
01:05:35.227 --> 01:05:38.522
I found the crown of
France in the gutter.

550
01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:44.862
I picked it up with the tip
of my sword and cleaned it…

551
01:05:46.947 --> 01:05:49.074
and place it atop my own head.

552
01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:20.981
The most glorious, the
most august Napoleon,

553
01:06:21.064 --> 01:06:23.609
emperor of the French,

554
01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:27.029
is crowned and enthroned!

555
01:06:27.863 --> 01:06:29.573
Long live the emperor!

556
01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:32.159
Long live the emperor!

557
01:06:32.743 --> 01:06:34.661
Long live the emperor!

558
01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:16.495
I do not support this idea.

559
01:07:16.578 --> 01:07:19.248
You suggest divorce
after years of debate.

560
01:07:19.331 --> 01:07:21.124
You can see that
it has me divided.

561
01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:27.089
I am not ambitious.

562
01:07:27.172 --> 01:07:29.007
I've never declared
war with anyone.

563
01:07:32.761 --> 01:07:33.762
No.

564
01:07:36.014 --> 01:07:40.352
You are the greatest leader
in the history of the world

565
01:07:40.435 --> 01:07:42.396
and the world's only
chance at peace.

566
01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:51.363
The security of the empire and peace
in the world depends upon an heir.

567
01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:00.372
It was an option.

568
01:08:02.291 --> 01:08:03.792
And I said it at the time.

569
01:08:11.049 --> 01:08:12.676
Are you enjoying yourself?

570
01:08:14.636 --> 01:08:18.098
I'm going to war to
defend our people,

571
01:08:18.182 --> 01:08:20.642
and my wife cannot
provide me an heir.

572
01:08:24.354 --> 01:08:27.024
If you do not bear
me a child tonight,

573
01:08:28.817 --> 01:08:30.359
there will be a divorce.

574
01:08:32.738 --> 01:08:36.116
Hasn't been enough lovemaking
in this home to bear a child.

575
01:08:37.201 --> 01:08:38.535
Yes, there has.

576
01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:43.372
There have been
years of it. Years.

577
01:08:45.125 --> 01:08:46.542
And with more than just me.

578
01:08:48.045 --> 01:08:51.423
And still you are empty.

579
01:08:51.506 --> 01:08:53.008
And you're fat.

580
01:08:54.801 --> 01:08:58.055
I enjoy my meals. I do.

581
01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:00.724
Destiny has brought me here.

582
01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:03.268
Destiny has brought
me this lamb chop.

583
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.711
Joséphine.

584
01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:35.259
Come then.

585
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.761
Come.

586
01:09:44.475 --> 01:09:48.354
I love your talents
and your taste.

587
01:09:50.607 --> 01:09:53.277
And while I'm away, I
will miss your grace.

588
01:09:54.027 --> 01:09:55.320
And your dignity.

589
01:09:56.613 --> 01:09:58.407
And I will come back to you.

590
01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:33.901
To today's victory.

591
01:10:35.235 --> 01:10:37.237
Look, I'm always here
for you, Francis.

592
01:10:38.238 --> 01:10:41.533
But I must admit, I'm overwhelmed with
the excitement of the battlefield.

593
01:10:42.576 --> 01:10:44.369
I should not deceive
you, Alexander.

594
01:10:44.453 --> 01:10:47.581
This battle against him will
be brutal and terrifying.

595
01:11:13.357 --> 01:11:14.233
Come on!

596
01:11:14.316 --> 01:11:16.193
Get in defensive position!

597
01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:28.455
My good wife, Joséphine.

598
01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:32.960
My God, it's cold here.
I miss your warmth.

599
01:11:34.378 --> 01:11:38.006
On this day, we celebrate the first
anniversary of our coronation.

600
01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:42.511
My previous ally has now
joined with my enemy.

601
01:11:43.637 --> 01:11:47.474
The Russian Tsar Alexander joined
forces with the prince of Austria.

602
01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:51.186
I have heard that he's been
studying the art of war

603
01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:53.021
and trying to emulate
my battle tactics.

604
01:11:53.105 --> 01:11:54.022
More fires.

605
01:11:54.106 --> 01:11:55.524
He tries to copy me,

606
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:58.944
but he is a little boy who
will make a terrible mistake.

607
01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:04.074
I am certain I will bring the laurels of
another glorious victory to my army today.

608
01:12:05.117 --> 01:12:07.286
Yours, Napoleon.

609
01:12:22.759 --> 01:12:25.596
Hey, tie it from the back.
Peg that corner to the ground.

610
01:12:25.679 --> 01:12:26.680
That's it.

611
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:34.980
Fuck.

612
01:13:31.745 --> 01:13:33.038
Your Majesty.

613
01:13:33.997 --> 01:13:35.499
We are discovered.

614
01:13:37.084 --> 01:13:38.085
Good.

615
01:13:39.503 --> 01:13:40.671
Tell the men to rest.

616
01:14:11.118 --> 01:14:16.123
I-N-F-S.

617
01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:19.209
Infantry sighted.

618
01:14:33.348 --> 01:14:36.852
I-M-T.

619
01:14:39.396 --> 01:14:40.606
Imminent!

620
01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:45.360
Stand to!

621
01:14:45.444 --> 01:14:48.113
- Stand to!
- Stand to!

622
01:14:48.197 --> 01:14:49.865
- Stand to!
- Stand to.

623
01:14:49.948 --> 01:14:53.160
- Wake up, men. Get ready!
- Stand to!

624
01:14:53.243 --> 01:14:54.912
Come on, get up!

625
01:15:22.397 --> 01:15:23.607
Wait.

626
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:25.150
Ready!

627
01:15:25.234 --> 01:15:28.820
Wait! Let them think they
have the higher ground.

628
01:16:14.867 --> 01:16:16.076
Fire!

629
01:16:19.371 --> 01:16:20.622
Fire away!

630
01:16:28.338 --> 01:16:29.548
Fire at will!

631
01:16:36.054 --> 01:16:37.139
Send in the infantry.

632
01:16:37.222 --> 01:16:39.600
Take their position on the
higher ground. At the double.

633
01:16:39.683 --> 01:16:42.477
Take the ground!

634
01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:17.137
Cavalry from the west.
Pierce their flanks.

635
01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:34.238
Retreat! Withdraw!

636
01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:35.822
Withdraw!

637
01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:48.961
It's a trap!

638
01:17:53.507 --> 01:17:55.175
Retreat!

639
01:18:33.463 --> 01:18:36.592
- Uncover the cannons.
- Cannons!

640
01:18:40.888 --> 01:18:43.140
- Fire!
- Fire!

641
01:18:47.019 --> 01:18:48.145
Reloading!

642
01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:08.040
Keep to the one side.

643
01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:21.428
Off the ice!

644
01:20:11.603 --> 01:20:14.314
Renounce, sir. We're pinned in.

645
01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:19.403
Off the ice! Withdraw!

646
01:20:26.285 --> 01:20:27.494
Cut off their retreat.

647
01:21:18.754 --> 01:21:21.548
Francis. So nice to
finally meet you.

648
01:21:22.132 --> 01:21:23.717
Please come in where it's warm.

649
01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:26.970
- Thank you.
- You must forgive me.

650
01:21:27.054 --> 01:21:29.556
This has been my only palace
for the last two months.

651
01:21:30.766 --> 01:21:34.770
Seems very agreeable. You
make excellent use of it.

652
01:21:34.853 --> 01:21:36.813
Well, we do what we
can on the battlefield.

653
01:21:37.606 --> 01:21:39.149
Yes, we do, don't we?

654
01:21:39.983 --> 01:21:42.152
It's nice to finally
meet another emperor.

655
01:21:43.445 --> 01:21:45.697
Where, may I ask, is Alexander?

656
01:21:45.781 --> 01:21:48.158
Are we waiting for his
arrival before we get started?

657
01:21:48.242 --> 01:21:51.954
I do not believe he
will be joining us.

658
01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:54.540
He's beside himself with rage.

659
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.213
I realize I must compliment you for
making me commit an enormous error.

660
01:22:02.297 --> 01:22:04.049
- An error?
- Yes.

661
01:22:05.175 --> 01:22:06.593
What error have you made?

662
01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:11.723
To be speaking with you here and
accepting this invitation for peace,

663
01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:14.309
I have not followed
up my victory.

664
01:22:15.769 --> 01:22:19.022
I could have taken the whole
Russian and Austrian army prisoners.

665
01:22:21.942 --> 01:22:22.943
Yes.

666
01:22:23.652 --> 01:22:25.654
But after all, there
will be less tears.

667
01:22:27.197 --> 01:22:31.535
And I know you will remember
this gesture of kindness. Yes?

668
01:22:32.953 --> 01:22:33.954
Thank you.

669
01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:39.626
Toast?

670
01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:54.760
To friendship, a glorious peace
and the best interest of Europe.

671
01:23:02.608 --> 01:23:03.608
Burgundy.

672
01:23:26.632 --> 01:23:28.842
Hold on. Hey, whoa!

673
01:23:29.635 --> 01:23:31.261
Whoa, we don't say woof. Okay.

674
01:23:33.722 --> 01:23:36.808
That's my boy. Attaboy.

675
01:23:36.892 --> 01:23:38.435
Come here. Sit.

676
01:23:54.117 --> 01:23:57.204
It is time to put this
mystery to rest, Emperor.

677
01:23:57.746 --> 01:24:00.541
I want to know if
it's you or Joséphine.

678
01:24:01.124 --> 01:24:07.124
And to that end, we will conduct
a very practical experiment.

679
01:24:10.759 --> 01:24:13.929
At the end of the
hallway... Take this...

680
01:24:14.805 --> 01:24:18.767
Waiting for you, undressed,
ready to receive,

681
01:24:19.726 --> 01:24:24.189
is 18-year-old Eléonore
Denuelle de La Plaigne.

682
01:24:27.359 --> 01:24:29.528
She's brunette with brown eyes.

683
01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:32.281
And the object of this, well,

684
01:24:32.364 --> 01:24:37.619
hardly unpleasant task is to
see if you can father a child.

685
01:24:38.996 --> 01:24:42.833
And then we will have an
answer to this nagging question

686
01:24:42.916 --> 01:24:47.963
of who is keeping who from an
heir to the throne of France.

687
01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:54.595
Shall we go?

688
01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.555
May I have another, please?

689
01:25:56.406 --> 01:25:58.033
The girl is pregnant.

690
01:25:58.116 --> 01:25:59.576
You made her pregnant.

691
01:26:13.632 --> 01:26:15.008
I know I didn't see her.

692
01:26:22.224 --> 01:26:24.393
When are you going
to insist we divorce?

693
01:26:26.395 --> 01:26:27.896
Isn't that wonderful?

694
01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:33.777
From the only woman that I've ever
loved and given all that I've conquered.

695
01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:39.825
I'm just too tired to wait for you
to tell me what I know is coming.

696
01:26:42.244 --> 01:26:43.495
If you insist.

697
01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:48.959
I'll make it easy for you.

698
01:26:55.257 --> 01:26:57.926
I know you will have
a bastard child.

699
01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:06.935
If I succeed in making the birth of
a boy that I shall call my own son,

700
01:27:07.853 --> 01:27:11.815
I want you as a witness to pretend
the confinement of the empress.

701
01:27:14.401 --> 01:27:15.235
Your Highness,

702
01:27:15.319 --> 01:27:18.780
you are asking me to lie about the
status of the mother of your heir.

703
01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:22.492
That is another way
of putting it, yes.

704
01:27:24.745 --> 01:27:30.501
Emperor, it is my honor
and my duty, of course,

705
01:27:30.584 --> 01:27:32.503
to do as you require of me.

706
01:27:32.586 --> 01:27:36.465
But if asked, I cannot contain
that which I know to be the truth.

707
01:27:37.508 --> 01:27:39.510
And painful though it is,

708
01:27:39.593 --> 01:27:44.097
the truth is that the empress is no
longer capable of bearing you a child.

709
01:27:55.442 --> 01:27:57.653
My good Joséphine.

710
01:28:02.491 --> 01:28:04.117
You know how I've loved you.

711
01:28:07.079 --> 01:28:10.457
It is you, to you alone,

712
01:28:11.667 --> 01:28:15.254
that I owe the few moments of
happiness I have known in this world.

713
01:28:19.216 --> 01:28:22.970
My destiny is more
powerful than my will.

714
01:28:25.055 --> 01:28:31.055
And my affections must yield
to the interests of my people.

715
01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:55.961
The imperial decree for the
dissolution of the marriage

716
01:28:57.129 --> 01:29:00.841
between the Emperor Napoleon
and the Empress Joséphine.

717
01:29:09.474 --> 01:29:14.771
"My people desire that this throne,
where providence has placed me,

718
01:29:15.314 --> 01:29:16.982
would be given to my children.

719
01:29:18.734 --> 01:29:22.905
However, I have lost hope of
having children from my marriage

720
01:29:22.988 --> 01:29:25.657
to my beloved wife,
Empress Joséphine.

721
01:29:26.658 --> 01:29:30.746
I have then been led to listen
only to the good of the state

722
01:29:30.829 --> 01:29:34.249
and to want the dissolution
of years of my life."

723
01:29:41.298 --> 01:29:46.011
You have embellished
my life for 15 years.

724
01:29:48.263 --> 01:29:53.685
The memories of which will remain
forever etched in my heart.

725
01:30:10.035 --> 01:30:13.830
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

726
01:30:16.542 --> 01:30:21.046
She has been deprived of
one day being governed

727
01:30:21.129 --> 01:30:24.967
by the descendants of the man
brought to us by providence

728
01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:27.511
to mend the evils of
a terrible revolution

729
01:30:28.136 --> 01:30:31.515
and restore faith, the
throne and the social order."

730
01:30:37.479 --> 01:30:38.856
Sorry.

731
01:30:40.732 --> 01:30:43.318
- Emperor. Wait.
- Go. No, listen. All right?

732
01:30:43.402 --> 01:30:46.154
This is for your country.
That's what this is, all right?

733
01:30:46.655 --> 01:30:47.739
Now say it.

734
01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:50.409
Say it.

735
01:30:57.124 --> 01:31:00.169
"Our marriage has become an obstacle
for the prosperity of France.

736
01:31:02.171 --> 01:31:04.715
Agreeing to the dissolution
of our marriage,

737
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.801
as I must, does not
change my feelings.

738
01:31:14.016 --> 01:31:20.016
The emperor will have in me
always his truest friend."

739
01:31:54.473 --> 01:31:55.557
Emperor,

740
01:31:56.391 --> 01:31:59.561
you have just pronounced the
word which separates us forever.

741
01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:03.982
Your mistaken
ambition has ever been

742
01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:08.862
and will continue to be the
guide of all your actions.

743
01:32:09.738 --> 01:32:10.948
Nevertheless,

744
01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.202
you can never doubt the sincerity
of my wishes for your happiness.

745
01:32:16.453 --> 01:32:20.040
May it at least afford me some
consolation for my sufferings.

746
01:32:21.166 --> 01:32:23.710
- Yours, Joséphine.
- Thank you.

747
01:32:24.378 --> 01:32:26.713
- Good morning, madame.
- Thank you. What's your name?

748
01:32:26.797 --> 01:32:28.966
- Fleur.
- Fleur. Pleasure.

749
01:33:31.528 --> 01:33:32.529
I miss you.

750
01:33:37.993 --> 01:33:39.995
Marital life is
very agreeable now.

751
01:33:44.791 --> 01:33:47.377
You've shown such
great courage so far.

752
01:33:49.713 --> 01:33:51.215
You must maintain it.

753
01:33:52.633 --> 01:33:55.552
Do not permit yourself
to fall into melancholy.

754
01:34:01.099 --> 01:34:02.809
You look best when you're happy.

755
01:34:07.648 --> 01:34:09.233
Please take care of your health.

756
01:34:10.234 --> 01:34:11.610
It is precious to me.

757
01:34:12.945 --> 01:34:14.279
Will you write me tomorrow?

758
01:34:18.659 --> 01:34:19.785
And the next day?

759
01:34:20.494 --> 01:34:21.495
Yes.

760
01:34:22.579 --> 01:34:23.705
And the day after that?

761
01:34:27.543 --> 01:34:29.378
- And the day after that?
- Yeah.

762
01:34:32.798 --> 01:34:33.799
Good.

763
01:34:44.059 --> 01:34:47.896
Once, an English ambassador
challenged my reasons for war.

764
01:34:48.564 --> 01:34:52.025
He said, "You French,
you fight only for money,

765
01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:54.278
while we English,
we fight for honor."

766
01:34:55.445 --> 01:34:59.116
I replied, "Everyone
fights for what they lack."

767
01:35:02.494 --> 01:35:05.497
This is not your story. This
never happened to you, did it?

768
01:35:05.581 --> 01:35:06.581
Of course it did.

769
01:35:06.623 --> 01:35:08.059
- Of course it did.
- What do you mean?

770
01:35:08.083 --> 01:35:10.127
We had the same saying with
my people and the Turks.

771
01:35:10.627 --> 01:35:11.461
Do you?

772
01:35:11.545 --> 01:35:13.630
The English lack honor.
We can agree on that.

773
01:35:13.714 --> 01:35:14.965
Listen, there is...

774
01:35:17.301 --> 01:35:22.222
There's nothing I think we can agree
more with than our hatred for Britain.

775
01:35:25.559 --> 01:35:30.063
I just have to say
that it actually...

776
01:35:30.147 --> 01:35:33.650
It would be my absolute pleasure and
honor if I could call you my brother.

777
01:35:37.446 --> 01:35:39.448
There is a way for you
to call me brother.

778
01:35:41.992 --> 01:35:44.786
Last night, at dinner, I was…

779
01:35:47.122 --> 01:35:49.458
charmed by your sister.

780
01:35:51.001 --> 01:35:52.002
Is she spoken for?

781
01:35:53.295 --> 01:35:57.716
Sadly, yes. She's to be married to
the Duke of Oldenburg, I'm afraid.

782
01:35:58.425 --> 01:36:01.386
And what of her
younger sister? Anna?

783
01:36:02.137 --> 01:36:03.805
Is there a formal
offer for Anna?

784
01:36:11.688 --> 01:36:14.399
Well, you see, Anna,
she's 15 years old.

785
01:36:15.609 --> 01:36:16.777
That is a detail.

786
01:36:20.197 --> 01:36:24.785
Our friendship is built on our
mutual distrust of England.

787
01:36:25.494 --> 01:36:29.873
When we hold to the Continental
Blockade, we choke them from the trade,

788
01:36:29.957 --> 01:36:32.251
and we fight for our
most sacred rights.

789
01:36:32.334 --> 01:36:34.503
That is what is
important between us.

790
01:36:35.170 --> 01:36:36.171
I just had a thought.

791
01:36:36.839 --> 01:36:38.131
- No.
- No, say it.

792
01:36:38.215 --> 01:36:39.842
- Should I tell you?
- Please.

793
01:36:41.093 --> 01:36:43.846
Imagine an army. 50,000 men.

794
01:36:44.346 --> 01:36:47.599
Russians, Frenchmen,
perhaps even Austrians,

795
01:36:47.683 --> 01:36:50.394
marching by way of
Constantinople into Asia

796
01:36:50.477 --> 01:36:52.145
would have only to
reach the Euphrates

797
01:36:52.229 --> 01:36:54.565
to make England tremble and
bring her down on her knees

798
01:36:54.648 --> 01:36:56.149
before the continent.

799
01:36:59.695 --> 01:37:00.863
It is incredible.

800
01:37:02.072 --> 01:37:03.073
Toast.

801
01:37:09.913 --> 01:37:11.415
- To you.
- To us.

802
01:37:12.624 --> 01:37:17.546
His Majesty, the Emperor Napoleon,
wishes to make a formal offer to Austria

803
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:19.840
and to His Majesty,
King Francis,

804
01:37:21.049 --> 01:37:24.344
for the hand of the
archduchess, Marie-Louise.

805
01:37:26.013 --> 01:37:27.139
His eldest daughter.

806
01:37:28.473 --> 01:37:29.683
No.

807
01:37:30.976 --> 01:37:33.520
This union would bring
together Austria and France

808
01:37:33.604 --> 01:37:35.731
in an unbreakable
matrimonial bond.

809
01:37:37.524 --> 01:37:39.526
Is this a joke?

810
01:37:41.904 --> 01:37:47.904
I may find it humorous…
but His Majesty does not.

811
01:38:06.553 --> 01:38:08.222
Did you have a pleasant journey?

812
01:38:08.305 --> 01:38:09.848
It was wonderful. Thank you.

813
01:38:16.021 --> 01:38:17.439
You're quite petite.

814
01:38:18.482 --> 01:38:19.691
I'm not accustomed to that.

815
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:24.863
How do I look to you?

816
01:38:26.490 --> 01:38:28.242
Do I resemble my portrait?

817
01:38:28.825 --> 01:38:33.163
Oh, yes. And even more
handsome and strong.

818
01:38:34.456 --> 01:38:37.960
And you are even more
handsome, more beautiful.

819
01:38:40.128 --> 01:38:42.005
I hope you're pleased
with your choice.

820
01:38:43.674 --> 01:38:46.844
I hope so too. Would you
like to see the bedroom?

821
01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:49.221
Yes, thank you.

822
01:39:01.692 --> 01:39:03.819
Your Majesty, your son.

823
01:39:23.297 --> 01:39:24.298
Hello.

824
01:39:28.635 --> 01:39:29.636
Fire!

825
01:39:38.187 --> 01:39:39.396
My little king.

826
01:39:52.743 --> 01:39:53.869
Hold.

827
01:40:52.219 --> 01:40:53.971
Oh, sweet child.

828
01:41:04.523 --> 01:41:10.195
One day, you will understand
what I have sacrificed for you.

829
01:41:20.205 --> 01:41:23.083
My dear Joséphine,
I'm sad today.

830
01:41:23.625 --> 01:41:27.462
Tsar Alexander has turned against
me and forced me to invade Russia.

831
01:41:28.422 --> 01:41:33.260
He's decided to open his ports to
England while taxing the French.

832
01:41:34.595 --> 01:41:38.390
I must wipe away my melancholy
and begin the march to Moscow.

833
01:41:39.433 --> 01:41:42.311
I've convinced the heads of
Europe of this resolution,

834
01:41:42.394 --> 01:41:46.899
and so I command the combined
forces of France, Austria, Italy,

835
01:41:46.982 --> 01:41:48.692
Germany and Poland.

836
01:41:49.276 --> 01:41:51.945
I see nothing but
success in my future.

837
01:41:52.029 --> 01:41:54.907
Keep your lines. Steady.

838
01:41:57.242 --> 01:41:58.911
To the front.

839
01:41:58.994 --> 01:42:00.913
Keep your step.

840
01:42:07.503 --> 01:42:08.420
Take cover!

841
01:42:08.504 --> 01:42:09.504
Get down!

842
01:42:15.802 --> 01:42:17.596
Get down!

843
01:42:30.859 --> 01:42:32.903
After them!

844
01:42:51.255 --> 01:42:52.506
Whoa.

845
01:42:56.218 --> 01:42:57.219
Whoa.

846
01:43:14.111 --> 01:43:17.781
- Get back! Drop back. Retreat.
- Fall back!

847
01:44:25.182 --> 01:44:27.100
My dear Joséphine.

848
01:44:28.685 --> 01:44:31.939
I'm writing to you because I have
just won a great battle today.

849
01:44:33.565 --> 01:44:35.859
Tomorrow we will
resume our advance.

850
01:44:36.568 --> 01:44:38.946
Moscow is now only
200 miles away.

851
01:44:39.029 --> 01:44:42.491
And I think of you all
the while. All yours.

852
01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.035
Nearly there.

853
01:44:52.459 --> 01:44:53.460
Thank you, sir.

854
01:45:00.551 --> 01:45:03.470
- Thank you, Admiral.
- You were the brave of Austerlitz.

855
01:46:08.493 --> 01:46:10.037
Where are you?

856
01:46:23.133 --> 01:46:25.427
300,000 souls
lived in this city.

857
01:46:27.304 --> 01:46:28.680
And they've all just left?

858
01:46:47.866 --> 01:46:50.786
Little boy.

859
01:46:55.999 --> 01:46:57.543
Where are you?

860
01:47:02.005 --> 01:47:03.632
Don't be frightened.

861
01:47:04.466 --> 01:47:06.677
I'm just gonna give
you a little spanking.

862
01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:39.042
It's not very sporting, is it?

863
01:47:40.919 --> 01:47:42.796
For his honor and
Russia's, not mine.

864
01:47:48.218 --> 01:47:50.179
There's dignity to
be had in defeat.

865
01:48:33.847 --> 01:48:34.848
Who did this?

866
01:48:36.266 --> 01:48:37.267
They did.

867
01:48:38.769 --> 01:48:41.980
No, they did not. Be sensible.

868
01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:46.276
Who set these fires?

869
01:48:48.111 --> 01:48:51.532
Your Majesty, they did.

870
01:48:57.162 --> 01:49:00.123
He'd rather burn his own
city than negotiate with me.

871
01:49:00.916 --> 01:49:02.960
I didn't think he
had the courage.

872
01:49:08.423 --> 01:49:13.971
Well, we'll go to Saint Petersburg
and have him burn that too.

873
01:49:15.848 --> 01:49:19.393
We have let too
much time slip away.

874
01:49:21.103 --> 01:49:24.481
We would be marching
into the Russian winter

875
01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.486
with horses that are not
raised for this weather.

876
01:49:31.029 --> 01:49:34.283
If we go back to Poland, we
can wait out the winter months.

877
01:49:49.798 --> 01:49:53.302
Napoleon, your letters are
a soothing balm to my heart.

878
01:49:54.219 --> 01:49:55.512
I fear for you.

879
01:49:56.263 --> 01:49:59.975
Remember that I alone know
your health, your fears.

880
01:50:00.767 --> 01:50:04.313
I thank you as tenderly
as I will always love you.

881
01:50:04.855 --> 01:50:05.898
Joséphine.

882
01:50:07.566 --> 01:50:09.151
My friend, Joséphine.

883
01:50:10.319 --> 01:50:11.486
"Friend."

884
01:50:12.571 --> 01:50:14.740
It is strange to write
that word to you.

885
01:50:15.991 --> 01:50:17.993
You have always
been so much more.

886
01:50:26.084 --> 01:50:30.881
Despite careful organization, there
have been breakdowns in supply.

887
01:50:32.466 --> 01:50:37.262
We're suffering sickness,
desertion and famine.

888
01:50:39.306 --> 01:50:40.432
We are winning.

889
01:50:52.653 --> 01:50:55.989
- Us or Cossacks?
- Us.

890
01:50:59.201 --> 01:51:03.830
Joséphine. Fortune
has abandoned me.

891
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.709
I know that it is
what fate has for me.

892
01:51:08.418 --> 01:51:10.587
Your words rattle in my head.

893
01:51:12.256 --> 01:51:14.258
I am nothing without you.

894
01:51:18.595 --> 01:51:24.595
Of the 600,000 men you sent to
Russia, only 40,000 have returned.

895
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:30.941
Therefore, you have been
exiled in no uncertain terms.

896
01:51:32.734 --> 01:51:37.698
The allied coalition of Austria,
Prussia, Russia and England,

897
01:51:39.491 --> 01:51:41.785
and with the agreement
of the French Council,

898
01:51:42.995 --> 01:51:46.748
grant you sovereignty
of the island of Elba.

899
01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:51.587
A revenue of two million
francs from the French funds,

900
01:51:52.588 --> 01:51:56.008
pensions for the Bonaparte family
and the Empress Marie-Louise.

901
01:51:57.176 --> 01:52:02.389
It also provides for Empress Joséphine
to retain all of her properties

902
01:52:03.891 --> 01:52:07.728
and an allotted annual
income of one million francs.

903
01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:38.425
I love France too much.

904
01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.933
All I've desired was its glory.

905
01:52:48.727 --> 01:52:50.687
I would never bring
her misfortune.

906
01:52:53.190 --> 01:52:54.775
They want me to abdicate.

907
01:52:56.485 --> 01:52:58.028
Fine, I'll abdicate.

908
01:54:04.845 --> 01:54:05.846
Your Highness.

909
01:54:07.598 --> 01:54:08.599
Empress.

910
01:54:23.655 --> 01:54:24.656
Here.

911
01:54:29.536 --> 01:54:31.288
Joséphine, Joséphine.

912
01:54:33.415 --> 01:54:34.416
I am charmed.

913
01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:37.503
But…

914
01:54:42.049 --> 01:54:46.303
you do not have to lock yourself
away just because he's not here.

915
01:54:48.055 --> 01:54:50.432
I know what it is like
to be underestimated.

916
01:54:52.059 --> 01:54:58.059
But your eyes, your
charm and your spirit,

917
01:54:59.274 --> 01:55:00.484
it is in there.

918
01:55:01.318 --> 01:55:04.863
It is yours, and you can use it.

919
01:55:48.907 --> 01:55:50.242
Dear Joséphine,

920
01:55:50.993 --> 01:55:54.079
You are mine. You
will always be.

921
01:55:55.622 --> 01:55:57.624
I cannot stand it any longer.

922
01:55:58.250 --> 01:56:00.502
It has been 300
days on this rock,

923
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:04.548
and I'm ready to come home
and reclaim what's mine:

924
01:56:05.174 --> 01:56:06.967
you and France.

925
01:56:25.152 --> 01:56:26.904
I'm taking your ship.

926
01:56:26.987 --> 01:56:29.865
If you do not provoke me,
you do not have to fear me.

927
01:56:48.926 --> 01:56:50.135
Napoleon,

928
01:56:51.094 --> 01:56:55.307
I'm a flower that opens its
petals and smiles to the sunshine,

929
01:56:56.433 --> 01:56:59.937
unconscious that the storm
is near which will lay me low

930
01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:02.189
and scatter leaves
to the heavens.

931
01:57:03.190 --> 01:57:05.192
Come quickly, my friend.

932
01:57:34.847 --> 01:57:37.182
If you would open
your mouth, please.

933
01:57:42.437 --> 01:57:43.438
Thank you.

934
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:49.570
Thank you.

935
01:57:50.362 --> 01:57:53.699
Well, your chest is congested.
Your throat is aflame.

936
01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:56.702
My suggestion is to stay in bed.

937
01:57:59.204 --> 01:58:00.497
But Napoleon is coming.

938
01:58:01.039 --> 01:58:03.792
It would be unwise to
receive any visitors.

939
01:58:03.876 --> 01:58:05.502
But Napoleon is coming.

940
01:58:05.586 --> 01:58:06.670
I understand.

941
01:58:26.231 --> 01:58:28.192
Just keep her comfortable.

942
01:58:48.003 --> 01:58:49.046
Whoa!

943
01:58:56.094 --> 01:58:57.179
Your Majesty.

944
01:59:02.017 --> 01:59:03.310
You may speak.

945
01:59:03.393 --> 01:59:06.563
Bonaparte, Your Majesty.
He has returned.

946
01:59:06.647 --> 01:59:08.690
A ship landed on a beach
in Antibes this morning,

947
01:59:08.774 --> 01:59:09.650
and they're on the march.

948
01:59:09.733 --> 01:59:12.778
Napoleon Bonaparte is
marching towards Paris.

949
01:59:16.156 --> 01:59:17.449
More.

950
01:59:17.533 --> 01:59:18.534
Your Majesty.

951
01:59:51.942 --> 01:59:52.942
Afternoon, Colonel.

952
01:59:53.861 --> 01:59:55.070
Your Majesty.

953
01:59:55.654 --> 01:59:56.738
General Marchand,

954
01:59:56.822 --> 01:59:59.408
in defense of the royal
government of King Louis XVIII,

955
02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:03.245
requests that you surrender your
weapons and cease your march

956
02:00:03.954 --> 02:00:06.623
so that you may be arrested
and returned to your island.

957
02:00:07.666 --> 02:00:11.545
Will you please inform the general that
I shall like to come and speak with him?

958
02:00:13.255 --> 02:00:15.257
I have no fight with
my own Fifth Army.

959
02:00:17.050 --> 02:00:18.051
Sir.

960
02:00:27.102 --> 02:00:28.562
He wishes to speak.

961
02:00:30.063 --> 02:00:31.064
Make ready!

962
02:00:34.818 --> 02:00:36.028
Present.

963
02:00:47.039 --> 02:00:52.002
Soldiers of the Fifth
Regiment, do you recognize me?

964
02:00:55.797 --> 02:00:57.925
Do you recognize me, soldiers?

965
02:00:59.843 --> 02:01:01.428
Yes, Emperor!

966
02:01:07.643 --> 02:01:08.852
I miss you.

967
02:01:11.605 --> 02:01:13.607
I'm melancholy for my home…

968
02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:18.070
and for our victories together.

969
02:01:21.281 --> 02:01:22.783
I want to come home.

970
02:01:24.243 --> 02:01:25.536
Will you join me?

971
02:01:27.287 --> 02:01:29.039
Long live the emperor!

972
02:01:29.122 --> 02:01:32.334
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

973
02:01:32.417 --> 02:01:36.547
- Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

974
02:02:16.545 --> 02:02:21.466
On May 26th,
Dr. Corvisart was called

975
02:02:22.759 --> 02:02:27.931
and found her chest congested
and her throat inflamed.

976
02:02:30.309 --> 02:02:32.811
Her illness was diphtheria.

977
02:02:35.898 --> 02:02:41.778
On May 29th, last sacrament
was given, and she died.

978
02:02:46.408 --> 02:02:48.285
And no one thought to notify me?

979
02:02:58.587 --> 02:02:59.588
Hortense.

980
02:03:02.508 --> 02:03:03.509
Do you blame...

981
02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:06.553
Do you blame me?

982
02:03:09.306 --> 02:03:10.390
I don't blame you.

983
02:03:10.474 --> 02:03:11.475
Of course not.

984
02:03:14.353 --> 02:03:17.731
I'm not to bear the
burden of responsibility

985
02:03:19.316 --> 02:03:21.235
for the misfortunes
of your mother.

986
02:03:22.361 --> 02:03:24.446
I want the letters
that I wrote to her.

987
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:28.575
I'm sorry, I don't have them.
They were stolen by her valet.

988
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:32.579
Where did she keep them?

989
02:03:34.957 --> 02:03:37.459
In the cupboard in her
bedroom, next to her bed.

990
02:03:41.088 --> 02:03:42.506
What did he do with them?

991
02:03:44.925 --> 02:03:46.510
Her valet sold them.

992
02:03:53.892 --> 02:03:54.893
I'm sorry.

993
02:03:57.855 --> 02:03:58.856
I forgive you.

994
02:04:03.652 --> 02:04:06.780
Napoleon Bonaparte has destroyed

995
02:04:06.864 --> 02:04:10.742
the only title upon which
his very existence depended.

996
02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:15.497
This congregation
of allies shall form

997
02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:19.042
along the borders of
France and Belgium an army.

998
02:04:19.126 --> 02:04:21.795
70,000 troops from England,

999
02:04:23.130 --> 02:04:25.716
120,000 troops from Prussia.

1000
02:04:27.801 --> 02:04:31.763
This vermin has routed
the farmyards of Europe

1001
02:04:32.639 --> 02:04:34.808
while the farmers snored.

1002
02:04:35.392 --> 02:04:37.603
We should have struck
this blow long ago.

1003
02:04:38.687 --> 02:04:43.025
He has held the world
hostage with his egotism,

1004
02:04:43.108 --> 02:04:46.320
his insatiable hunger for power,

1005
02:04:46.403 --> 02:04:49.823
and his lack of
simple good manners.

1006
02:04:50.782 --> 02:04:53.243
We will all sleep
again without him.

1007
02:04:54.411 --> 02:04:59.541
I believe I speak for all of us when I
say that the only regret we all share

1008
02:05:00.250 --> 02:05:03.670
is that we allowed this
vermin to live at all.

1009
02:05:04.838 --> 02:05:08.467
250,000 men with the traitor.

1010
02:05:09.676 --> 02:05:15.641
25,000 men, 125,000 men

1011
02:05:15.724 --> 02:05:18.393
and 100,000 men…

1012
02:05:21.897 --> 02:05:25.234
against our 125,000 men.

1013
02:05:27.694 --> 02:05:29.279
This is a fight on land.

1014
02:05:30.948 --> 02:05:33.951
This is what Britain does not
know how to do that I know.

1015
02:05:36.245 --> 02:05:40.332
Strike quickly against
Wellington and Blücher.

1016
02:05:41.124 --> 02:05:42.709
Defeat them separately.

1017
02:05:43.752 --> 02:05:47.172
Disallow them from
uniting forces here.

1018
02:06:00.227 --> 02:06:01.436
Morning.

1019
02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:02.521
Morning.

1020
02:06:03.605 --> 02:06:05.065
The Prussians are advancing.

1021
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:07.651
We should begin the offensive.

1022
02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.445
We must wait for
the ground to dry.

1023
02:06:12.948 --> 02:06:16.243
Blücher will never make it in time.
I'll have Wellington by lunch.

1024
02:06:39.057 --> 02:06:41.852
I never get wet
if I can help it.

1025
02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.336
What shall I tell the men?

1026
02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:53.090
Tell them to make the rain stop.

1027
02:07:56.093 --> 02:08:00.430
- Coming through!
- In formation!

1028
02:08:01.890 --> 02:08:04.560
Now's your time,
lads. Now's your time.

1029
02:08:05.894 --> 02:08:07.521
Now, listen very carefully.

1030
02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:13.902
Patience is the order of the day
today. Patience shall win the day.

1031
02:08:14.653 --> 02:08:16.905
We must hold this ground.

1032
02:08:17.614 --> 02:08:19.408
Let them come to us.

1033
02:08:19.491 --> 02:08:21.326
Huzzah!

1034
02:08:26.665 --> 02:08:27.916
Go on, boys. Go on.

1035
02:08:30.085 --> 02:08:31.086
Whoa.

1036
02:08:31.879 --> 02:08:33.088
Good morning, General Blücher.

1037
02:08:33.172 --> 02:08:35.799
- Good morning.
- Estimated time of arrival, sir?

1038
02:08:35.883 --> 02:08:38.218
- Officer?
- About five hours.

1039
02:08:38.302 --> 02:08:39.887
About five hours.

1040
02:08:56.445 --> 02:08:57.821
Come on, boys.

1041
02:09:10.667 --> 02:09:11.668
There he is.

1042
02:09:12.586 --> 02:09:18.258
He appears to be just sleeping.

1043
02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:25.140
One thing you cannot resist,
my friend, is a frontal attack.

1044
02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:31.063
Let's see how this general
can attack our position.

1045
02:09:34.066 --> 02:09:38.904
Sir. I have the emperor in my
sights. Do I have permission to fire?

1046
02:09:38.987 --> 02:09:40.113
Certainly not.

1047
02:09:40.614 --> 02:09:42.967
Generals commanding armies have
better things to do with their time

1048
02:09:42.991 --> 02:09:44.093
than to shoot at one another.

1049
02:09:44.117 --> 02:09:46.578
Hold your fire, rifleman,
on pain of death.

1050
02:09:46.662 --> 02:09:48.455
Go on, boys. Come.

1051
02:09:48.539 --> 02:09:50.332
A runner coming through!

1052
02:09:51.834 --> 02:09:53.502
Blücher, 11 to 12 miles, sir.

1053
02:09:54.336 --> 02:09:56.171
Attention, follow me.

1054
02:09:56.672 --> 02:09:59.216
- Blücher at 11 to 12 miles, sir.
- Jesus Christ.

1055
02:09:59.299 --> 02:10:01.385
- I want a report every hour.
- Yes, sir.

1056
02:10:04.179 --> 02:10:07.850
Runner coming through. Make way.

1057
02:10:12.437 --> 02:10:15.357
Prussians on the
roadside, 12 miles.

1058
02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:25.492
Prussian troops have been sighted
on the road, sire. Twelve miles.

1059
02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:30.330
Ready the cannons.

1060
02:10:33.959 --> 02:10:35.627
Ready the cannons!

1061
02:10:38.797 --> 02:10:40.841
Go on! Move!

1062
02:10:50.267 --> 02:10:52.853
Ready! Cannons are ready!

1063
02:10:52.936 --> 02:10:54.813
Cannons are ready!

1064
02:10:54.897 --> 02:10:56.607
The rain has stopped, sir.

1065
02:11:05.532 --> 02:11:07.242
Prepare to fire!

1066
02:11:16.877 --> 02:11:19.463
- Fire!
- Fire!

1067
02:11:25.469 --> 02:11:27.012
Take cover!

1068
02:11:29.806 --> 02:11:32.142
Straight into position. Steady.

1069
02:11:32.226 --> 02:11:36.313
Prepare for the
advance. Get ready.

1070
02:11:37.648 --> 02:11:39.107
Prepare for the advance.

1071
02:11:39.191 --> 02:11:41.276
Readjust to 195!

1072
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.403
Adjust 195!

1073
02:11:43.487 --> 02:11:46.156
Elevation 195.

1074
02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:50.327
Adjusted!

1075
02:11:52.287 --> 02:11:55.165
Prepare to fire! Fire!

1076
02:11:55.249 --> 02:11:56.792
Fire!

1077
02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:05.008
Keep your head down.
Seventh, take over.

1078
02:12:13.892 --> 02:12:16.770
- Out the way!
- Hold fast, men!

1079
02:12:20.816 --> 02:12:24.319
Infantry, advance!

1080
02:12:25.153 --> 02:12:26.780
Left company!

1081
02:12:29.157 --> 02:12:30.701
And march!

1082
02:12:30.784 --> 02:12:32.870
Get in formation. Now!

1083
02:12:34.872 --> 02:12:35.998
Keep to the line!

1084
02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:38.250
Join!

1085
02:12:47.634 --> 02:12:51.722
Second wave, advance!
Over the top, men!

1086
02:12:52.723 --> 02:12:54.141
Hold the line!

1087
02:12:54.224 --> 02:12:56.185
Cannons!

1088
02:12:56.894 --> 02:12:58.687
Fire!

1089
02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:03.650
Get ready.

1090
02:13:04.735 --> 02:13:05.986
Hold fast.

1091
02:13:06.778 --> 02:13:08.197
Fire!

1092
02:13:17.539 --> 02:13:19.666
You there, get on that cannon.

1093
02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:30.844
Fire!

1094
02:13:37.726 --> 02:13:39.520
Fill the gap!

1095
02:13:41.355 --> 02:13:42.773
Keep the line!

1096
02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.908
Skirmishers, keep advancing!

1097
02:13:52.991 --> 02:13:54.326
Get in formation.

1098
02:13:54.409 --> 02:13:56.161
Fire at will.

1099
02:14:01.458 --> 02:14:03.794
Keep them back, men. Fire.

1100
02:14:06.964 --> 02:14:10.133
Go on. Don't let them rally!

1101
02:14:15.889 --> 02:14:17.099
…the strike position.

1102
02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:19.643
Get up, boys. Go
on. Go on, boys.

1103
02:14:21.228 --> 02:14:22.563
Whoa.

1104
02:14:25.107 --> 02:14:28.026
Prussians, roadside, five miles.

1105
02:14:29.736 --> 02:14:31.363
Five miles, maybe less.

1106
02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:35.033
We have to act before
Blücher arrives.

1107
02:14:35.701 --> 02:14:36.702
Out.

1108
02:14:39.538 --> 02:14:40.539
Out!

1109
02:14:52.801 --> 02:14:54.219
Cavalry!

1110
02:14:55.512 --> 02:14:57.306
Charge!

1111
02:15:04.313 --> 02:15:05.814
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1112
02:15:05.898 --> 02:15:08.358
Prepare to receive cavalry.

1113
02:15:17.034 --> 02:15:21.413
We must hold our ground.
Stand fast to the last man.

1114
02:15:21.496 --> 02:15:23.749
We must not be beat!

1115
02:15:24.541 --> 02:15:26.793
Or what will they
say in England?

1116
02:15:26.877 --> 02:15:30.047
- Hold the line.
- Keep it tight.

1117
02:15:34.384 --> 02:15:37.888
Steady, men. Stay in formation.

1118
02:15:41.308 --> 02:15:43.685
Long live the emperor!

1119
02:15:46.021 --> 02:15:47.940
Company, halt!

1120
02:15:48.607 --> 02:15:51.985
Form square!

1121
02:16:07.626 --> 02:16:10.212
Long live the emperor!

1122
02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:16.969
One section, fire.
Two section, fire.

1123
02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:36.280
What do we do, sir? We
can't break through.

1124
02:16:36.362 --> 02:16:38.824
Keep them running. Get
in back with the square.

1125
02:16:41.535 --> 02:16:43.120
Show them your British steel.

1126
02:16:54.798 --> 02:16:56.758
Present arms!

1127
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:01.805
Shoulder, hold!

1128
02:17:06.393 --> 02:17:08.145
They're here, the Prussians.

1129
02:17:11.522 --> 02:17:12.900
First over the rise, Emperor.

1130
02:17:38.925 --> 02:17:41.011
We need to find a way through!

1131
02:17:43.847 --> 02:17:45.849
Break the square!

1132
02:17:56.485 --> 02:17:57.778
Charge bayonets.

1133
02:17:58.654 --> 02:18:00.489
Charge bayonets!

1134
02:18:02.574 --> 02:18:07.120
Your Emperor is with you. You
are the brave of Austerlitz.

1135
02:18:07.995 --> 02:18:09.540
Never surrender.

1136
02:18:10.374 --> 02:18:12.876
For homeland and glory!

1137
02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:22.511
Shoulder to
shoulder! Form lines!

1138
02:18:22.593 --> 02:18:24.263
Shoulder to shoulder.

1139
02:18:31.227 --> 02:18:32.521
Infantry, advance.

1140
02:18:33.021 --> 02:18:34.690
Battalion!

1141
02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:38.861
Advance!

1142
02:18:44.532 --> 02:18:45.909
Keep the line!

1143
02:18:48.202 --> 02:18:50.414
Footmen, fire!

1144
02:18:54.334 --> 02:18:56.420
Second line, fire.

1145
02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:01.717
Prepare to charge!

1146
02:19:04.136 --> 02:19:05.512
Charge!

1147
02:19:12.352 --> 02:19:14.062
Go on! Batter them!

1148
02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:18.650
Advance!

1149
02:19:30.913 --> 02:19:32.121
Cavalry advance, sir?

1150
02:19:33.373 --> 02:19:34.665
Cavalry advance.

1151
02:19:35.250 --> 02:19:37.669
Prepare for counterattack.

1152
02:19:37.753 --> 02:19:42.508
Men, enter. Full support.

1153
02:20:17.459 --> 02:20:21.255
No. He can't help himself.

1154
02:20:22.506 --> 02:20:24.216
Sir, Blücher.

1155
02:20:30.931 --> 02:20:31.932
Thank God.

1156
02:20:32.432 --> 02:20:37.396
Your Majesty!

1157
02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:41.608
Come see how masse
de la France dines!

1158
02:20:41.692 --> 02:20:42.692
Yeah!

1159
02:21:10.470 --> 02:21:12.764
Yeah!

1160
02:21:47.216 --> 02:21:51.678
The battle is mine. There
will be an end to the war.

1161
02:21:59.311 --> 02:22:01.146
Senior officer, on deck!

1162
02:22:03.690 --> 02:22:05.567
Good day.

1163
02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:14.201
I am the first to admit when I
make a mistake. But I never do.

1164
02:22:14.284 --> 02:22:16.119
Because it is geometry.

1165
02:22:17.579 --> 02:22:19.957
I simply know precisely
where to place a cannon.

1166
02:22:21.500 --> 02:22:26.213
But tragically I cannot transfer
this knowledge to my marshals.

1167
02:22:27.297 --> 02:22:30.509
That might be what is
most difficult in life.

1168
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:34.137
Accepting the
failures of others.

1169
02:22:35.222 --> 02:22:36.473
You must not do that.

1170
02:22:38.934 --> 02:22:40.269
Encourage greatness.

1171
02:22:45.607 --> 02:22:46.733
Mind your head, sir.

1172
02:22:49.653 --> 02:22:51.405
Mind your head, sir.

1173
02:22:58.537 --> 02:23:01.623
- What are they doing there?
- Sir, it's the midshipmen. They adore him.

1174
02:23:01.707 --> 02:23:02.791
Well, get 'em out.

1175
02:23:02.875 --> 02:23:04.793
Clear the room. Quickly.

1176
02:23:21.185 --> 02:23:23.228
- Your grace...
- Good morning, General.

1177
02:23:23.312 --> 02:23:24.605
These boys are delightful.

1178
02:23:26.523 --> 02:23:27.816
May I sit down?

1179
02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:28.901
Please.

1180
02:23:30.194 --> 02:23:31.486
And this breakfast.

1181
02:23:32.487 --> 02:23:36.867
Now I know why you have such
a successful navy. Thank you.

1182
02:23:42.748 --> 02:23:45.125
I've never visited the
English countryside.

1183
02:23:45.209 --> 02:23:47.085
I imagine I'll
love the Cotswolds…

1184
02:23:50.547 --> 02:23:53.634
soft flowing hills,
gentle light.

1185
02:23:55.594 --> 02:23:59.973
My dear sir, it is only by
a narrow margin of opinion

1186
02:24:00.057 --> 02:24:02.267
that you have been spared
the fate of being shot.

1187
02:24:04.019 --> 02:24:06.271
Politically, I'm
afraid it's impossible

1188
02:24:06.355 --> 02:24:09.775
for the British government to
allow you to stay in England.

1189
02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:14.905
You are permitted three
officers and 12 servants

1190
02:24:14.988 --> 02:24:17.199
to accompany you into exile.

1191
02:24:18.033 --> 02:24:21.703
Exile will be contained to
the island of Saint Helena

1192
02:24:21.787 --> 02:24:26.375
under the watchful eye of Governor
Hudson Lowe and his family.

1193
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:29.711
Saint…

1194
02:24:30.921 --> 02:24:34.341
Helena. It's a small island.

1195
02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:36.802
More of a rock, really.

1196
02:24:37.845 --> 02:24:40.597
A thousand miles from
the mainland of Africa.

1197
02:24:41.348 --> 02:24:45.853
I'm told it's very pretty, tranquil.
You'll have time to reflect.

1198
02:24:47.563 --> 02:24:49.731
Your correspondence
will be monitored,

1199
02:24:49.815 --> 02:24:53.360
your presence verified twice
daily by the orderly officer.

1200
02:25:03.620 --> 02:25:06.874
Fix that rigging line.
Draw up the sails.

1201
02:25:08.458 --> 02:25:09.793
Go below deck!

1202
02:25:18.927 --> 02:25:23.265
What will you do now? I
hate to see you alone.

1203
02:25:24.641 --> 02:25:29.438
Will you come to me?
Will I forgive you?

1204
02:25:31.106 --> 02:25:33.525
My sweet, stubborn Emperor.

1205
02:25:34.610 --> 02:25:37.196
I let you loose and
let you come to ruin.

1206
02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:41.742
Next time, I will be Emperor,

1207
02:25:41.825 --> 02:25:43.744
and you will do as I say.

1208
02:25:51.001 --> 02:25:53.712
Well, you were right.

1209
02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:57.674
Every night I beg to
see you in my dreams.

1210
02:25:58.592 --> 02:26:01.887
And when I do, you turn me away.

1211
02:26:34.336 --> 02:26:36.296
Girls, what's the
capital of France?

1212
02:26:38.841 --> 02:26:39.842
Paris.

1213
02:26:40.551 --> 02:26:41.552
And Russia?

1214
02:26:42.261 --> 02:26:44.513
Petersburg. And Moscow before.

1215
02:26:46.473 --> 02:26:50.894
Moscow. And who burnt
Moscow to the ground?

1216
02:26:55.315 --> 02:26:56.316
I don't know, sir.

1217
02:26:57.776 --> 02:26:58.777
I did.

1218
02:26:59.570 --> 02:27:03.407
I believe, sir, the Russians
burnt it to get rid of the French.

1219
02:27:03.907 --> 02:27:04.908
Who told you that?

1220
02:27:05.701 --> 02:27:07.160
It's common knowledge, sir.

1221
02:27:11.248 --> 02:27:13.542
Go. Go play.

1222
02:27:15.127 --> 02:27:16.128
En garde.

1223
02:27:19.423 --> 02:27:22.009
Can I tell you what I
have waiting for you?

1224
02:27:24.178 --> 02:27:28.390
It is a secret. And I will
show you when you arrive.

1225
02:27:31.977 --> 02:27:37.316
Come to me, Napoleon.
And let's try this again.
