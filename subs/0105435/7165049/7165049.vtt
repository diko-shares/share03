1
00:01:44.396 --> 00:01:48.355
46-99402.

2
00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:52.777
Transfer to 53-01138.

3
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:00.280
What'd we just do?

4
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.658
The Republican Party just made a
generous donation to the Black Panthers.

5
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.498
Farm out.
Right arm.

6
00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:08.952
Who's next?
Let's see.

7
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.464
Richard Nixon's personal
checking account is in here.

8
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.291
Ooh, this is a challenge.

9
00:02:15.385 --> 00:02:19.128
Marty, we have to find somebody
truly worthy to give his money to.

10
00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:21.429
How about...

11
00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.803
The National Association
to Legalize Marijuana.

12
00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:25.726
Perfect.
How much should he give?

13
00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:29.806
He's a generous man. I'd say, all he's got.
God, I'm hungry!

14
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.986
Marty, you are sure we will not
get into trouble for this?

15
00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:37.814
Cosmo, trust me.

16
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.287
Posit, the phone company
has too much money.

17
00:02:48.377 --> 00:02:51.039
Oh, good one.
Consequence?

18
00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.460
They're corrupt. Result?

19
00:02:52.547 --> 00:02:55.835
The system perpetuates itself
at the expense of the people.

20
00:02:55.967 --> 00:03:00.177
Conclusion? Ma Bell needs
to donate some money.

21
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.470
We're gonna change the world,
Marty.

22
00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:06.642
I just wish we could get
course credit for this. Gosh!

23
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.436
You gotta eat.
You want some food?

24
00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:11.763
Loser goes.

25
00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:15.067
I never lose.

26
00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:24.031
Pepperoni pizza, please,
shaken, not stirred.

27
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:27.705
Power to the people, Cos.
Power to the people, Marty.

28
00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.749
One cannot trust anybody
these days.

29
00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.501
No, don't do this.

30
00:04:54.795 --> 00:04:57.287
Marty! Marty!

31
00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.046
Marty! Marty!

32
00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:17.560
Martin.

33
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:20.063
Martin.

34
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:26.273
Martin. Martin.

35
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.657
It's time.

36
00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:35.748
How're we doing?

37
00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:39.670
Carl's in position on the fire escape.
Mother's in the cable vault.

38
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:42.919
Whistler, he's reading.

39
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:51.631
We're up.

40
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:55.427
What's with the lobby?
Still just the one guard.

41
00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.557
Okay, Mother, try the ones
coming off the blue trunk.

42
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.237
Nope.

43
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.615
Try the ones coming off the white
trunk, Mother. These don't sound right.

44
00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.157
<i>Oh no.</i>

45
00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:18.700
We've even got photos
of the guy leaving the embassy

46
00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:21.253
through the
back service entrance.

47
00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.793
Hey, Crease, you on?

48
00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:26.670
Yeah, I'm on.

49
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.968
<i>Were you still in CIA in '72?</i>

50
00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.805
Yeah, why?

51
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.737
Did you know the deputy
director of planning

52
00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.430
<i>was</i> clown in Managua, Nicaragua,
the day before the earthquake?

53
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.772
Now, what are you saying? The CIA
caused the Managua earthquake?

54
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.688
Well, I can't prove it, but...

55
00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.029
I can't talk to that guy.

56
00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.450
Hold on, Mother, go back one.

57
00:06:53.997 --> 00:06:55.328
Bingo!!

58
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.031
Securing bridge clips.

59
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:03.667
Preparing
to sever master alarm circuit.

60
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.457
Five, four...

61
00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:10.177
<i>I looked in that box just</i> now.

62
00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:12.588
<i>There wasn't anything there.</i>

63
00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.594
<i>I know how you feel.
Do you?</i>

64
00:07:53.682 --> 00:07:54.888
Nice bank?

65
00:07:54.975 --> 00:07:56.735
You wouldn't believe
what I had to go through

66
00:07:56.768 --> 00:07:58.384
just to get a safe deposit box.

67
00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:34.423
Oh, shit. We're getting
too old for this.

68
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:40.513
<i>Westguard Security-Yeah,</i> I
<i>got</i> a <i>fire at Centurion Bank.</i>

69
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.889
<i>Yeah, we got the alarm.</i>

70
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.098
<i>Are there any secondary indications?
Smoke or flame?</i>

71
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:47.357
No.

72
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:48.809
<i>It's probably a false alarm.</i>

73
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:52.316
We've <i>been getting them in your
area all night-</i> See <i>if it resets.</i>

74
00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.114
Oh man, I don't know.

75
00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:05.329
Sure you know which one to cut?

76
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.128
Yes! The alarm's
always the green one.

77
00:09:09.716 --> 00:09:11.298
Good, Carl.

78
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:13.784
Hey, man, I'm not waiting any longer.
I'm calling the fire...

79
00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:21.388
Oh. It stopped. Sorry.

80
00:09:21.478 --> 00:09:24.061
<i>Hey, no problem. And, son?</i>

81
00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.262
Sir?

82
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.518
Good work.

83
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:29.145
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

84
00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:32.773
All yours, Bish.

85
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.950
So, how much do you want?

86
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:51.998
80,000. 90,000. 100,000.

87
00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:53.548
Okay.

88
00:09:53.635 --> 00:09:57.128
May I ask why you're closing your
account with us today, sir'?

89
00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:01.932
Well, I just had this weird feeling
that my money wasn't safe here anymore.

90
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:25.281
Gentlemen, your communication
lines are vulnerable.

91
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.662
Fire exits need to be monitored.

92
00:10:27.752 --> 00:10:29.993
Your rent-a-cops
are a tad under trained.

93
00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:32.455
Outside of that, everything
seems to be just fine.

94
00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:34.902
You'll be getting our full report
and analysis in a few days.

95
00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:36.837
But first, who's got my check?

96
00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:42.639
So, people hire you
to break into their places

97
00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:46.343
to make sure no one
can break into their places?

98
00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:49.433
It's a living.

99
00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:53.525
Not a very good one.

100
00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:56.102
Thank you.

101
00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.365
Is that him?

102
00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.241
Oh yeah, that's him.

103
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:14.871
Who's got the report
for the bank sneak?

104
00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:17.003
I'm gonna type it up later.

105
00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:18.128
You are?

106
00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:20.990
We haven't paid the typist since
January, so it's either me or Whistler.

107
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.129
Better Whistler.

108
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:24.009
We've got customers.

109
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.636
Shoes?

110
00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.092
Expensive.

111
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:30.057
Look busy, guys-

112
00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:34.641
Mr. Bishop. Dick Gordon.
Hi.

113
00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:36.022
Buddy Wallace.
Hi.

114
00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:37.853
We've heard a lot of
great things about you.

115
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:40.860
They're all true.
Thanks, Carl.

116
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.511
Gentlemen, why don't we go
to the conference room?

117
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.929
You can tell us
how we can help you.

118
00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:45.068
Good.

119
00:11:49.626 --> 00:11:51.412
Okay.
Thank you.

120
00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:55.249
So here...

121
00:11:55.340 --> 00:12:00.050
Before we begin, there's
something we'd like to clear up.

122
00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:04.346
Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-law enforcement types.

123
00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:06.048
But your team, it's...

124
00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:07.883
I know, kind of different.

125
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.093
Yes, you are.

126
00:12:14.943 --> 00:12:19.403
Darryl Roskow,
also known as "Mother."

127
00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:22.447
Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

128
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:26.117
Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

129
00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:29.871
Carl Arbogast, age 19.

130
00:12:29.958 --> 00:12:32.871
Caught breaking into the Oakland
City School District computer

131
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.497
to change his grades.

132
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.121
I know. We're the ones
who caught him.

133
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:40.549
Irwin Emery,
also known as "Whistler."

134
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.923
He had some little
problem with the phone company.

135
00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:45.754
Sixty-two counts?

136
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.014
Okay, you want law enforcement?

137
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:51.264
How about Donald Crease? Twenty-two
year veteran of the CIA.

138
00:12:51.354 --> 00:12:55.518
Terminated, 1987.
Why was that?

139
00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.025
I don't know. I think maybe
a personality conflict.

140
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.104
Who are you guys?

141
00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.436
Relax, Marty. We have to
check on these things.

142
00:13:01.531 --> 00:13:04.614
It's just everybody on your team has had
some sort of problem in their past.

143
00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.534
And then there's Martin Bishop.

144
00:13:10.832 --> 00:13:12.698
He doesn't seem to have a past.

145
00:13:16.045 --> 00:13:18.958
Sorry to waste your time, gentlemen.
I don't work for the government.

146
00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:20.379
We know.

147
00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.297
National Security Agency.

148
00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:30.052
Oh, you're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

149
00:13:30.143 --> 00:13:34.307
No, that's the FBI. We're not
chartered for domestic surveillance.

150
00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:38.561
Oh, I see. You just overthrow
governments, set up friendly dictators.

151
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.517
No, that's the CIA.

152
00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.291
We protect our government's
communications,

153
00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:44.104
try to break
the other fellow's codes.

154
00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.609
We're the good guys, Marty.

155
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.159
Gee, I can't tell you
what a relief that is, Dick.

156
00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:53.079
All right, that's enough.
Let's go.

157
00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:59.203
If you change your mind
call us at this number...

158
00:14:01.382 --> 00:14:03.089
Mr. Brice.

159
00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.498
Help me out?

160
00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:47.584
Spare a quarter? Help me out. The
government's taken away my home.

161
00:14:47.678 --> 00:14:49.464
Talk 110 him.

162
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.222
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

163
00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:05.819
You know, I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

164
00:15:07.031 --> 00:15:10.695
Hey, hey, we're all friends here, right?
Easy, easy.

165
00:15:10.952 --> 00:15:12.534
Want some coffee or something?

166
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.860
No.

167
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:16.746
Buddy, is that Janek's file?

168
00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.949
Yeah, Janek's file.

169
00:15:19.043 --> 00:15:21.626
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

170
00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:23.919
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

171
00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.340
Specializes in large number
theory, prime numbers, factoring.

172
00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:29.088
Cryptography.
Very good.

173
00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:32.466
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

174
00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.514
Way out of profile
for a guy like that.

175
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.932
It's our job to be curious,
so we traced the money.

176
00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:38.635
Guess where it comes from?

177
00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:41.437
I know you're not gonna say Russia.
Yeah.

178
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.014
Give me a break.

179
00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.421
We won, they lost, you know?
It's been in a couple of papers.

180
00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:47.732
Yeah, we still spy on them.
They still spy on us.

181
00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:50.439
We intercepted a fax
last week. Here.

182
00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.742
They're making some kind of box,
a little black box.

183
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:57.867
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

184
00:15:57.957 --> 00:15:59.977
Security technology...
Sensor techniques, who knows?

185
00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:04.040
It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

186
00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:07.964
Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

187
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.041
Yeah. No way.

188
00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:13.632
Sorry, Marty. We don't
have a lot of choice here.

189
00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:16.308
Do it yourself.

190
00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:17.392
We can't.
Why not?

191
00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:20.080
By law, we're not allowed or equipped
to do this kind of operation.

192
00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:22.345
Then get the FBI.

193
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.522
Yeah, right, the FBI.

194
00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:28.193
The FBI can't work for us without
approval from a congressional committee.

195
00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.236
We don't have the time.
So, why me?

196
00:16:30.323 --> 00:16:31.323
Frankly, because we...

197
00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:32.943
Yeah, frankly.

198
00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.614
Marty, sit down, please.

199
00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:41.744
Frankly, because
it's kind of illegal.

200
00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:43.979
You've managed to stay
underground more than 20 years.

201
00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:45.414
You know how not to get caught.

202
00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.212
We know you can
keep your mouth shut.

203
00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:50.165
Job pays $175,000,
payable on delivery.

204
00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.593
You can distribute it
among the poor, if you like.

205
00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:55.882
Pass.

206
00:16:55.973 --> 00:16:57.338
We also clean up your record.

207
00:16:57.433 --> 00:16:59.233
Quash the outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

208
00:16:59.268 --> 00:17:03.262
Your pal Cosmo got 12 years, and that was
without flight to evade prosecution.

209
00:17:03.356 --> 00:17:06.565
We all know what happened
to him in there.

210
00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.441
If I say no?

211
00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:15.777
Don't say no.

212
00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:19.069
What good would you do
anybody in prison?

213
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.908
I don't believe this. You
lied to us all these years.

214
00:17:25.002 --> 00:17:26.104
Even lied to us about your name.

215
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:27.163
Sorry, okay?

216
00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:29.747
I'm sorry, but when you're
wanted by the feds,

217
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.047
you don't go around
telling everybody.

218
00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:35.422
We're not everybody, Martin. We're
your partners. You tell us.

219
00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:36.844
Fine.

220
00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:40.056
Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

221
00:17:42.937 --> 00:17:45.679
We all have our little
secrets, don't we?

222
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.398
Look, you guys have
a decision to make.

223
00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:53.153
This is not a test. The penetration
is live. The target is unaware.

224
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:56.360
Sneaking a foreign intelligence
service that might kill us

225
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.636
to keep us out
is not what we do.

226
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.901
The probable level of security
is very low.

227
00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:05.582
But if you guys don't want to take that
chance just to keep me out of jail...

228
00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:07.705
Fine. I understand.
Don't do it.

229
00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:13.252
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

230
00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:14.924
I don't care if you go to jail.

231
00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.797
Me neither. I'm in.

232
00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:21.514
Could we maybe just go back to
the "they might kill us" part?

233
00:18:21.601 --> 00:18:23.078
If I thought
that was likely to happen,

234
00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.263
I wouldn't bring this to you.

235
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:25.434
But there is a risk.

236
00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:28.013
It pays $175,000!

237
00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:31.812
I'm in.

238
00:18:36.115 --> 00:18:41.781
You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.
All right. What do we need?

239
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:45.492
Okay. We start with a very light
surveillance. Level three.

240
00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:47.369
First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

241
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.063
Now, this guy's giving a lecture
tomorrow at U.C. in the afternoon.

242
00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:53.330
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

243
00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.293
Okay, let's do it.

244
00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:58.718
For the lecture, you wanna take
Whistler or do you want me?

245
00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:03.302
No, that's okay.
I thought I'd ask Liz.

246
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.051
Who's this?

247
00:19:48.479 --> 00:19:51.141
Sort of an old friend.

248
00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:54.141
Practice! Practice, practice!

249
00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:00.316
Hi.

250
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.316
We're not getting back together.

251
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.196
Did I say anything?
You will.

252
00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.993
I'm here on business, Liz.

253
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.662
Bishop,
you don't have a business.

254
00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.080
You have a club.
It's a boys' club.

255
00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:13.376
You have a little clubhouse. You
probably have a secret handshake.

256
00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.078
Liz, I need your help.

257
00:20:15.172 --> 00:20:18.085
I will not be dragged back
into your world.

258
00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:20.212
I have a new group
of gifted children now,

259
00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:23.294
and I like the fact
that they're under 30.

260
00:20:23.389 --> 00:20:24.424
Excuse me.

261
00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:27.303
There's a mathematician named Gunter Janek.
You know him?

262
00:20:27.393 --> 00:20:29.304
I've read him.
Now go away.

263
00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.136
He's giving a master lecture
at 3:30...

264
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.892
How nice for him.

265
00:20:33.983 --> 00:20:35.439
I thought I'd buy you
dinner after.

266
00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:36.891
I am not going out with you.

267
00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:41.275
This isn't a date, dummy. This is a
scientific exploration, a tutorial.

268
00:20:41.365 --> 00:20:43.197
I need you...

269
00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.818
To explain it to me.

270
00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.656
Read a book.

271
00:20:52.585 --> 00:20:54.326
They found me, Liz.

272
00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.912
The government found me.

273
00:20:59.133 --> 00:21:02.421
They offered me a deal. If I take
their offer, they clear my record,

274
00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.673
and I can get my name back.

275
00:21:15.024 --> 00:21:17.140
You and I
are not getting back together.

276
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.441
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

277
00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:23.522
Pick me up at 3:00.

278
00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.112
Yes!

279
00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:31.120
While the number field sieve is
the best method currently known,

280
00:21:31.207 --> 00:21:37.499
there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

281
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.836
This guy's good.

282
00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:40.924
Shh!

283
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:46.010
Over the rationals and, hence,
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

284
00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:49.384
Using the Artin map, we might
induce homomorphisms...

285
00:21:51.644 --> 00:21:53.760
You seeing anybody?
Shh!

286
00:21:53.854 --> 00:21:57.688
These maps could then be used to combine
splitting information from all the...

287
00:21:57.775 --> 00:22:02.064
This isn't just about large number theory.
It's about cryptography.

288
00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:04.486
Oh? You mean codes?

289
00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:08.741
I mean unbreakable codes.

290
00:22:09.537 --> 00:22:13.451
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions,

291
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:20.129
and allow us to acquire the solution in
a dramatically more efficient manner.

292
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.080
Are you seeing...
Shh!

293
00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:26.008
Such an approach
is purely theoretical.

294
00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:28.632
So far, no one has been able
to accomplish

295
00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:32.966
such constructions yet.

296
00:22:34.645 --> 00:22:37.137
The
numbers are so unbelievably big,

297
00:22:37.231 --> 00:22:40.223
all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

298
00:22:40.317 --> 00:22:44.481
But maybe,
just maybe there's a shortcut.

299
00:22:44.738 --> 00:22:47.446
I'll bet you anything
he's found it.

300
00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:50.992
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

301
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:54.662
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools.

302
00:22:54.748 --> 00:22:57.786
Maybe able to see things in
other numbers that we can't.

303
00:22:57.877 --> 00:22:59.538
Martin.

304
00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:02.829
Martin,
how wonderful to see you.

305
00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:05.290
Hi, Greg. How are you?
Is it not fabulous?

306
00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:09.548
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

307
00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:13.051
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

308
00:23:13.142 --> 00:23:16.430
At least I...
Oh! Goodness, can it be?

309
00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:17.562
Hmm?

310
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:19.720
Oh, yeah.
Elizabeth.

311
00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:21.476
She's dying
to talk to you too, Greg.

312
00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:23.934
Excuse me. Elizabeth.

313
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.728
Elizabeth.

314
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:29.105
Hello, Greg.

315
00:23:29.199 --> 00:23:31.440
Elizabeth and Martin.

316
00:23:31.535 --> 00:23:35.028
My heart leaps like gazelle to
see you back together again.

317
00:23:35.122 --> 00:23:37.534
Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

318
00:23:37.625 --> 00:23:40.083
No? Oh, what a pity.

319
00:23:40.878 --> 00:23:44.917
Wait. I have smashing idea.
Martin! Martin!

320
00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:49.509
Kiev string quartet plays at the
consulate on Thursday night.

321
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:52.675
You will be my guests.

322
00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:54.722
Really, Greg, I wouldn't
know how to repay you.

323
00:23:56.018 --> 00:23:59.761
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends,

324
00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:03.814
perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

325
00:24:03.901 --> 00:24:06.063
Gregor, you are shameless.

326
00:24:06.153 --> 00:24:08.394
See you Thursday night.

327
00:24:08.489 --> 00:24:09.570
What?

328
00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:13.365
New title.
Cultural attaché.

329
00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:16.027
Unbelievable!

330
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:20.456
Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

331
00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:21.873
I'll bet.

332
00:24:24.546 --> 00:24:28.130
I don't care what anybody says
about the "New World Order."

333
00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:30.049
I don't trust that guy.

334
00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:32.593
Who, Greg? He's harmless.

335
00:24:32.763 --> 00:24:34.754
Let the number itself tell us...

336
00:24:40.229 --> 00:24:43.688
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work.

337
00:24:43.774 --> 00:24:46.482
You're gonna follow him,
aren't you?

338
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.477
Liz, I...
It's okay. I'll get a cab.

339
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.528
Can I call you?

340
00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.236
Just be careful.

341
00:25:18.892 --> 00:25:21.179
Janek just got in
the elevator. Going up.

342
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.852
We will be ready for him.

343
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:24.019
How's the audio?

344
00:25:24.106 --> 00:25:26.347
Good.
Mother's pretty close.

345
00:25:26.442 --> 00:25:29.651
He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

346
00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:32.027
What, no parachute?

347
00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:35.607
All righty.
Entry and lights on.

348
00:25:36.285 --> 00:25:37.400
Describe it.

349
00:25:37.786 --> 00:25:39.368
Looks like a workroom.

350
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.446
You got yourself a bench
with a soldering gun,

351
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.498
two spools of wire
and a magnifying lamp.

352
00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:47.168
Yeah, sounds like
he's making something.

353
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.961
Then a desk...

354
00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:51.414
Mmm-hmm.

355
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.134
Telephone, lamp,
answering machine.

356
00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:58.337
Ajar of pencils,
but no little black box.

357
00:25:58.432 --> 00:26:01.265
It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

358
00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:03.638
He's logging on the computer.

359
00:26:07.274 --> 00:26:09.481
Oh, this is good.

360
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:11.229
He's gonna type in his password,

361
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.311
and we're gonna
get a clear shot.

362
00:26:22.998 --> 00:26:25.581
<i>Oh! Dr. Rhyzkov,
good evening.</i>

363
00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:28.371
Hey, let's get an l.D.
on Dr. Rhyzkov.

364
00:26:28.462 --> 00:26:30.123
She was with him this afternoon.

365
00:26:30.214 --> 00:26:33.252
She was trying to tell him
something, and it was making him...

366
00:26:33.342 --> 00:26:35.299
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

367
00:26:35.928 --> 00:26:38.920
<i>Let's do what we did
in Mexico City.</i>

368
00:26:40.516 --> 00:26:42.356
I didn't know you could
do that in Mexico City.

369
00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:43.912
Mr. Bishop,
do you mind if I take a look?

370
00:26:43.936 --> 00:26:45.097
Carl.

371
00:26:45.187 --> 00:26:46.302
Grow up.

372
00:26:50.234 --> 00:26:51.440
Let me see.

373
00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:52.938
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

374
00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:54.898
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

375
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.446
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

376
00:26:58.534 --> 00:27:00.024
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

377
00:27:01.245 --> 00:27:06.365
<i>Elena, really!
I must finish my work.</i>

378
00:27:10.003 --> 00:27:12.495
Okay, back to work.

379
00:27:13.924 --> 00:27:16.962
Nope, here we go. Now we're
gonna get our password.

380
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:20.716
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not call.</i>

381
00:27:20.973 --> 00:27:22.304
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

382
00:27:22.891 --> 00:27:25.599
Get out of the way.
She's in the way.

383
00:27:28.272 --> 00:27:30.764
I don't believe this.

384
00:27:31.108 --> 00:27:33.395
<i>It's just, I have this work.</i>

385
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.904
<i>I give you something
to work, baby.</i>

386
00:27:38.991 --> 00:27:41.528
<i>Okay. Just for
a little while.</i>

387
00:27:47.332 --> 00:27:49.369
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

388
00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:50.494
What's going on?

389
00:27:50.586 --> 00:27:52.042
Oh, nothing.

390
00:27:54.298 --> 00:27:59.418
<i>Elena, really!
I must finish my work.</i>

391
00:28:00.262 --> 00:28:04.551
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not call.</i>

392
00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:06.882
Maybe there's a frame or
two where she doesn't block it.

393
00:28:06.977 --> 00:28:08.638
I'll blow it up.

394
00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:12.263
Hey. Who's Rhyzkov?

395
00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:16.521
Dr. Elena Rhyzkov, visiting
professor from Czechoslovakia,

396
00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:19.775
senior research fellow
in astrophysics.

397
00:28:19.865 --> 00:28:20.865
Bingo.

398
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:24.112
Setec Astronomy,
whatever that is.

399
00:28:25.078 --> 00:28:28.821
<i>I leave message
here on service but you do not call.</i>

400
00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:31.369
There.

401
00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:34.501
W, G...

402
00:28:34.588 --> 00:28:36.329
Looks like the H.

403
00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:38.130
Where do you get H?
Next to the L.

404
00:28:38.217 --> 00:28:39.217
H isn't next to the L.

405
00:28:39.301 --> 00:28:41.042
Guys, do it again.

406
00:28:44.181 --> 00:28:48.425
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not call.</i>

407
00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:53.763
<i>Message here on service
but you do not call.</i>

408
00:28:55.108 --> 00:28:56.974
Okay, that's definitely W, G.

409
00:28:57.069 --> 00:28:59.310
Definitely not.
No, that's a V.

410
00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.894
She's in the way.

411
00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:04.482
Fellows, Janek's little
black box is on his desk

412
00:29:04.826 --> 00:29:07.363
between the pencil jar
and the lamp.

413
00:29:08.914 --> 00:29:12.157
Whistler, I hate to tell you
this, but you're blind.

414
00:29:14.878 --> 00:29:16.744
Play the tape back again.

415
00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:18.454
But you can't even see anything.

416
00:29:18.548 --> 00:29:20.414
Don't look. Listen.

417
00:29:21.802 --> 00:29:23.167
Play it back.

418
00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:27.839
<i>I leave message here on
service but you do not...</i>

419
00:29:27.933 --> 00:29:29.515
He's got a service.

420
00:29:30.686 --> 00:29:33.553
What's he need
an answering machine for?

421
00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:38.600
There's our little black box.

422
00:29:46.535 --> 00:29:50.369
Okay, boss. This
LTX-71 concealable mike

423
00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.055
is part of the same system
that NASA used

424
00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:54.661
when they faked
the Apollo moon landings.

425
00:29:55.377 --> 00:29:58.085
Had the astronauts broadcast
around the world from a soundstage

426
00:29:58.171 --> 00:30:00.458
at Norton Air Force Base
in San Bernardino, California.

427
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:04.463
So, it worked for them. It shouldn't
give us too many problems.

428
00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:06.043
Thanks.

429
00:30:07.806 --> 00:30:09.672
You didn't have a delivery?

430
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:11.006
I should have the invoice here.

431
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:14.472
No delivery is scheduled. They
didn't have anything on record.

432
00:30:15.188 --> 00:30:17.054
Did my wife
drop a cake off for me?

433
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:18.310
There's no cake back here.

434
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.794
Surprise party for Marge
on the second floor.

435
00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:21.087
She was supposed
to drop a cake off.

436
00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:22.727
I don't know about it.

437
00:30:23.947 --> 00:30:25.312
There she is, late as usual.

438
00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:28.991
It states here that I am to
deliver 36 boxes of Liquid Drano

439
00:30:29.077 --> 00:30:30.158
to this address.

440
00:30:30.245 --> 00:30:34.489
I don't care what that <i>says.</i> You're
not on the list. You can't get in.

441
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:35.698
I might lose my job.

442
00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:38.329
That's not my problem.
Now beat it.

443
00:30:38.628 --> 00:30:40.835
I can't reach my card.
Could you buzz this, please?

444
00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:42.412
Just buzz it.
I can't reach my card.

445
00:30:42.507 --> 00:30:43.997
Wait one minute.

446
00:30:44.092 --> 00:30:45.778
We're late for the party
on the second floor.

447
00:30:45.802 --> 00:30:47.634
Push the goddamned buzzer,
will you?

448
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:49.930
Thanks.

449
00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:20.626
Anybody remember how to defeat
an electronic key pad?

450
00:31:22.297 --> 00:31:25.289
Don't even joke about that, Martin.
Those things are impossible.

451
00:31:25.384 --> 00:31:28.126
Think I'm joking? Looks
like they just put it in.

452
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:29.801
Oh boy.

453
00:31:33.475 --> 00:31:34.761
Here, maybe this might help.

454
00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:37.843
Old buddy of mine, was in
Desert Storm, sent it to me.

455
00:31:37.938 --> 00:31:40.179
'Course, he was
on the other side.

456
00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:44.851
<i>Come on, Crease. There's got
to be a way around these things.</i>

457
00:31:44.945 --> 00:31:46.811
All right, all right.

458
00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.491
This might work.

459
00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:57.033
Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.332
Yeah. Right.

461
00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:03.210
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.

462
00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:06.296
Yeah.

463
00:32:07.884 --> 00:32:10.672
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

464
00:32:14.641 --> 00:32:16.097
That worked.

465
00:32:45.046 --> 00:32:46.457
Got it.

466
00:32:46.882 --> 00:32:47.917
Gunter? You're...

467
00:32:48.008 --> 00:32:49.328
Oh, God, no.
Here you go, come on.

468
00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:50.874
Hey, nice to see you.

469
00:32:53.513 --> 00:32:54.513
Who the hell is that?

470
00:32:54.598 --> 00:32:56.384
Battle stations.

471
00:32:56.475 --> 00:32:58.216
Monitor the audio.
Grab the mike.

472
00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.427
Okay.

473
00:33:01.646 --> 00:33:03.762
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, do not scream.

474
00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:06.645
I promise nothing is
going to happen to you.

475
00:33:06.735 --> 00:33:07.816
Okay?

476
00:33:07.903 --> 00:33:09.189
Mmm-hmm.

477
00:33:14.409 --> 00:33:16.195
Who are you?

478
00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:19.912
He's a P.l.

479
00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:21.198
You're a private investigator.

480
00:33:21.249 --> 00:33:23.365
I'm a private investigator.

481
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:26.376
But why? Who hired you?

482
00:33:28.215 --> 00:33:29.215
Huh?

483
00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:30.789
Who hired you?

484
00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:33.254
Mrs. Janek.

485
00:33:34.429 --> 00:33:36.261
There is not Mrs. Janek.

486
00:33:38.642 --> 00:33:40.098
Yeah?

487
00:33:41.478 --> 00:33:42.934
You got us stumped.

488
00:33:44.481 --> 00:33:49.317
Oh yeah? Who do you think paid for
your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

489
00:33:53.782 --> 00:33:55.022
That was good.

490
00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.575
Velma, Velma Janek.

491
00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:01.905
She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings,

492
00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:03.409
vast real estate holdings.

493
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.788
Farms, banks, shopping malls.
Two shopping malls.

494
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:09.732
She supports Gunter but figured
he was cheating on her,

495
00:34:09.756 --> 00:34:11.872
and that's why she hired me.

496
00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:13.799
Bastard liar!

497
00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.170
I'll kill him!
Oh, no, no, no!

498
00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:20.927
No! No, no, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

499
00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:22.803
Get a hold of yourself.

500
00:34:22.936 --> 00:34:25.177
Ha! You gotta not
tell him you know.

501
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.064
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

502
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.232
You don't know anything
about a wife.

503
00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:33.902
You just give me
one good reason why.

504
00:34:35.115 --> 00:34:38.403
All right,
I'll give you a reason.

505
00:34:39.536 --> 00:34:42.494
Give you a really good reason.

506
00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:46.077
It's just what she would
want you to do.

507
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:47.727
It's just what she would
want you to do.

508
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:50.828
It's just what she
wants you to do.

509
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.664
I don't understand.

510
00:34:55.176 --> 00:34:57.759
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

511
00:34:57.846 --> 00:35:00.759
Here, look, I might lose
my license for this.

512
00:35:01.516 --> 00:35:05.100
My client is a vindictive,
bitter woman.

513
00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:08.269
She's been withholding marital
favors from Gunter for years,

514
00:35:08.356 --> 00:35:09.938
and now she's out to ruin him.

515
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.357
And she's
using you to get to her.

516
00:35:12.444 --> 00:35:15.653
And she's using
me to get to you.

517
00:35:17.365 --> 00:35:20.574
I know that's confusing, but don't
you see what's happening here?

518
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.947
You and me, we're just pawns
in this ugly little game.

519
00:35:23.038 --> 00:35:24.119
Pawns.

520
00:35:25.081 --> 00:35:26.788
If you love him...

521
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.457
If you love him...

522
00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:30.204
If you love him...

523
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:36.048
If you really love him...

524
00:35:37.218 --> 00:35:39.550
Then just keep on loving him.

525
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.466
And never let him know

526
00:35:41.556 --> 00:35:45.220
that you know what he thinks
you don't know you know.

527
00:35:45.685 --> 00:35:47.426
You know?

528
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.561
And give him head
whenever he wants.

529
00:35:49.648 --> 00:35:52.185
Give him help.

530
00:35:53.902 --> 00:36:00.399
Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.
Can you do that for Gunter?

531
00:36:02.035 --> 00:36:03.776
Yes, yes, I can, I can.

532
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:05.281
Okay, good.

533
00:36:06.081 --> 00:36:07.913
Now get out of here.

534
00:36:16.174 --> 00:36:17.414
Give him head?

535
00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:19.749
Be a beacon?

536
00:36:22.597 --> 00:36:25.089
<i>Chain, chain, chain
chain, chain, chain</i>

537
00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:29.472
<i>Chain, chain, chain
chain, chain, chain</i>

538
00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:33.351
<i>Chain, chain, chain
chain, chain, chain</i>

539
00:36:33.441 --> 00:36:37.400
<i>Chain of fools</i>

540
00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:41.196
<i>For five long years</i>

541
00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:45.651
<i>I thought you were my man</i>

542
00:36:45.745 --> 00:36:49.113
<i>But I found out</i>

543
00:36:49.207 --> 00:36:53.952
<i>I'm just a link
in your chain, oh</i>

544
00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:56.874
But the key meeting
took place July 1, 1958,

545
00:36:56.965 --> 00:36:59.443
when the Air Force brought this
space visitor to the White House

546
00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:01.707
for an interview with President Eisenhower.
And Ike said,

547
00:37:01.761 --> 00:37:03.377
"Look, give us your technology.

548
00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:05.032
"We'll give you all
the cow lips you want."

549
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:07.923
Don't listen to this man.
He's certifiable.

550
00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:09.995
Your husband knows about cattle
mutilations. He's ex-CIA.

551
00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:11.054
He's touched.

552
00:37:11.146 --> 00:37:13.308
He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

553
00:37:14.149 --> 00:37:15.731
Understood, understood.

554
00:37:15.817 --> 00:37:19.776
One thing I don't quite get
though is you and Cosmo,

555
00:37:19.863 --> 00:37:23.401
you were taking all these
chances, all these big chances,

556
00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:25.361
what for?

557
00:37:26.828 --> 00:37:30.116
We were young.
And there was a war on.

558
00:37:33.001 --> 00:37:35.242
It was a good way to meet girls.

559
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:36.497
I bet.

560
00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:39.834
How come you didn't get caught?

561
00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:45.047
I went out for pizza.

562
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:47.797
Then I went to Canada.

563
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.011
I was lucky. He wasn't.

564
00:37:51.686 --> 00:37:53.723
Did he ever forgive you?

565
00:37:54.314 --> 00:37:55.645
I hope so.

566
00:37:57.317 --> 00:37:58.682
He died in prison.

567
00:38:07.535 --> 00:38:10.869
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

568
00:38:12.207 --> 00:38:13.447
Don?

569
00:38:13.833 --> 00:38:17.417
Well, we have never been
to Europe together.

570
00:38:17.504 --> 00:38:18.504
That's right.

571
00:38:18.588 --> 00:38:20.625
And we are going.

572
00:38:21.674 --> 00:38:23.540
Madrid, Lisbon.

573
00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:25.626
Athens. Oh, and Scotland.

574
00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:26.926
And Tahiti.

575
00:38:27.013 --> 00:38:28.674
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

576
00:38:28.932 --> 00:38:30.218
Mother?

577
00:38:30.725 --> 00:38:33.843
Well, you know, I've never
actually had a really cool car

578
00:38:33.937 --> 00:38:36.429
that I could
fit comfortably into.

579
00:38:36.523 --> 00:38:39.436
So I think
I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago

580
00:38:39.526 --> 00:38:44.066
with a big kitchen,
water bed, big kitchen.

581
00:38:46.032 --> 00:38:47.238
Carl?

582
00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:51.197
I'd like to have a deep
relationship with a beautiful woman

583
00:38:51.287 --> 00:38:54.075
who melts from the very
first time our eyes meet.

584
00:38:55.416 --> 00:38:58.078
We're not
getting paid that much, Carl.

585
00:38:58.628 --> 00:39:00.039
Well, you know,
someone like Liz.

586
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.567
You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

587
00:39:03.591 --> 00:39:04.626
Ooh!
Uh-oh.

588
00:39:04.717 --> 00:39:06.424
<i>HEY. hey, hey, 'new.!</i>

589
00:39:06.636 --> 00:39:08.218
Whistler?

590
00:39:09.806 --> 00:39:12.138
Peace on earth,
goodwill toward men.

591
00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:13.511
MOTHER; Right On.

592
00:39:13.935 --> 00:39:15.266
And women.

593
00:39:15.937 --> 00:39:17.302
Hear, hear!

594
00:39:22.735 --> 00:39:24.567
That's not a word, "scrunchy".

595
00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:26.019
Scrunchy is not a word.

596
00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:27.775
Scrunchy is a word.

597
00:39:27.949 --> 00:39:29.940
Since when? You know what
happens to your face?

598
00:39:30.076 --> 00:39:32.659
Please, it's not a word. Right
now your face is scrunchy.

599
00:39:32.745 --> 00:39:35.737
All right.
We gotta take it as a word.

600
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.212
It's better than "scrunchy."

601
00:39:44.299 --> 00:39:47.462
I didn't invent the word.

602
00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:49.467
Carl.
Yes.

603
00:39:49.929 --> 00:39:52.216
What does it say where this is?

604
00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.468
Hold on a second here.

605
00:39:56.728 --> 00:39:58.844
"System out."

606
00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:05.893
Guys, I really think you
should leave that thing alone.

607
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:11.486
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to
see something. Don't worry, Don.

608
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:14.572
How are they spelling Setec?

609
00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:16.744
S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

610
00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:21.033
Special extraterrestrial?

611
00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:23.209
Earthling counter.

612
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:27.706
Does that make two, four, five.

613
00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:32.337
And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around

614
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:35.889
and looks at me,
like right dead in my eyes.

615
00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:37.181
Setec.

616
00:40:37.518 --> 00:40:38.599
What?

617
00:40:38.686 --> 00:40:40.677
Setec Astronomy.

618
00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:44.640
I just love it
when a man says that to me.

619
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.068
Setec doesn't mean anything.

620
00:40:50.949 --> 00:40:52.860
Excuse me...

621
00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:26.357
Carl, can you get me some cable
and that IO interface, please?

622
00:41:36.077 --> 00:41:37.988
"Monterey's Coast."

623
00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:43.240
Does "Monterey's Coast"
mean anything to you guys?

624
00:41:43.751 --> 00:41:44.832
No.

625
00:41:44.919 --> 00:41:46.409
No.

626
00:41:49.632 --> 00:41:51.339
Here, help me with this.

627
00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.927
Carl, get the diagnostics.

628
00:42:11.112 --> 00:42:13.444
How about "My Socrates Note"?

629
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:16.356
No.

630
00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:17.657
Uh-uh.

631
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.955
No, I...

632
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.290
No. No.

633
00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:45.976
Uh-huh. Got it.
Move to another one.

634
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.823
Mmm-hmm. Give me another one.

635
00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:02.785
Stay in that quadrant.

636
00:43:11.506 --> 00:43:15.090
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

637
00:43:16.677 --> 00:43:17.677
Whoa.

638
00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:21.258
Mother, what was that?
Go back one.

639
00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:22.714
All right.

640
00:43:24.477 --> 00:43:26.343
Holy cow.

641
00:43:27.897 --> 00:43:30.605
What the hell is this?

642
00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:48.118
"Too Many Secrets."

643
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:56.419
Bish, I think you
better come over here.

644
00:43:56.926 --> 00:43:58.917
Carl, got your
little black book?

645
00:43:59.011 --> 00:44:00.046
Yes.

646
00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:03.881
Give me the number for something
impossible to access.

647
00:44:05.893 --> 00:44:07.634
Okay. What about this?

648
00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:10.140
Federal Reserve transfer node,
Culpeper, Virginia.

649
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:11.312
Yeah, sure. Good luck.

650
00:44:11.399 --> 00:44:13.481
Nine hundred billion
a day goes through there.

651
00:44:13.568 --> 00:44:15.605
That'll do. Punch it in.

652
00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:17.561
Okay.

653
00:44:18.698 --> 00:44:21.781
We won't get in.
It's encrypted.

654
00:44:28.249 --> 00:44:29.580
See?

655
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:32.371
Mother, that last contact.

656
00:44:42.013 --> 00:44:43.754
Look at this, boys.

657
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:48.266
Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

658
00:44:49.103 --> 00:44:50.969
Hey, don't screw around
with that thing!

659
00:44:51.063 --> 00:44:52.098
Wait, Crease.

660
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.147
Carl, what else you got?

661
00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:55.598
National power grid?

662
00:44:57.778 --> 00:44:59.610
Okay.

663
00:45:04.535 --> 00:45:06.242
Here we come.

664
00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:08.369
Okay, Mother.

665
00:45:08.456 --> 00:45:09.696
Probing.

666
00:45:13.127 --> 00:45:16.336
Wow. Unbelievable.

667
00:45:18.591 --> 00:45:21.333
Anybody want to
black out New England?

668
00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:23.793
Carl, what else?

669
00:45:23.888 --> 00:45:26.505
Air traffic control system.

670
00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:36.932
Okay, Mother.

671
00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:43.988
Oh, my God.

672
00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:47.241
How is this possible?

673
00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:50.741
Cryptography systems are based on
mathematical problems so complex

674
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.243
they cannot be solved
without a key.

675
00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:56.952
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key,

676
00:45:57.046 --> 00:45:59.583
and he hard-wired it
into that chip.

677
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:00.914
Turn it off.

678
00:46:01.008 --> 00:46:02.919
Want to crash a couple
of passenger jets?

679
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.796
I said turn it off.

680
00:46:04.887 --> 00:46:06.673
Turn it Off.

681
00:46:17.108 --> 00:46:19.224
So it's a code-breaker.

682
00:46:19.527 --> 00:46:23.691
No, it's the code-breaker.

683
00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:28.862
No more secrets.

684
00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:33.367
Honey, you and Melissa
get your things.

685
00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:40.169
Night-night.

686
00:46:40.256 --> 00:46:41.371
Good night.

687
00:46:46.595 --> 00:46:48.506
What time is the hand-off?

688
00:46:49.724 --> 00:46:51.180
9:00 a.m.

689
00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:53.887
Well, between now and then,

690
00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:57.437
we are going to institute
some security around here.

691
00:47:00.985 --> 00:47:05.400
This is where I get off. Nice to
see you again. I'm out of here.

692
00:47:05.948 --> 00:47:12.115
Don't take this personally, Liz, but you
were the only one who knew Martin's secret.

693
00:47:12.955 --> 00:47:14.787
Somebody talked.

694
00:47:15.708 --> 00:47:19.326
So make yourself comfortable. We're
all staying right here tonight.

695
00:47:20.087 --> 00:47:25.002
No. I'm getting my bag,
and I'm leaving.

696
00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:27.341
So relax, Crease.

697
00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:32.839
I'll relax when we get
that damn thing out of here.

698
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:34.765
Until then, you stay.

699
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.304
What?

700
00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:43.270
There isn't a government
on this planet

701
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:46.103
that wouldn't kill us all
for that thing.

702
00:47:56.332 --> 00:47:57.493
Sorry.

703
00:47:58.334 --> 00:47:59.620
I see.

704
00:48:00.002 --> 00:48:02.118
Carl? Hit the alarm.

705
00:48:02.213 --> 00:48:03.544
Mother, lock everything down.

706
00:48:03.631 --> 00:48:05.591
Then kill the lights.
Whistler, unplug that thing.

707
00:48:05.633 --> 00:48:06.668
You bet.

708
00:48:06.759 --> 00:48:08.921
Thank you for the trust,
fellows.

709
00:48:49.844 --> 00:48:53.758
I really enjoyed sleeping
with all you guys. Take care.

710
00:48:53.848 --> 00:48:56.010
Bye, Liz
WHISTLER: You too, Liz.

711
00:49:07.153 --> 00:49:09.690
I hope the hand-off goes well.

712
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:16.526
I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

713
00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:24.325
Martin? Time.

714
00:49:28.716 --> 00:49:30.582
Yeah.

715
00:50:08.964 --> 00:50:10.796
Morning.
Hi.

716
00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:12.373
Any problems?

717
00:50:12.593 --> 00:50:13.799
Nope.

718
00:50:13.886 --> 00:50:15.547
Want a cappuccino?

719
00:50:15.721 --> 00:50:16.756
No.

720
00:50:39.203 --> 00:50:41.114
Got his check?

721
00:50:46.001 --> 00:50:48.288
Hey, Martin!

722
00:50:48.379 --> 00:50:50.711
Telephone!

723
00:50:50.798 --> 00:50:52.380
Just a minute.

724
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.132
It's your mother.

725
00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:13.314
She's... She's old. Excuse me.

726
00:51:25.833 --> 00:51:27.369
Get in the car.

727
00:51:27.585 --> 00:51:28.916
What?

728
00:51:29.003 --> 00:51:30.914
Get in the car.

729
00:51:33.132 --> 00:51:34.839
I didn't get the money.

730
00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.040
Now!

731
00:51:40.347 --> 00:51:42.805
What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

732
00:51:42.891 --> 00:51:44.552
Janek's dead.

733
00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:48.098
They killed him.

734
00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:51.556
The NSA doesn't kill people,
Martin. Who are they?

735
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.436
You said there isn't a
government on earth

736
00:51:53.527 --> 00:51:54.858
that wouldn't kill
for that thing.

737
00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:57.607
Not ours.
Who were those guys?

738
00:51:58.365 --> 00:52:00.276
There's one way to find out.

739
00:52:21.013 --> 00:52:27.726
They took away my home. Help me out?
The government took away my home.

740
00:52:30.731 --> 00:52:32.221
My God.

741
00:52:37.655 --> 00:52:40.443
Don't tell me you can't do it
because I know you can.

742
00:52:40.532 --> 00:52:43.194
And don't tell me you won't do
it, because I've got to have it.

743
00:52:43.285 --> 00:52:46.027
Damn it! I need to know,
and I need to know now.

744
00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:48.829
Hey, guys,
that federal building?

745
00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:50.310
Scheduled for demolition
since August.

746
00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:53.095
It housed the Federal Trade Commission,
the Department of Agriculture.

747
00:52:53.128 --> 00:52:54.243
Been vacant for a month.

748
00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:56.375
The NSA never had an office
in San Francisco.

749
00:52:56.465 --> 00:52:59.253
Their West Coast operations
are right out of Los Angeles.

750
00:52:59.343 --> 00:53:01.960
Oh, God.
Yeah, thanks.

751
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:04.637
Janek's grant is from the NSA.

752
00:53:04.723 --> 00:53:06.384
Oh no.

753
00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.552
How could you
be so goddamn stupid?

754
00:53:10.646 --> 00:53:13.855
Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

755
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:16.478
They probably were government...

756
00:53:18.862 --> 00:53:20.318
Just not ours.

757
00:53:25.077 --> 00:53:28.945
Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This place isn't safe.

758
00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.448
What do you think you're doing?

759
00:53:32.543 --> 00:53:33.704
I'm going to a concert.

760
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:00.522
Keep smiling.

761
00:54:01.947 --> 00:54:03.984
Martin, have you lost your mind?

762
00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.735
Excuse yourself.

763
00:54:07.828 --> 00:54:10.866
Darling, would you
excuse me for a moment?

764
00:54:25.679 --> 00:54:27.761
Give me back Janek's box, Greg.

765
00:54:27.848 --> 00:54:29.839
Martin, I don't have it.

766
00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:32.345
Now you must believe me.

767
00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:33.767
No.

768
00:54:33.896 --> 00:54:36.729
You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not believe you.

769
00:54:36.815 --> 00:54:39.432
We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

770
00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:41.642
Not for lack of trying,
mind you.

771
00:54:41.987 --> 00:54:44.604
Your codes are entirely
different from ours.

772
00:54:44.698 --> 00:54:46.439
We never had any luck
in breaking them,

773
00:54:46.533 --> 00:54:48.865
so Lord knows,
I wanted that box,

774
00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:52.199
but we did not take it.

775
00:54:57.211 --> 00:54:59.293
Then who did?

776
00:55:02.257 --> 00:55:05.124
What I will tell you now I cannot
tell you in this building.

777
00:55:05.219 --> 00:55:06.960
Do you understand?

778
00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:10.550
Come.

779
00:55:14.394 --> 00:55:15.930
Martin.

780
00:55:18.357 --> 00:55:20.223
You must trust me.

781
00:55:28.492 --> 00:55:29.573
Him?

782
00:55:30.077 --> 00:55:31.158
No.

783
00:55:32.621 --> 00:55:33.986
Him.

784
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:35.242
No.

785
00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:41.744
Him?

786
00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:46.003
I'm afraid these books are not
as current as they used to be.

787
00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:47.879
You still
keep tabs on all our agents.

788
00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.257
These are just the ones
we thought we could turn.

789
00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:54.261
You know, sexual problems,
financial troubles.

790
00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:57.761
Then we had financial troubles.

791
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:01.685
That's him. The older guy.

792
00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:05.518
A loathsome man
named Buddy DeVries,

793
00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:08.480
A.K.A. Buddy Weber,
Buddy Wallace.

794
00:56:08.574 --> 00:56:11.362
Wallace. That's him.

795
00:56:11.743 --> 00:56:16.704
We tried to recruit him in '83.
Drinking problem, married three times.

796
00:56:18.125 --> 00:56:20.241
Left the NSA four years ago.

797
00:56:21.962 --> 00:56:23.919
Oh, my-

798
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:26.087
What?

799
00:56:29.469 --> 00:56:30.675
What?

800
00:56:31.763 --> 00:56:36.849
You disappeared once before, my friend.
I suggest you do it again.

801
00:56:38.312 --> 00:56:41.179
Why? Who's he working for?

802
00:56:45.277 --> 00:56:48.235
Your FBI
is such a pain in the ass.

803
00:56:53.744 --> 00:56:55.610
Who's he working for?

804
00:56:56.371 --> 00:57:00.205
Martin, I can offer you asylum
inside this car.

805
00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:02.533
Technically,
it's part of the consulate.

806
00:57:02.628 --> 00:57:03.868
Do you wish our protection?

807
00:57:03.962 --> 00:57:06.374
What? Who is Wallace
working for?

808
00:57:11.303 --> 00:57:14.421
Mr. Bishop? My name is
Special Agent Bestrop, FBI.

809
00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:17.006
Please, step out of the vehicle.

810
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:19.265
Do you wish our protection?

811
00:57:19.353 --> 00:57:20.764
Mr. Bishop.

812
00:57:20.896 --> 00:57:23.183
Get out of the vehicle now.

813
00:57:29.363 --> 00:57:32.105
You won't know who to trust.

814
00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:40.905
Mr. Bishop, step over here, please.
Hands on the wall, sir.

815
00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:54.589
Is this loaded?

816
00:57:55.138 --> 00:57:56.219
Yes.

817
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.200
Too many secrets.

818
00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:37.813
Oh, shit.

819
00:59:38.075 --> 00:59:39.986
What are you doing up?

820
01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.659
Pain?

821
01:00:36.258 --> 01:00:37.919
Yeah.

822
01:00:44.766 --> 01:00:46.677
Try aspirin.

823
01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:54.560
Cosmo.

824
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.402
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

825
01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:05.735
I'm afraid Wallace
doesn't like you very much.

826
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.872
You ought to have that guy
checked for rabies.

827
01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:13.917
Rabies occurs
only in warm-blooded animals.

828
01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:18.331
Anyway, I couldn't have you
talking to the Russians.

829
01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:22.510
Five years ago, yes, we could trust
them not to go running to the FBI,

830
01:01:22.596 --> 01:01:24.928
or if they did, we could trust
the FBI not to believe them.

831
01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:28.758
Today we can't trust anybody.

832
01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.767
What the hell's going on here?
Cosmo, what...

833
01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.024
What happened?

834
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:42.321
The world changed on us,
Marty, and without our help.

835
01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:45.323
What happened?

836
01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:57.041
There I was in prison, and one day I
help a couple of nice older gentlemen

837
01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.417
make some free telephone calls.

838
01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:03.592
They turn out to be,
let us say, good family men.

839
01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:07.797
Organized crime?

840
01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.344
Don't kid yourself.

841
01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.885
It's not that organized.

842
01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:16.062
Anyway, they arranged for me
to get an early release

843
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.390
from my
unfortunate incarceration,

844
01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:21.477
and I began to perform
a variety of services.

845
01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:26.407
For starters, I reorganized their
entire financial operation:

846
01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:29.235
budgets, payroll,
money laundering, you name it.

847
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:32.572
The whole network is protected by
a very powerful encryption system

848
01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.657
so the government
cannot read it.

849
01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.914
But if the feds
get Janek's box...

850
01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:42.665
Disaster. Therefore,
we must have it.

851
01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.464
To protect the organization.

852
01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:47.836
Yes.

853
01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.636
No, I don't buy it.

854
01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.061
I know you.

855
01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.523
God, it's good to see you.

856
01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:16.957
We were going to
change the world, Marty, remember?

857
01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:21.128
Did you ever get around to actually
doing it? No, I guess not.

858
01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:23.376
Well, I think I can.

859
01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:24.918
Really.

860
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:26.045
Yes.

861
01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:35.343
What's wrong with this country, Marty?
Money. You taught me that.

862
01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:39.555
Evil defense contractors
had it, noble causes did not.

863
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:44.151
Politicians are bought and sold like so
much chattel. Our problems multiply.

864
01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:47.901
Pollution, crime, drugs, poverty,
disease, hunger, despair.

865
01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:51.074
We throw gobs of money at them.

866
01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:54.495
The problems always get worse.
Why is that?

867
01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:58.165
Because money's most powerful
ability is to allow bad people

868
01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:01.164
to continue doing bad things at the
expense of those who don't have it.

869
01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:03.712
I agree. Who did you say
you were working for?

870
01:04:03.798 --> 01:04:05.914
That's just my day job.

871
01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:09.627
Listen, when I was in prison, I learned
that everything in this world,

872
01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:12.383
including money,
operates not on reality...

873
01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.761
But the perception of reality.

874
01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:21.646
Posit, people think a bank
might be financially shaky.

875
01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:23.895
Consequence, people start
to withdraw their money.

876
01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.942
Result, pretty soon,
it is financially shaky.

877
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:28.066
Conclusion,
you can make banks fail.

878
01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.278
I've already done that.
Maybe you've read about a few?

879
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:35.197
Think bigger.

880
01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.449
Stock market?
Yes.

881
01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:39.035
Currency market?
Commodities market? Yes.

882
01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.207
Small countries?

883
01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:47.419
I might even be able to crash
the whole damn system.

884
01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:52.545
Destroy all records of ownership.
Think of it, Marty.

885
01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:56.223
No more rich people. No more poor people.
Everybody's the same.

886
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.846
Isn't that what we said
we always wanted?

887
01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:02.888
Cos, you haven't gone crazy
on me, have you?

888
01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:06.350
Who else is going to change
the world, Marty?

889
01:05:06.444 --> 01:05:08.310
Greenpeace?

890
01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:16.785
You are crazy.

891
01:05:22.919 --> 01:05:25.001
Tomorrow they will retrieve
your fingerprints

892
01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.750
from the gun that killed a
Russian consular officer.

893
01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:31.755
The following day, those prints will
be run through an FBI computer,

894
01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.927
and they will come up
with a name.

895
01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:42.595
Martin Brice,
my old and good friend,

896
01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:46.307
who promised me we would not get in
trouble and who, I might add, did not.

897
01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:49.439
Then they will check this
database in Washington, D.C.

898
01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:52.442
which I'm now able to access,
thanks to you.

899
01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:57.493
Of course, no one knows where
Martin Brice is, do they?

900
01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:01.868
But what if this indicated...

901
01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:06.702
An alias?

902
01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.205
Don't.

903
01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:12.958
Don't do it, Cos.

904
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.802
Pain?

905
01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:20.553
Try prison.

906
01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:26.938
Ciao.

907
01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:30.980
Oh no, not the head.

908
01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.481
Just relax.

909
01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.735
No more secrets, Marty.

910
01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:30.411
I've had a bad night.

911
01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:31.666
Really.

912
01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:33.417
You look terrific.

913
01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.206
You look awful.

914
01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:37.838
I should think so, considering
what I've been through.

915
01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:38.929
What happened?

916
01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:40.469
You tell me.

917
01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:45.012
You got hit over the head twice and
got thrown out of a speeding car?

918
01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.766
Here, let me do this.

919
01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.975
I'm sorry.

920
01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:57.570
It's okay. I...

921
01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:01.904
I'm sorry.

922
01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:14.708
The paper said that Greg
was killed.

923
01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.251
I called your number,
and someone else answered.

924
01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:21.837
I didn't recognize the voice.

925
01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.359
I can't do this alone, Liz.

926
01:08:37.655 --> 01:08:39.145
I'm here.

927
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:00.925
We have to meet.

928
01:09:01.387 --> 01:09:04.300
<i>The FBI says the fingerprints
found in the embassy car</i>

929
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.428
<i>matched those taken from the
office of a government researcher</i>

930
01:09:07.518 --> 01:09:10.681
<i>found murdered earlier
this week in Palo Alto.</i>

931
01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:14.811
<i>The connection was made after a Bay Area
radio station received an anonymous tip,</i>

932
01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:18.144
<i>linking the two killings.
More bad news...</i>

933
01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.944
The son of a bitch.

934
01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.273
All right. It's time we
call the authorities.

935
01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:27.160
Great. Now that we're accessories
to espionage and murder.

936
01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:31.160
All the more reason to turn ourselves
in now while we can still cut a deal.

937
01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:35.369
With what? We got bupkus! They'll give
us 20 years in the electric chair.

938
01:09:35.463 --> 01:09:39.832
You think I like it? I've got a family!
We have no other choice.

939
01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:45.922
Yes, we do. We make the call,
but we make it our way.

940
01:09:46.766 --> 01:09:47.927
Unload the van.

941
01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:52.011
We got these band wideners here, Whis.
Where do you want them?

942
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.523
Thanks. Nice apartment.

943
01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:04.254
I'm going to bounce this call through
nine different relay stations

944
01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.900
throughout the world
and off two satellites.

945
01:10:06.994 --> 01:10:09.907
It'll be the hardest trace
they've ever heard.

946
01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:12.956
This'll measure stress
in the voice on the other end.

947
01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:16.535
Not as accurate
as a polygraph, but it'll do.

948
01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:18.870
Unbelievable.

949
01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:20.421
Let's do it.

950
01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:33.635
<i>Fort Meade, Maryland.
Good afternoon.</i>

951
01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:36.225
Try director of ops.

952
01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:39.725
National Security Agency,
director of operations, please.

953
01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:41.526
<i>Extension, please?</i>

954
01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:43.728
I'm sorry.
I forget the number.

955
01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:46.736
Could I please have director of operations?
It's very important.

956
01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:48.942
<i>What extension, please?</i>

957
01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:51.160
Try research.

958
01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:54.410
Give me research.
It's an emergency.

959
01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.787
<i>I need an extension or a name.</i>

960
01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:01.580
Setec Astronomy.

961
01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.751
<i>One moment, please.</i>

962
01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:09.880
They've started the trace.

963
01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.840
<i>Who is this, please?</i>

964
01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.266
It's my dime. I'll ask the questions.
Who are you?

965
01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:17.345
<i>Well, let's say my name
is Mr. Abbott.</i>

966
01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.139
True.

967
01:11:19.984 --> 01:11:21.600
They made the second leg.

968
01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:25.938
Mr. Abbott, are you interested
in Setec Astronomy?

969
01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:29.195
<i>I'm interested
in all kinds of astronomy.</i>

970
01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:35.080
Cute. They've got the
satellite in Tokyo.

971
01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.491
These guys are good.

972
01:11:40.379 --> 01:11:43.337
I need to know if you're
someone who can make a deal.

973
01:11:43.424 --> 01:11:44.630
Go on.

974
01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:46.132
Can you deal?

975
01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:47.300
<i>Yes.</i>

976
01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:48.713
True.

977
01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.593
They're across Transcom. You've
got about 20 seconds, Bish.

978
01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:54.720
If I come in,
can you guarantee my safety?

979
01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:57.810
<i>Do you have the item?</i>

980
01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:00.309
No.

981
01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:01.855
Fifteen seconds.

982
01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:03.559
Can you guarantee my safety?

983
01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.064
<i>Where is the item?</i>

984
01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.565
Can you guarantee my safety?

985
01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:07.737
Five seconds.

986
01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:10.031
<i>Yes, I can guarantee
your safety.</i>

987
01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:11.403
Bish, he's lying.

988
01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:12.984
Hang up.
They've almost got us.

989
01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.240
He's lying!

990
01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:17.410
Hang up, Bish! Hang up! MOTHER:
He's lying! He's lying!

991
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:30.342
There's gotta be a way
to cut a deal.

992
01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:31.760
Too late.

993
01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:35.014
If we had the box, yes.
Without it, no.

994
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.513
So let's get
this frigging thing.

995
01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.968
I don't know
where it is, remember?

996
01:12:39.063 --> 01:12:40.929
What did it sound like?

997
01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.684
No idea where they took you?

998
01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.061
No.

999
01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:46.380
They threw me in a trunk,
drove around in circles.

1000
01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:50.864
It could be a hundred miles away, next door,
underground, in a sky-rise. Forget it.

1001
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:52.361
Bish, what did it sound like?

1002
01:12:52.451 --> 01:12:53.566
What?

1003
01:12:53.661 --> 01:12:57.780
The road. When you were in the
trunk, what did the road sound like?

1004
01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:01.867
Well, I... Highway.
A regular highway.

1005
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:07.752
Well, did you go over any speed bumps?
Gravel? How about a bridge?

1006
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.547
Bridge, yeah.

1007
01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.969
Four bridges in the Bay Area.

1008
01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.718
Was the Golden Gate
fogged in last night?

1009
01:13:16.809 --> 01:13:17.924
Yes.

1010
01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.351
Did you hear a foghorn?

1011
01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.178
No.

1012
01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:26.562
Scratch the Golden Gate.
That leaves three.

1013
01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:30.111
What did it sound like?
Did you go through a tunnel?

1014
01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:32.484
I'm not... No.

1015
01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:34.866
Scratch the Bay.

1016
01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:37.152
That leaves two.
San Mateo and Dumbarton.

1017
01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:42.457
What did it sound like?

1018
01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:46.787
Lower.

1019
01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.212
Lower.

1020
01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.306
There was a recurring sound.

1021
01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:02.010
Like seams in the concrete.

1022
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:13.522
But further apart.

1023
01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.697
Yeah.

1024
01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.345
Now what?

1025
01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.639
Bumps. Rough ones.

1026
01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:43.384
Railroad tracks.
Yeah, yeah.

1027
01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.938
A right on Antrim
and a left on 84.

1028
01:14:47.608 --> 01:14:50.066
And then what did you hear?

1029
01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:52.977
Cocktail party.

1030
01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:54.233
What?

1031
01:14:57.702 --> 01:15:03.994
Drove through what sounded... lt
sounded like a cocktail party.

1032
01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.083
There was chattering.
It was right at the end.

1033
01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.706
Great. Now we got to look
for a cocktail party

1034
01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:11.583
on the other side
of the railroad track.

1035
01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:14.962
What's the exit
where the railroad tracks are?

1036
01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:16.175
Crescent.

1037
01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:18.924
Mother, stay on Crescent,
get off at the reservoir.

1038
01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:20.426
Okay.

1039
01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:24.430
There's a cocktail party
at the reservoir?

1040
01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.770
Yeah. Yeah.

1041
01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:36.359
Very good, Bish. Remind me to make
you an honorary blind person.

1042
01:15:37.658 --> 01:15:38.989
Great.

1043
01:15:41.287 --> 01:15:43.449
Where's this road go?

1044
01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:48.825
Nowhere. Looks like it
ends right around that hill.

1045
01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.789
What's behind the hill?

1046
01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.121
Nothing.
It's private property.

1047
01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:58.417
Private.

1048
01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:30.083
Forget it. It's a toy company.

1049
01:16:31.170 --> 01:16:34.208
A toy company, my ass.
That's laser fencing.

1050
01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.331
There's high voltage
on the perimeter.

1051
01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.917
The whole building says,
"Go away."

1052
01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:42.754
It's Cosmo. I know it.
The toy company's a front.

1053
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:47.304
Mother, get the directional.
Carl, get the video. Let's go.

1054
01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:54.898
Second floor, northwest two.

1055
01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:57.318
That's a bathroom.

1056
01:16:58.572 --> 01:17:00.939
Second floor, northwest three.

1057
01:17:02.243 --> 01:17:04.280
Ah, it's an emergency exit.

1058
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.952
How do you know that?

1059
01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:09.952
I can hear the emergency
floodlight batteries recharging.

1060
01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:15.328
Hold it right there.
Crease, what's this mean?

1061
01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:18.210
"My voice is my passport.
Verify me"?

1062
01:17:18.342 --> 01:17:21.755
Some sort of voiceprint l.D.
I'll check it out.

1063
01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.349
What am I listening to now,
Mother?

1064
01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:31.177
Third floor, southwest corner.

1065
01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:34.146
Oh, it's bursting
with ultrasonic.

1066
01:17:34.233 --> 01:17:37.066
I've never heard sensors
that powerful before.

1067
01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:41.821
Bish, someone is very serious about
keeping people out of that room.

1068
01:17:42.366 --> 01:17:43.572
Yeah.

1069
01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.786
Okay.

1070
01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:58.500
Okay, there's the corner room
with the motion detectors Whistler heard.

1071
01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:01.253
That's Cosmo's
office. I saw the sensors.

1072
01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.959
They keep the lights
on all night,

1073
01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.045
so we have to assume
the sensors are on too.

1074
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.596
It won't be easy
getting in there.

1075
01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:11.392
Run this on ahead. Let's figure
out who works next door.

1076
01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:17.937
It's fascinating what 50 bucks can get
you at the county recorder's office.

1077
01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.609
What do you got?

1078
01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.610
PlayTronics'
corporate headquarters.

1079
01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:23.358
The complete blueprints.

1080
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:25.690
Not bad. Not bad, Carl.

1081
01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.274
Oh, thanks.

1082
01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:29.819
Where'd you get the 50 bucks?

1083
01:18:29.914 --> 01:18:31.905
I took it from Mother's wallet.

1084
01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.285
Good.

1085
01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:37.456
No, Mom, today's not a good
day to come over. No...

1086
01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.208
Okay, what have we got here?

1087
01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:44.167
It's called a mantrap. I borrowed
this demo from the manufacturer.

1088
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:48.220
It's a digital voice-recognition
monitor hooked up to an access booth.

1089
01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:50.014
NSA uses the same technology

1090
01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.593
to keep people out of
restricted areas at Fort Meade.

1091
01:18:53.687 --> 01:18:54.927
Card?

1092
01:18:59.109 --> 01:19:01.316
Now speak right into this box.

1093
01:19:02.321 --> 01:19:03.402
Hi.

1094
01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.947
My name is Martin Bishop.

1095
01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:09.071
My voice is my passport.
Verify me.

1096
01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:12.869
And you can't pass through

1097
01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:15.699
unless your voiceprint matches
the one encoded on the card.

1098
01:19:15.793 --> 01:19:19.127
So we need someone's card.
And their voice.

1099
01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:20.578
Can we beat this with tape?

1100
01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:22.584
Has to be up close and personal.

1101
01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:25.588
Otherwise you'll be caught
in a steel-reinforced booth

1102
01:19:25.678 --> 01:19:28.090
while the guards
with the shotguns are called.

1103
01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.420
Ah, that's great.

1104
01:19:29.515 --> 01:19:31.256
Really great.
What about motion detectors?

1105
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:35.560
I'm picking one up this afternoon.
That makes beating this look easy.

1106
01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.893
Hey, Bish,
I think we've found our guy.

1107
01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.194
Okay, I've blown up the image a little.
Here's the room next to Cosmo's.

1108
01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:48.774
Now it's the end of the day.
Watch who comes out.

1109
01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:51.359
Let me zoom in
on the front door.

1110
01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:56.619
A lady in a green skirt
and this guy with the cap.

1111
01:19:57.543 --> 01:20:01.332
Nobody comes out for another 18 minutes.
So it's one of those two.

1112
01:20:01.422 --> 01:20:05.006
Right. Here's the next evening.
Again...

1113
01:20:05.843 --> 01:20:09.302
The office next to Cosmo's.
Lights go out.

1114
01:20:12.516 --> 01:20:13.597
The guy in the cap.

1115
01:20:13.684 --> 01:20:14.890
Anybody else?

1116
01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:18.971
Nobody else comes out for <i>22</i> minutes.
That's who works next door.

1117
01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:22.978
We'll use his office to get into Cosmo's.
Can we get plates?

1118
01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.558
Let me see.

1119
01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.692
Zooming in.

1120
01:20:30.159 --> 01:20:32.901
Another bump. Enhancing.

1121
01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.243
There's your plate. 180 IQ.

1122
01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:45.084
Cute. All right. Carl,
let's do this guy.

1123
01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:48.007
His name's Werner Brandes.

1124
01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:51.506
Single, 6'1", 174 pounds,
must wear glasses to drive,

1125
01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.383
no outstanding
tickets or warrants.

1126
01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:57.467
He leaves work between
6:00 and 7:00 every night,

1127
01:20:57.561 --> 01:21:00.019
takes the same route home,
he obeys the speed limit,

1128
01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:04.349
comes to a complete stop at every stop
sign and signals when he changes lanes.

1129
01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:05.729
He's a very safe driver.

1130
01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:13.696
$750 limit on his Visa, pays his
bills, no bad debts, no bum checks.

1131
01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:15.651
No registered firearms.

1132
01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:18.989
Member, International Microchip
Designers Association

1133
01:21:19.083 --> 01:21:21.290
and chairman
of the social committee.

1134
01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.495
Great. The world's most
boring human.

1135
01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.046
How the hell are we going to get
close enough to record him?

1136
01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.384
Oh, Mother.

1137
01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:37.636
Sorry, Liz. Standard procedure.
Trash from the guy's house.

1138
01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:41.936
And thank you
for bringing it into mine.

1139
01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:51.650
Okay, let's see here. Phone bill,
no long distance. Club Med brochure.

1140
01:21:53.659 --> 01:21:56.697
A ticket stub
to a Barry Manilow concert.

1141
01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:01.405
Here it is. Here we go.

1142
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:06.085
"Dear Compudater. Welcome to the
world of automated compatibility."

1143
01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:08.838
He's a computer dater.

1144
01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.915
I love it.
Let's get him a date.

1145
01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:14.843
What was the name of that girl that we used
on the cereal company sneak last year?

1146
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:17.922
Sandy Krieger?
Forget it. Married a cop.

1147
01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:22.101
How about Barbara?
Now, she was cute.

1148
01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:25.396
Yeah, but she'd never do it. She
regards this work <i>as</i> juvenile.

1149
01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:28.895
That's why she divorced me.
How about your friend Jessie?

1150
01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:31.944
Yeah, she's buff.
Fellows...

1151
01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:37.442
Fellows, look at this man's trash.
He's not looking for buff.

1152
01:22:37.536 --> 01:22:40.153
It's the nicest garbage
I've ever seen.

1153
01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:42.204
The man who folded
this tube of Crest

1154
01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:45.534
is looking for someone
meticulous, refined...

1155
01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.535
Anal.

1156
01:22:53.177 --> 01:22:54.588
What?

1157
01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:19.359
Werner? Hi. I'm Doris.

1158
01:23:20.579 --> 01:23:21.740
Hi.

1159
01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.164
Are you ready
for the dim sum bar?

1160
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.582
Oh, I'm not really in any hurry.

1161
01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:30.412
All right.
I'll be right back.

1162
01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:58.230
So.
So.

1163
01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:04.450
What an interesting name you have.
How exactly do you pronounce it?

1164
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.292
This is what's
in Cosmo's office.

1165
01:24:21.557 --> 01:24:24.140
The best motion sensor
on the market.

1166
01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:26.058
Watch this.

1167
01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.643
It also responds
to thermal differentials.

1168
01:24:31.942 --> 01:24:33.273
Does this have a happy ending?

1169
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.521
Oh, yeah.

1170
01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:37.979
We can wrap you in a full body suit
of neoprene, heat-resistant rubber,

1171
01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.133
or we can raise the temperature

1172
01:24:39.157 --> 01:24:41.148
in Cosmo's office
to 98.6 degrees,

1173
01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:42.859
which is probably
what we'll have to do

1174
01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:44.864
because the neoprene
would suffocate you.

1175
01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:50.541
Either way, you've got a top
speed of two inches per second.

1176
01:24:51.044 --> 01:24:53.661
Any faster than that...

1177
01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:57.631
And big guys with guns.
You'll probably do fine.

1178
01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:00.046
Since when am I the one...

1179
01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:03.004
This is the same answering machine
Janek used for the shell of his box.

1180
01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:06.682
That's what you'll be carrying across
the floor at two inches per second.

1181
01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:10.932
I got that for you because I figured
you'd just want to practice with it.

1182
01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:13.014
Remember to go real slow!

1183
01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.015
Slow.

1184
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:20.733
You get all the fun stuff.

1185
01:25:39.092 --> 01:25:44.553
So, what about travel? Where do
you like to go? Europe? Mexico?

1186
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:47.597
I don't know. I've never
been out of the country.

1187
01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:49.641
I think they want us to leave.

1188
01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:51.435
Sit down, Werner.

1189
01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:56.061
Talk to me. You know what?

1190
01:25:57.277 --> 01:26:00.395
I really love the sound
of your voice.

1191
01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:05.108
Really? I always thought it was
kind of nasal and pinched.

1192
01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:08.240
Oh no, not at all.
It's lovely.

1193
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:15.293
And there's this one word. I've
always loved the sound of this word.

1194
01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:18.457
Oh no!
No, what? What?

1195
01:26:18.548 --> 01:26:21.540
You wouldn't. Never mind.
I would. What, please?

1196
01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:24.005
Oh, all right.

1197
01:26:24.221 --> 01:26:29.216
I would really like to
hear you say the word...

1198
01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:32.434
"Passport."

1199
01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:37.306
Passport?

1200
01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:41.860
Passport.

1201
01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:44.860
You know, you're right.
We ought to leave.

1202
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:46.156
Doris?

1203
01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.903
Would you like
to have breakfast with me?

1204
01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:52.700
Sure, fine.

1205
01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:56.458
Shall I phone you or nudge you?

1206
01:26:59.131 --> 01:27:00.337
Check, please.

1207
01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:14.727
<i>Hi. My name is Werner Brandes.</i>

1208
01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:18.431
<i>My voice is my passport.
Verify me. Thank you.</i>

1209
01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:43.832
Is that the gardener?
I thought he'd already left.

1210
01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.715
I guess not.

1211
01:27:56.062 --> 01:27:58.394
May I use your john, please?

1212
01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:11.677
Listen, a few minutes ago,
a gardener came...

1213
01:29:14.599 --> 01:29:16.431
Skip it. I see him.

1214
01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:26.942
Okay, fellows, I'm out of here.
Carl, have a nice ride.

1215
01:30:06.526 --> 01:30:08.062
Oh, it's hot in here.

1216
01:30:08.153 --> 01:30:09.393
Uh-huh.

1217
01:30:10.155 --> 01:30:13.614
Maybe I'll just
open this window a bit.

1218
01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:16.988
I'll join you as soon as I'm
through pounding these breasts.

1219
01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:22.327
Do you know, the
best thing about this meal,

1220
01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:27.537
besides it's absolutely fabulous,
is that it only has 400 calories.

1221
01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:28.962
Oh, great.

1222
01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:30.915
I'm very concerned
about what we eat.

1223
01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.009
You are.

1224
01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:34.585
What would you say
is the ideal diet?

1225
01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:39.344
Well, sort of, eat, sort of on the run.
I'm really busy, so...

1226
01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:44.554
The ideal diet, don't laugh, is
the bottom of a monkey cage.

1227
01:30:44.898 --> 01:30:46.138
I'm sorry?

1228
01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:48.815
Take a look at the bottom
of a monkey cage.

1229
01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.401
Is someone at your door?

1230
01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.814
Just a second.
I'm not expecting anyone.

1231
01:30:57.786 --> 01:31:01.029
No. Nobody there.

1232
01:31:01.206 --> 01:31:04.039
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're all alone.

1233
01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:08.460
I'll just close the window.
It's okay now.

1234
01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:10.830
It's true. I read that once.

1235
01:31:10.924 --> 01:31:12.524
I don't know. What are
you talking about?

1236
01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:15.801
You have fruit, greens...

1237
01:31:20.183 --> 01:31:23.096
<i>Good evening. PlayTronics.</i>

1238
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.251
Cattle mutilations are up.

1239
01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.828
Don't.

1240
01:31:51.923 --> 01:31:53.334
Sorry.

1241
01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:22.826
Hey, here we go.

1242
01:32:22.912 --> 01:32:24.277
We've got video,
all eight of them.

1243
01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.534
Whistler, hit record.

1244
01:32:26.624 --> 01:32:28.035
You're coming in fine.

1245
01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:30.959
You are clear all the way
up to the mantrap.

1246
01:32:56.112 --> 01:32:57.898
<i>Hi, my name is...</i>

1247
01:33:07.457 --> 01:33:10.995
<i>Hi, my name is Werner Brandes.</i>

1248
01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:14.920
<i>My voice is my passport.
Verify me.</i>

1249
01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.743
There's a three-foot area
in the corner,

1250
01:34:49.767 --> 01:34:51.929
<i>just outside the sensor's range.</i>

1251
01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:54.515
Good. Hold on. Whistler?

1252
01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:57.018
Carl, how's the weather?

1253
01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:59.315
98.6 and holding.

1254
01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:02.690
Beauty.
We got body temp, Crease.

1255
01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:05.029
Go.

1256
01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:29.179
Once again, I am so
sorry about dinner.

1257
01:35:29.474 --> 01:35:32.057
No, it was really delicious.

1258
01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:35.306
No, no.
I overcooked the carrots.

1259
01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:38.684
No, I like them really squishy
like that.

1260
01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:41.645
That's cute.

1261
01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:44.774
Oh, oh, watch.
Watch this.

1262
01:35:50.078 --> 01:35:51.660
Play dead.

1263
01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:55.872
Great!

1264
01:35:55.959 --> 01:35:58.371
I designed
the voice recognition chip.

1265
01:35:58.461 --> 01:36:02.750
What a thing to do! Could I
just make a quick phone call?

1266
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.252
Sure. It's in
the bedroom.

1267
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:07.171
Upstairs?

1268
01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:12.348
Yeah, just go upstairs and
then walk straight forward.

1269
01:36:13.059 --> 01:36:15.346
The first one is a closet.

1270
01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:22.270
Oh, pooch. Look what you've
done to Doris's purse.

1271
01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:27.399
Hmm.

1272
01:36:52.682 --> 01:36:53.682
Psst!

1273
01:36:53.975 --> 01:36:57.093
What do you say
we go for a ride, Doris?

1274
01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:17.779
I don't believe this!

1275
01:37:18.082 --> 01:37:20.494
Now what are you saying?
The NSA killed Kennedy?

1276
01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:24.579
No, they shot him, but they didn't
kill him. He's still alive.

1277
01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:29.292
That's it. I've had it. I don't
want to talk to you anymore.

1278
01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:31.631
Just do your job. I don't
want to talk to you anymore.

1279
01:37:31.721 --> 01:37:33.211
Okay, fine.

1280
01:37:33.639 --> 01:37:36.256
It was the same people
who framed Pete Rose.

1281
01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:41.682
Boy, this was fun.
Wanna go back?

1282
01:37:41.773 --> 01:37:43.730
No, we're almost there.

1283
01:37:43.816 --> 01:37:45.272
Almost where?

1284
01:37:51.157 --> 01:37:52.318
Crease!
Forget it.

1285
01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:54.111
No, Crease.
Forget it.

1286
01:37:54.202 --> 01:37:56.534
Werner just pulled up.
He's got Liz with him.

1287
01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:58.111
No.

1288
01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:03.666
Martin?
I think you better hurry.

1289
01:38:07.548 --> 01:38:10.961
The one thing
I can't do is hurry.

1290
01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:38.486
<i>"Come on. I want you to say
it for me just one time.</i>

1291
01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:41.412
<i>"Passport. You have such
a beautiful voice."</i>

1292
01:38:41.499 --> 01:38:44.742
<i>I'm Dr. Brandes. I work up on three.
I believe this phony</i>

1293
01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:47.498
<i>is involved in some plot
to break into my office.</i>

1294
01:38:47.588 --> 01:38:51.252
<i>Hold it! Hold it! Let
me see your entry card.</i>

1295
01:38:52.718 --> 01:38:55.631
<i>You took my card.
What card? See?</i>

1296
01:38:55.721 --> 01:38:58.338
Sir, we have a problem.

1297
01:39:28.588 --> 01:39:31.501
I think that someone is trying
to break into my office!

1298
01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:33.252
Let's take a look at his office.

1299
01:40:19.639 --> 01:40:21.095
Well?

1300
01:40:22.225 --> 01:40:25.343
Well, everything seems
to be in order.

1301
01:40:25.436 --> 01:40:26.972
Does it?
Yes, sir.

1302
01:40:31.192 --> 01:40:32.682
Very sorry to have
troubled you, miss.

1303
01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:35.735
Not as sorry as I am.
Werner?

1304
01:40:44.497 --> 01:40:46.488
They're letting her go.

1305
01:40:47.166 --> 01:40:48.748
We'll call you a cab.

1306
01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:52.247
Thank you.
This is my last computer date.

1307
01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.046
Wait.

1308
01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:02.258
A computer matched her
with him? I don't think so.

1309
01:41:06.644 --> 01:41:07.975
Marty.

1310
01:41:17.613 --> 01:41:20.150
Why is it so hot in here?

1311
01:41:29.834 --> 01:41:31.575
Marty!

1312
01:41:39.719 --> 01:41:41.530
Martin, we've got
six guards in the front lobby,

1313
01:41:41.554 --> 01:41:44.592
four in the south corridor,
five upstairs north.

1314
01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:45.763
Guards in the boiler room.

1315
01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.090
Oh, God.

1316
01:41:47.351 --> 01:41:50.685
Carl, listen carefully.
You've got trouble.

1317
01:41:51.063 --> 01:41:52.679
Heating ducts over the furnace.

1318
01:41:52.773 --> 01:41:55.606
You'll be all right. Find the
heating ducts above the furnace.

1319
01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:58.060
That'll lead you
to the elevator chase.

1320
01:41:58.529 --> 01:42:01.317
There's a fire escape at the
end of the north corridor.

1321
01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:03.677
You'll have to break through fire walls.
Have him go south.

1322
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:07.990
No. Go directly north, 30 yards.
There's an air duct there!

1323
01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.071
Once you're there, let me know.

1324
01:42:10.207 --> 01:42:13.950
Blue team, move to corridor one.
Green team, secure north corridor.

1325
01:42:14.045 --> 01:42:17.504
He'll be in a crawl space.
Break through.

1326
01:42:31.854 --> 01:42:35.267
Crease? I'm in northeast
three, over the corridor.

1327
01:42:35.358 --> 01:42:37.565
<i>I think it's</i> a <i>dead end.
Don't move.</i>

1328
01:42:39.403 --> 01:42:41.189
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of there.

1329
01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:44.989
We've got guards at every stairwell.
Can you hear if there's any...

1330
01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:53.080
Oh no.

1331
01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:56.581
What? Don't say "Oh no."

1332
01:43:01.133 --> 01:43:04.922
This is Wallace. I'm in northeast three.
I'm gonna check it out.

1333
01:43:07.682 --> 01:43:10.094
Martin, we lost...

1334
01:43:17.566 --> 01:43:19.102
Do you read me?

1335
01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:31.861
Damn!

1336
01:43:36.377 --> 01:43:38.084
<i>Stop shooting.</i>

1337
01:43:39.922 --> 01:43:41.253
Marty?

1338
01:43:42.758 --> 01:43:45.375
I know you are in the building

1339
01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:48.632
<i>and I know you can hear me.</i>

1340
01:43:49.014 --> 01:43:50.345
<i>God.</i>

1341
01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:55.181
<i>You should not
have come back, Marty.</i>

1342
01:43:56.188 --> 01:43:58.304
<i>I won and you lost.</i>

1343
01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:01.899
<i>If our friendship had meant
anything to you at all,</i>

1344
01:44:01.986 --> 01:44:03.422
<i>that is the way
you should have left it.</i>

1345
01:44:03.446 --> 01:44:07.280
<i>But you always had to be the
one to win, didn't you?</i>

1346
01:44:07.366 --> 01:44:10.950
<i>You were the one who got away
with things while I never did.</i>

1347
01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:17.081
<i>You always had to get
the girl, didn't you?</i>

1348
01:44:21.672 --> 01:44:23.663
So I never did...

1349
01:44:27.094 --> 01:44:29.335
At least not until now.

1350
01:44:34.351 --> 01:44:36.809
She's lovely, Marty.

1351
01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:42.523
<i>Please.</i>

1352
01:44:43.486 --> 01:44:46.444
Marty, please bring me the box.

1353
01:44:48.157 --> 01:44:53.368
<i>You must know they will never let either
of you live if you try to get out.</i>

1354
01:44:54.872 --> 01:44:57.364
<i>I am your way out.</i>

1355
01:44:58.834 --> 01:45:00.871
I'm your only way out.

1356
01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.792
<i>If I wanted you dead...</i>

1357
01:45:07.009 --> 01:45:09.751
<i>You'd be dead.</i>

1358
01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:11.757
<i>Marty»</i>

1359
01:45:12.181 --> 01:45:13.922
I cannot kill you.

1360
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:19.473
I cannot kill you.

1361
01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:24.728
You have to trust me.

1362
01:45:28.864 --> 01:45:33.483
Guys, I'm going in.
Do you hear me, Carl?

1363
01:45:36.539 --> 01:45:37.574
Yes.

1364
01:46:00.938 --> 01:46:01.973
Hi.
Hi.

1365
01:46:02.064 --> 01:46:05.056
How are you?
Fine. How are you?

1366
01:46:06.151 --> 01:46:07.437
Yeah.

1367
01:46:10.281 --> 01:46:12.568
So you have my box.

1368
01:46:17.538 --> 01:46:21.281
We have a deal. Right?

1369
01:46:27.089 --> 01:46:29.751
Wait a second. Wait a minute!

1370
01:46:31.969 --> 01:46:34.586
Goddamn it,
you gave me your word!

1371
01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:45.889
I cannot kill my friend.

1372
01:46:49.570 --> 01:46:51.231
Kill my friend.

1373
01:46:55.659 --> 01:46:57.570
You son of a bitch.

1374
01:46:57.703 --> 01:47:01.321
You didn't really think we were
gonna let you go, did you?

1375
01:47:02.333 --> 01:47:06.076
You didn't really think I was gonna
let you have this box, did you?

1376
01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:07.410
What?

1377
01:47:07.504 --> 01:47:08.790
Now.

1378
01:47:08.881 --> 01:47:11.498
Now?
What are you talking about?

1379
01:47:12.051 --> 01:47:13.132
Now!

1380
01:47:13.677 --> 01:47:15.588
You're damn right, now!

1381
01:47:16.847 --> 01:47:17.928
Carl, now!

1382
01:47:18.015 --> 01:47:20.302
Geronimo!

1383
01:47:26.357 --> 01:47:28.189
Let go of him.

1384
01:47:31.487 --> 01:47:36.152
I mean it. I'm an excellent marksman.
Woman! Move!

1385
01:47:36.825 --> 01:47:38.361
Oh, sure. Sure.

1386
01:47:42.498 --> 01:47:43.829
Get up.

1387
01:47:50.673 --> 01:47:52.380
You!

1388
01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:54.919
Carl, what the hell
were you waiting for?

1389
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:56.592
That's not easy,
what I just did.

1390
01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.711
Guys, could we get out of here?
Yeah.

1391
01:48:00.933 --> 01:48:02.219
Here.

1392
01:48:06.522 --> 01:48:08.433
Up, up, up!
I'm up!

1393
01:48:08.524 --> 01:48:09.559
Hurry!

1394
01:48:17.741 --> 01:48:19.323
Crease, we're on the roof.

1395
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:22.402
There's a fire escape on the north side.
Is it clear?

1396
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.287
Yes, clear.

1397
01:48:28.002 --> 01:48:29.242
Where are you?

1398
01:48:29.336 --> 01:48:32.169
<i>On a hill overlooking the
northeast corner of the lot.</i>

1399
01:48:32.256 --> 01:48:33.256
There.

1400
01:48:34.091 --> 01:48:35.923
Beautiful. Come and get us.

1401
01:48:36.051 --> 01:48:40.261
Hurry up. We've only got a few minutes
before anybody knows we're gone.

1402
01:48:41.724 --> 01:48:43.635
Coming to get you.

1403
01:48:47.104 --> 01:48:51.143
Put your hands where I can see
them and step out of the van.

1404
01:48:51.859 --> 01:48:53.941
You too, midnight.

1405
01:49:16.425 --> 01:49:19.042
Bish, they've got
Crease and Mother.

1406
01:49:21.597 --> 01:49:22.962
Shit!

1407
01:49:25.893 --> 01:49:27.804
Whistler, you've got to do it.

1408
01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:29.847
Do what?

1409
01:49:30.147 --> 01:49:34.266
You gotta drive. I'll talk you through it.
Now, hurry.

1410
01:49:34.860 --> 01:49:36.396
Drive what?

1411
01:49:55.297 --> 01:49:56.412
Okay, Bish.

1412
01:49:56.507 --> 01:49:58.965
There's a gate
about 30 yards behind you.

1413
01:49:59.051 --> 01:50:01.383
<i>Put it in reverse and floor it.</i>

1414
01:50:03.013 --> 01:50:06.472
Did I ever tell you
why I had to leave the CIA?

1415
01:50:07.017 --> 01:50:08.428
No.

1416
01:50:13.232 --> 01:50:14.688
What's reverse?

1417
01:50:15.526 --> 01:50:16.982
One down.

1418
01:50:17.569 --> 01:50:19.185
My temper.

1419
01:50:24.743 --> 01:50:25.743
Wow!

1420
01:50:25.828 --> 01:50:28.661
Motherfuckers mess with me,
I'll split your head!

1421
01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:32.870
Crease, where's Whistler going?

1422
01:50:34.545 --> 01:50:37.378
Bish? I'm going backwards.

1423
01:50:37.464 --> 01:50:39.705
You're doing fine. Doing fine.

1424
01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:45.670
Now, hit the brakes! Now!

1425
01:50:48.308 --> 01:50:51.551
Okay, put the gearshift down
two notches.

1426
01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:53.477
Down two notches.

1427
01:50:55.732 --> 01:50:57.439
<i>Turn left. Floor it.</i>

1428
01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:00.976
I'm going forward.

1429
01:51:01.071 --> 01:51:02.903
Do... Straighten out.

1430
01:51:06.118 --> 01:51:07.199
Oh, what was that?

1431
01:51:07.286 --> 01:51:09.197
Okay, keep coming.

1432
01:51:09.955 --> 01:51:12.538
Oh, God, I'm driving!
I'm driving!

1433
01:51:15.586 --> 01:51:18.704
No, don't do that.
I'm driving!

1434
01:51:23.302 --> 01:51:24.667
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Go left!

1435
01:51:25.846 --> 01:51:27.803
My... My left. Right.

1436
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:29.597
Go right! Right!

1437
01:51:34.479 --> 01:51:35.810
It's okay.

1438
01:51:38.775 --> 01:51:41.608
Beautiful! Keep coming.
Keep coming.

1439
01:51:41.695 --> 01:51:45.404
Now, you're gonna go down
a very gentle slope.

1440
01:51:45.741 --> 01:51:47.778
Okay, fine. Great. No problem.

1441
01:51:49.494 --> 01:51:50.575
Oh boy!

1442
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:58.333
Doing okay.
Five more seconds and stop.

1443
01:52:03.759 --> 01:52:06.000
I think I'll stop right here.

1444
01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:10.220
Whistler, that was great!

1445
01:52:10.307 --> 01:52:12.173
Whistler!
That was great!

1446
01:52:12.267 --> 01:52:14.804
I'm taking the wheel.
In the back.

1447
01:52:15.062 --> 01:52:17.019
Where's Martin?

1448
01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:21.978
Marty.

1449
01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:27.817
Would you step away
from the ladder?

1450
01:52:46.885 --> 01:52:52.005
You will give me the box right
now, or I will kill you right now.

1451
01:52:56.353 --> 01:52:57.639
No.

1452
01:53:00.274 --> 01:53:01.480
Jesus!

1453
01:53:01.566 --> 01:53:04.228
Just give me the box, Marty.

1454
01:53:04.361 --> 01:53:07.399
I thought you couldn't kill your
friend, Cos. I missed on purpose!

1455
01:53:07.531 --> 01:53:11.195
Give me the box. Take the goddamn thing!
I don't want it.

1456
01:53:11.285 --> 01:53:14.027
You win, I lose. That's
what you want, isn't it?

1457
01:53:14.121 --> 01:53:15.577
Say it! Say it!

1458
01:53:15.664 --> 01:53:16.779
Yes!

1459
01:53:22.379 --> 01:53:23.790
I'm sorry, Cos.

1460
01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:25.712
You could have shared this
with me.

1461
01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:28.291
I know. You could
have had the power.

1462
01:53:28.385 --> 01:53:29.420
I don't want it.

1463
01:53:29.511 --> 01:53:31.798
Don't you know the places
we can go with this?

1464
01:53:31.888 --> 01:53:33.970
Yeah, I do.
There's nobody there.

1465
01:53:34.057 --> 01:53:35.388
Exactly.

1466
01:53:36.143 --> 01:53:39.135
The world isn't run by weapons
anymore, or energy or money.

1467
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:41.937
It's run by little ones and
zeroes, little bits of data.

1468
01:53:42.024 --> 01:53:43.514
It's all just electrons.

1469
01:53:43.608 --> 01:53:45.394
I don't care.

1470
01:53:45.819 --> 01:53:48.481
I don't expect other people
to understand this,

1471
01:53:48.572 --> 01:53:54.238
but I do expect you to understand this.
We started this journey together.

1472
01:53:54.328 --> 01:53:59.164
It wasn't a journey, Cos.
It was a prank.

1473
01:54:00.459 --> 01:54:04.043
There's a war out there,
old friend, a world war.

1474
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:06.166
And it's not about
who's got the most bullets.

1475
01:54:06.256 --> 01:54:08.338
It's about
who controls the information,

1476
01:54:08.425 --> 01:54:11.338
what we see and hear,
how we work, what we think.

1477
01:54:11.428 --> 01:54:14.716
It's all about the information.

1478
01:54:14.806 --> 01:54:17.639
If I were you,
I'd destroy that thing.

1479
01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:21.552
Don't go.

1480
01:54:26.276 --> 01:54:27.687
Don't go.

1481
01:54:33.158 --> 01:54:35.650
You do what you have to do, Cos.

1482
01:54:36.787 --> 01:54:41.076
But if you want to stop me,
you'll have to pull the trigger.

1483
01:54:43.585 --> 01:54:44.700
You.

1484
01:55:37.848 --> 01:55:40.761
I can't believe
we actually made it back.

1485
01:55:40.851 --> 01:55:43.593
I can't believe we pulled off
the greatest sneak in history,

1486
01:55:43.687 --> 01:55:44.927
and we can't tell anybody.

1487
01:55:45.021 --> 01:55:48.264
You know what I can't believe?
Tomorrow's Thursday!

1488
01:55:48.358 --> 01:55:49.393
Not one word.

1489
01:55:49.484 --> 01:55:51.441
All of you, step over here.

1490
01:55:51.528 --> 01:55:53.735
Hands over your head. Move!

1491
01:55:53.822 --> 01:55:56.063
Move!

1492
01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.527
Mr. Bishop.

1493
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:12.004
I'm Bernard Abbott,
National Security Agency.

1494
01:56:12.883 --> 01:56:15.716
We spoke on the phone.

1495
01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:19.921
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1496
01:56:23.059 --> 01:56:28.645
It's interesting, don't you think,
you guys, that the NSA is here?

1497
01:56:28.732 --> 01:56:31.599
I thought the FBI was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1498
01:56:31.693 --> 01:56:35.482
Absolutely. This is outside
the NSA's jurisdiction.

1499
01:56:35.572 --> 01:56:40.237
Unless the NSA didn't want anybody to
know about Janek's little black box.

1500
01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:43.319
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

1501
01:56:43.413 --> 01:56:47.327
He said our codes were based on an entirely
different system than the Russian codes,

1502
01:56:47.417 --> 01:56:51.752
so this box
really wouldn't work on them.

1503
01:56:51.922 --> 01:56:55.256
The only thing it would really be
good for is spying on Americans.

1504
01:56:55.342 --> 01:56:58.460
Sure, with a box like that they
could read the FBI's mail.

1505
01:56:58.553 --> 01:57:02.296
Or the CIA's.
Or the White House's.

1506
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:06.179
No wonder they don't want to
share with the other children.

1507
01:57:07.312 --> 01:57:10.430
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

1508
01:57:10.774 --> 01:57:14.483
Clear up my record.
Get out of my life.

1509
01:57:14.569 --> 01:57:17.061
I don't have much choice, do I?

1510
01:57:17.155 --> 01:57:20.944
Not unless you wanna
read about it in Newsweek.

1511
01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:23.612
Deal. The box.

1512
01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:25.364
Not so fast.

1513
01:57:27.958 --> 01:57:29.699
I want a Winnebago.

1514
01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:30.828
What?

1515
01:57:30.919 --> 01:57:35.413
Fully equipped, big kitchen,
water bed, microwave.

1516
01:57:35.507 --> 01:57:37.589
This is not
a car dealership, pal.

1517
01:57:37.676 --> 01:57:39.633
He wants a Winnebago.

1518
01:57:44.599 --> 01:57:46.886
All right, a Winnebago.

1519
01:57:46.977 --> 01:57:49.389
Thank you. Burgundy interior.

1520
01:57:51.106 --> 01:57:52.517
Now the box.

1521
01:57:54.067 --> 01:57:57.810
I have never taken my wife
to Europe.

1522
01:57:58.572 --> 01:58:01.439
I'm sorry to hear it.
Give me the box.

1523
01:58:01.658 --> 01:58:04.696
You will buy me two round-trip,
first-class tickets

1524
01:58:04.786 --> 01:58:09.826
to Athens, Lisbon,
Madrid and Scotland.

1525
01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:12.078
Don't forget Tahiti.

1526
01:58:12.836 --> 01:58:14.076
And Tahiti.

1527
01:58:14.170 --> 01:58:15.660
Tahiti is not in Europe.

1528
01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:17.120
Excuse me.

1529
01:58:17.716 --> 01:58:19.819
When you get the box, then you
give <i>us</i> geography lessons.

1530
01:58:19.843 --> 01:58:22.551
Until then,
this man goes to Tahiti.

1531
01:58:23.888 --> 01:58:26.846
Fine! Tahiti!

1532
01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.016
Carl?

1533
01:58:30.979 --> 01:58:35.018
The young lady
with the Uzi, is she single?

1534
01:58:35.108 --> 01:58:37.691
Carl. Excuse us.

1535
01:58:40.155 --> 01:58:44.444
This is the brass ring. You
gotta think bigger thoughts.

1536
01:58:44.534 --> 01:58:47.652
I just want her
telephone number.

1537
01:58:49.372 --> 01:58:51.579
Please?

1538
01:58:53.835 --> 01:58:56.293
No. How about a lunch?
You can chaperon.

1539
01:58:56.379 --> 01:58:58.120
I will not do this.

1540
01:58:58.715 --> 01:59:01.047
Hey, Abby, come on.

1541
01:59:01.134 --> 01:59:03.842
The FBI'd give him twins.
No!

1542
01:59:03.928 --> 01:59:06.169
Wait a second.

1543
01:59:07.724 --> 01:59:12.309
You can have anything you want, and
you're asking for my phone number?

1544
01:59:13.229 --> 01:59:14.435
Yes.

1545
01:59:16.191 --> 01:59:21.186
273-9164. Area code 415.

1546
01:59:23.281 --> 01:59:25.648
I'm Carl.
I'm Mary.

1547
01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:27.699
I'm going to be sick.

1548
01:59:27.786 --> 01:59:31.279
Are we done here?
Not yet. Whistler.

1549
01:59:34.292 --> 01:59:37.000
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1550
01:59:37.087 --> 01:59:38.828
This is ridiculous.

1551
01:59:38.922 --> 01:59:40.378
He's serious.

1552
01:59:40.465 --> 01:59:42.957
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1553
01:59:43.051 --> 01:59:47.136
We are the United States government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1554
01:59:47.222 --> 01:59:49.259
You're just gonna have to try.

1555
01:59:50.225 --> 01:59:53.388
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

1556
01:59:53.812 --> 01:59:58.181
Thank you very much.
That's all I ask.

1557
02:00:00.568 --> 02:00:02.900
How about you?
What do you want?

1558
02:00:02.987 --> 02:00:04.773
Oh, I'm fine.

1559
02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:11.155
May I have the box?

1560
02:00:21.464 --> 02:00:24.798
You know it doesn't work.
It never did.

1561
02:00:25.343 --> 02:00:27.129
That's not important, is it?

1562
02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:31.179
What's really important is that
none of this ever happened.

1563
02:00:31.266 --> 02:00:34.133
This box doesn't exist.

1564
02:00:35.729 --> 02:00:37.640
I never saw it before.

1565
02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:39.313
Remember that.

1566
02:00:49.409 --> 02:00:50.820
Bishop?

1567
02:00:51.953 --> 02:00:54.786
All you did
was say it was broken.

1568
02:00:55.999 --> 02:01:00.368
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

1569
02:01:03.047 --> 02:01:04.458
Nope.

1570
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:06.756
<i>In a surprise announcement,</i>

1571
02:01:06.843 --> 02:01:10.336
<i>the Republican National Committee
has revealed it is bankrupt.</i>

1572
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:14.424
<i>A spokesman for the party said they had
plenty of money in their accounts last week,</i>

1573
02:01:14.517 --> 02:01:17.805
<i>but today they just don't know
where the money has gone.</i>

1574
02:01:17.896 --> 02:01:19.682
<i>But not everybody's
going begging.</i>

1575
02:01:19.773 --> 02:01:23.516
<i>Amnesty International, Greenpeace,
and the United Negro College Fund</i>

1576
02:01:23.610 --> 02:01:29.276
<i>announced record earnings this week, due
mostly to large, anonymous donations.</i>
