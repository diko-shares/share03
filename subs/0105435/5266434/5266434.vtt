COSMO: What'd we just do?

4
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.820
The Republican Party just made a
generous donation to the Black Panthers.

Farm out. Right arm.

Richard Nixon's personal

Ooh, this is a challenge.

9
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.300
Marty, we have to find somebody
truly worthy to give his money to.

10
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.600
How about...

11
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.970
The National Association
to Legalize Marijuana.

12
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.890
Perfect.
How much should he give?

13
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.970
He's a generous man. I'd say, all he's got.
God, I'm hungry!

14
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.180
Marty, you are sure we will not
get into trouble for this?

has too much money.

Oh, good one. Consequence?

19
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.630
They're corrupt. Result?

20
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.000
The system perpetuates itself
at the expense of the people.

to donate some money.

Marty.

Before we begin, there's

Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-law enforcement types.

134

But your team, it's...

135
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.050

Darryl Roskow,
also known as "Mother."

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.610
Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

139
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:26.280
Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

143
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.290

144
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.710
Irwin Emery,
also known as "Whistler."

145
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:44.130

problem with the phone company.

146
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.930
Sixty-two counts?

147
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.180
Okay, you want law enforcement?

148
00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.430
How about Donald Crease? Twenty-two
year veteran of the CIA.

149
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.680
Terminated, 1987. Why was that?

150
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.140
I don't know. I think maybe
a personality conflict.

151
00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.310
Who are you guys?

152
00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.640
Relax, Marty. We have to
check on these things.

153
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.780
It's just everybody on your team has had
some sort of problem in their past.

154
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.700
And then there's Martin Bishop.

155
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.860
He doesn't seem to have a past.

156
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.160

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.220
Oh, you're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

160
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.520
No, that's the FBI. We're not
chartered for domestic surveillance.

161
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:38.720
Oh, I see. You just overthrow
governments, set up friendly dictators.

162
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.680
No, that's the CIA.

163

the other fellow's codes.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.770
We're the good guys, Marty.

166
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.320
Gee, I can't tell you
what a relief that is, Dick.

167
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.240
All right, that's enough.
Let's go.

168
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.370
If you change your mind
call us at this number...

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.290
Mr. Brice.

170
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.660
Help me out?

171
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.750
Spare a quarter? Help me out. The
government's taken away my home.

172
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:49.630
Talk to him.

173
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.390
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

174
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.980
You know, I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

175
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.860
Hey, hey, we're all friends here, right?
Easy, easy.

176
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.700
Want some coffee or something?

177
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.030
No.

178
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.910
Buddy, is that Janek's file?

179
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.110
Yeah, Janek's file.

180
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.790
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

181
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.090
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

182
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.510
Specializes in large number
theory, prime numbers, factoring.

183
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.300
Cryptography. Very good.

184
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.630
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

185
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.680
Way out of profile
for a guy like that.

186
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.130
It's our job to be curious,
so we traced the money.

187
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.810
Guess where it comes from?

188
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.600
I know you're not gonna say Russia.
Yeah.

189
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.180
Give me a break.

190
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.520
We won, they lost, you know?
It's been in a couple of papers.

191
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.900
Yeah, we still spy on them.
They still spy on us.

192
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.650
We intercepted a fax
last week. Here.

193
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.900
They're making some kind of box,
a little black box.

194
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.030
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

195
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.080
Security technology...
Sensor techniques, who knows?

196
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:04.200
It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

197
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.160
Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

198
00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.250
Yeah. No way.

199
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.800
Sorry, Marty. We don't
have a lot of choice here.

200
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.510
Do it yourself.

201
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.550
We can't. Why not?

202
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.180
By law, we're not allowed or equipped
to do this kind of operation.

203
00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.510
Then get the FBI.

204
00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:24.690
Yeah, right, the FBI.

205
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.360
The FBI can't work for us without
approval from a congressional committee.

206
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:30.400
We don't have the time.
So, why me?

207
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.520
Frankly, because we...

208
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.100
Yeah, frankly.

209
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:36.780
Marty, sit down, please.

210
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.950
Frankly, because
it's kind of illegal.

211
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.080
You've managed to stay
underground more than 20 years.

212
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.580
You know how not to get caught.

213
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.380
We know you can
keep your mouth shut.

214
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.330
Job pays $175,000,
payable on delivery.

215
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.790
You can distribute it
among the poor, if you like.

216
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.050
Pass.

217
00:16:57.130 --> 00:16:58.500
We also clean up your record.

218
00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.340
Quash the outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

219
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.430
Your pal Cosmo got 12 years, and that was
without flight to evade prosecution.

220
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.730
We all know what happened
to him in there.

221
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.650
If I say no?

222
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.940
Don't say no.

223
00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.230
What good would you do
anybody in prison?

224
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.080
I don't believe this. You
lied to us all these years.

225
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.250
Even lied to us about your name.

226
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320
Sorry, okay?

227
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.910
I'm sorry, but when you're
wanted by the feds,

228
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.210
you don't go around
telling everybody.

229
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.590
We're not everybody, Martin. We're
your partners. You tell us.

230
00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.010
Fine.

231
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.220
Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

232
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.840
We all have our little
secrets, don't we?

233
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.560
Look, you guys have
a decision to make.

234
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.350
This is not a test. The penetration
is live. The target is unaware.

235
00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.530
Sneaking a foreign intelligence
service that might kill us

236
00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.730
to keep us out
is not what we do.

237
00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.070
The probable level of security
is very low.

238
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.780
But if you guys don't want to take that
chance just to keep me out of jail...

239
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.870
Fine. I understand. Don't do it.

240
00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.420
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

241
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.120
I don't care if you go to jail.

242
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.960
Me neither. I'm in.

243
00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.680
Could we maybe just go back to
the "they might kill us" part?

244
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.180
If I thought
that was likely to happen,

245
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.430
I wouldn't bring this to you.

246
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:26.630
But there is a risk.

247
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.190
It pays $175,000!

248
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:32.980
I'm in.

249
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:42.950
You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.
All right. What do we need?

250
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.660
Okay. We start with a very light
surveillance. Level three.

251
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.530
First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

252
00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.160
Now, this guy's giving a lecture
tomorrow at U.C. in the afternoon.

253
00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.500
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

254
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.460
Okay, let's do it.

255
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.920
For the lecture, you wanna take
Whistler or do you want me?

256
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.470
No, that's okay.
I thought I'd ask Liz.

(PIANO PLAYING WALTZ)

258
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.220
Who's this?

259
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.310
Sort of an old friend.

260
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.310
Practice! Practice, practice!

261
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.470
(LAUGHS)

262
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480
Hi.

263
00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.480
We're not getting back together.

264
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.360
Did I say anything? You will.

265
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.160
I'm here on business, Liz.

266
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.830
Bishop,
you don't have a business.

267
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.250
You have a club.
It's a boys' club.

268
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.540
You have a little clubhouse. You
probably have a secret handshake.

269
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.240
Liz, I need your help.

270
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.250
I will not be dragged back
into your world.

271
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.380
I have a new group
of gifted children now,

272
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.460
and I like the fact
that they're under 30.

273
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.590
Excuse me.

274
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.470
There's a mathematician named Gunter Janek.
You know him?

275
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.470
I've read him. Now go away.

276
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.300
He's giving a master lecture
at 3:30...

277
00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.100
How nice for him.

278
00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.600
I thought I'd buy you
dinner after.

279
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.100
I am not going out with you.

280
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.440
This isn't a date, dummy. This is a
scientific exploration, a tutorial.

281
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.360
I need you...

282
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.030
To explain it to me.

283
00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.820
Read a book.

284
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.490
They found me, Liz.

285
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.080
The government found me.

286
00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.630
They offered me a deal. If I take
their offer, they clear my record,

287
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.880
and I can get my name back.

288
00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:18.310
You and I
are not getting back together.

289
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.610
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

290
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.730
Pick me up at 3:00.

291
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.280
Yes!

292
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.290
While the number field sieve is
the best method currently known,

293
00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:38.660
there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

294
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.000
This guy's good.

295
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.080
Shh!

296
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.220
...over the rationals and, hence,
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

297
00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:50.590
Using the Artin map, we might
induce homomorphisms...

298
00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.970
You seeing anybody? Shh!

299
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.900
These maps could then be used to combine
splitting information from all the...

300
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.270
This isn't just about large number theory.
It's about cryptography.

301
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.690
Oh? You mean codes?

302
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.950
I mean unbreakable codes.

303
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.660
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions,

304
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:21.340
and allow us to acquire the solution in
a dramatically more efficient manner.

305
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.290
Are you seeing... Shh!

306
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.210
Such an approach
is purely theoretical.

307
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.840
So far, no one has been able
to accomplish

308
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.170
such constructions yet.

309
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.340
(CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYING) The
numbers are so unbelievably big,

310
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.430
all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

311
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.690
But maybe,
just maybe there's a shortcut.

he's found it.

If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

314
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.870
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools.

Maybe able to see things in
other numbers that we can't.

how wonderful to see you.

your scientists' new secrets.

Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

see you back together again.

Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

No! No, no, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

521
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.010
Get a hold of yourself.

522
00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.380
You gotta not tell him you know.
Ha!

523
00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.270
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

524
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.440
You don't know anything
about a wife.

525
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.110
You just give me
one good reason why.

526
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.610
All right,
I'll give you a reason.

527
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:43.700
Give you a really good reason.

528
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.870
It's just what she would
want you to do.

529
00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.040
It's just what she
wants you to do.

530
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:54.870
I don't understand.

531
00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:58.970
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

532
00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.970
Here, look, I might lose
my license for this.

533
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.310
My client is a vindictive,
bitter woman.

534
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.480
She's been withholding marital
favors from Gunter for years,

535
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.140
and now she's out to ruin him.

536
00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.560
(STAMMERING) And she's
using you to get to her.

537
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.860
And she's using
me to get to you.

538
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.780
I know that's confusing, but don't
you see what's happening here?

539
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.150
You and me, we're just pawns
in this ugly little game.

540
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:25.330
Pawns.

541
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.410
If you love him...

542
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:37.250
If you really love him...

543
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.760
Then just keep on loving him.

544
00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:42.670
And never let him know

545
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.430
that you know what he thinks
you don't know you know.

546
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.630
You know?

547
00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.770
And give him head
whenever he wants.

548
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.390
Give him help.

549
00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.610
Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.
Can you do that for Gunter?

550
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.980
Yes, yes, I can, I can.

551
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.490
Okay, good.

552
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.120
Now get out of here.

553
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.620
Give him head?

554
00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:20.960
Be a beacon?

555
00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.720
(CHAIN OF FOOLS
BY ARETHA FRANKLIN PLAYING)

556
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:26.300
<i>(SINGING) Chain, chain, chain
chain, chain, chain.</i>

557
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:34.560
<i>Chain, chain, chain
chain, chain, chain.</i>

558
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.610
<i>Chain of fools.</i>

559
00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.400
<i>For five long years.</i>

560
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.860
<i>I thought you were my man.</i>

561
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.320
<i>But I found out.</i>

562
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:55.160
<i>I'm just a link
in your chain, oh.</i>

563
00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.080
But the key meeting
took place July 1, 1958,

564
00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.580
when the Air Force brought this
space visitor to the White House

565
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:02.880
for an interview with President Eisenhower.
And Ike said,

566
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.580
"Look, give us your technology."

567
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.170
"We'll give you all
the cow lips you want."

568
00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:09.130
Don't listen to this man.
He's certifiable.

569
00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.140
Your husband knows about cattle
mutilations. He's ex-CIA.

570
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:12.260
He's touched.

571
00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:14.510
He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

572
00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:16.940
Understood, understood.

573
00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.980
One thing I don't quite get
though is you and Cosmo,

574
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.610
you were taking all these
chances, all these big chances,

575
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:26.570
what for?

576
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.320
We were young.
And there was a war on.

577
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.450
It was a good way to meet girls.

578
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:37.700
I bet.

579
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:41.040
How come you didn't get caught?

580
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.250
I went out for pizza.

581
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.000
Then I went to Canada.

582
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.220
I was lucky. He wasn't.

583
00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.930
Did he ever forgive you?

584
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:56.850
I hope so.

585
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:59.890
He died in prison.

586
00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:12.080
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

587
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.650
Don?

588
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:18.620
Well, we have never been
to Europe together.

589
00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.700
That's right.

590
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.830
And we are going.

591
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.750
Madrid, Lisbon.

592
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.830
Athens. Oh, and Scotland.

593
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.130
And Tahiti.

594
00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.880
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

595
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.420
Mother?

596
00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.050
Well, you know, I've never
actually had a really cool car

597
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.640
that I could
fit comfortably into.

598
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.640
So I think
I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago

599
00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:45.270
with a big kitchen,
water bed, big kitchen.

600
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.440
Carl?

601
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.400
I'd like to have a deep
relationship with a beautiful woman

602
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.280
who melts from the very
first time our eyes meet.

603
00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.290
We're not
getting paid that much, Carl.

604
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.250
Well, you know,
someone like Liz.

605
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.660
You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

606
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:05.830
ALL: Ooh! Uh-oh.

607
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.630
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

608
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.420
Whistler?

609
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.350
Peace on earth,
goodwill toward men.

610
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.720
MOTHER; Right On.

611
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.470
And women.

612
00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:18.510
MOTHER: Hear, hear!

613
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:25.770
That's not a word, "scrunchy".

614
00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:27.230
Scrunchy is not a word.

615
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.980
Scrunchy is a word.

616
00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.150
Since when? You know what
happens to your face?

617
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.870
Please, it's not a word. Right
now your face is scrunchy.

618
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.940
CREASE: All right.
We gotta take it as a word.

619
00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.420
LIZ:
It's better than "scrunchy."

620
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:48.670
BISHOP:
I didn't invent the word.

621
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.670
Carl. Yes.

622
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.420
What does it say where this is?

623
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.680
Hold on a second here.

624
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.050
"System out."

625
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:07.100
Guys, I really think you
should leave that thing alone.

626
00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:12.690
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to
see something. Don't worry, Don.

627
00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.780
How are they spelling Setec?

628
00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.950
S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

629
00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.240
Special extraterrestrial?

630
00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:24.420
Earthling counter.

631
00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.910
Does that make two, four, five.

632
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.540
And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around

633
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:37.100
and looks at me,
like right dead in my eyes.

634
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.390
Setec.

635
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.810
What?

636
00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.880
Setec Astronomy.

637
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.850
I just love it
when a man says that to me.

638
00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.270
Setec doesn't mean anything.

639
00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.070
Excuse me...

640
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:27.560
Carl, can you get me some cable
and that IO interface, please?

641
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.200
"Monterey's Coast."

642
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.450
Does "Monterey's Coast"
mean anything to you guys?

643
00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.620
No.

644
00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.550
Here, help me with this.

645
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.130
Carl, get the diagnostics.

646
00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:14.650
How about "My Socrates Note"?

647
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.560
No.

648
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:18.860
Uh-uh.

649
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.160
No, I...

650
00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:34.500
No. No.

651
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.180
Uh-huh. Got it.
Move to another one.

652
00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.030
Mmm-hmm. Give me another one.

653
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.990
Stay in that quadrant.

654
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:16.300
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

655
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:18.870
Whoa.

656
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.460
Mother, what was that?
Go back one.

657
00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:23.920
MOTHER: All right.

658
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:27.550
Holy cow.

659
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:31.810
What the hell is this?

660
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.330
"Too Many Secrets."

661
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:57.630
Bish, I think you
better come over here.

662
00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.120
Carl, got your
little black book?

663
00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:01.250
Yes.

664
00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:05.090
Give me the number for something
impossible to access.

665
00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:08.840
Okay. What about this?

666
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.350
Federal Reserve transfer node,
Culpeper, Virginia.

667
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:12.520
Yeah, sure. Good luck.

668
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.690
CARL: Nine hundred billion
a day goes through there.

669
00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.810
That'll do. Punch it in.

670
00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.770
Okay-

671
00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.990
We won't get in. It's encrypted.

672
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.790
CARL: See?

673
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.580
Mother, that last contact.

674
00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:44.960
WHISTLER: Look at this, boys.

675
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.470
Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

676
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.180
Hey, don't screw around
with that thing!

677
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.310
Wait, Crease.

678
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.350
Carl, what else you got?

679
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.810
National power grid?

680
00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:58.140
(CHUCKLES)

681
00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:00.820
Okay-

682
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.450
Here we come.

683
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:09.580
Okay, Mother.

684
00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:10.900
Probing.

685
00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.540
Wow. Unbelievable.

686
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.540
WHISTLER: Anybody want to
black out New England?

687
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Carl, what else?

688
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.710
Air traffic control system.

689
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.260
(TYPING)

690
00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.140
Okay, Mother.

691
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.190
Oh, my God.

692
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.450
CREASE: How is this possible?

693
00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.950
Cryptography systems are based on
mathematical problems so complex

694
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:54.450
they cannot be solved
without a key.

695
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:58.160
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key,

696
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.790
and he hard-wired it
into that chip.

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:31.240
The whole network is protected by
a very powerful encryption system

877
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.320
so the government
cannot read it.

878
01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:36.580
But if the feds
get Janek's box...

879
01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:42.380
Disaster. Therefore,
we must have it.

880
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.130
To protect the organization.

881
01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:46.500
Yes.

882
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:51.300
No, I don't buy it.

883
01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:54.730
I know you.

884
01:02:56.890 --> 01:02:59.230
God, it's good to see you.

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.620
(WHISPERING) We were going to
change the world, Marty, remember?

886
01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:19.800
Did you ever get around to actually
doing it? No, I guess not.

887
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:22.040
Well, I think I can.

888
01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.590
Really.

889
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:24.760
Yes.

890
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:34.010
What's wrong with this country, Marty?
Money. You taught me that.

891
01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.270
Evil defense contractors
had it, noble causes did not.

892
01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:42.850
Politicians are bought and sold like so
much chattel. Our problems multiply.

893
01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:46.560
Pollution, crime, drugs, poverty,
disease, hunger, despair.

894
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:49.740
We throw gobs of money at them.

895
01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.200
The problems always get worse.
Why is that?

896
01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.870
Because money's most powerful
ability is to allow bad people

897
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:59.870
to continue doing bad things at the
expense of those who don't have it.

898
01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:02.370
I agree. Who did you say
you were working for?

899
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:04.580
That's just my day job.

900
01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:08.290
Listen, when I was in prison, I learned
that everything in this world,

901
01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:11.050
including money,
operates not on reality...

902
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:13.430
But the perception of reality.

903
01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:20.310
Posit, people think a bank
might be financially shaky.

904
01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:22.560
Consequence, people start
to withdraw their money.

905
01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.610
Result, pretty soon,
it is financially shaky.

906
01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.730
Conclusion,
you can make banks fail.

907
01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:27.810
(BUZZING)

908
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:30.990

914
01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.090
I might even be able to crash
the whole damn system.

915
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.250
Destroy all records of ownership.
Think of it, Marty.

916
01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.930
No more rich people. No more poor people.
Everybody's the same.

917
01:04:55.010 --> 01:04:57.510
Isn't that what we said
we always wanted?

918
01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:01.560
Cos, you haven't gone crazy
on me, have you?

919
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.020
Who else is going to change
the world, Marty?

920
01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.020

921
01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.450

your fingerprints

from the gun that killed a
Russian consular officer.

924
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.420
The following day, those prints will
be run through an FBI computer,

925
01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.590
and they will come up
with a name.

926

trouble and who, I might add, did not.

928
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:48.110
Then they will check this
database in Washington, D.C.,

929
01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:51.110
which I'm now able to access,
thanks to you.

930

Martin Brice is, do they?

Scratch the Golden Gate.
That leaves three.

1049
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:29.780
What did it sound like?
Did you go through a tunnel?

1050
01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.150
I'm not... No.

1051
01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:34.530
Scratch the Bay.

1052
01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:36.860
That leaves two.
San Mateo and Dumbarton.

1053
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.120
What did it sound like?

1054
01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:44.790
<i>(WHOOSHING SOUND PLAYING)</i>

1055
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:46.460
Lower.

1056
01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:50.880
Lower.

1057
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.970
There was a recurring sound.

1058
01:13:59.550 --> 01:14:01.720
Like seams in the concrete.

1059
01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:09.730
<i>(CLUNKING SOUND PLAYING)</i>

1060
01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:13.230
But further apart.

1061
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:18.410
Yeah.

1062
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:38.010
MOTHER: Now what?

1063
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:40.310
Bumps. Rough ones.

1064
01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:43.050
Railroad tracks. Yeah, yeah.

1065
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:46.600
A right on Antrim
and a left on 84.

1066
01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.730
And then what did you hear?

1067
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:52.650
Cocktail party.

1068
01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:53.900
What?

1069
01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:03.660
Drove through what sounded... it
sounded like a cocktail party.

1070
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:06.750
There was chattering.
It was right at the end.

1071
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:09.370
Great. Now we got to look
for a cocktail party

1072
01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:11.250
on the other side
of the railroad track.

1073
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:14.630
What's the exit
where the railroad tracks are?

1074
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:15.840
Crescent.

1075
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.590
Mother, stay on Crescent,
get off at the reservoir.

1076
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.090
Okay-

1077
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:24.100
There's a cocktail party
at the reservoir?

1078
01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.470
Yeah. Yeah.

1079
01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:36.020
Very good, Bish. Remind me to make
you an honorary blind person.

1080
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:38.660
Great.

1081
01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:40.660
(GABBLING)

1082
01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.160
MOTHER: Where's this road go?

1083
01:15:44.610 --> 01:15:48.490
CARL: Nowhere. Looks like it
ends right around that hill.

1084
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:50.460
What's behind the hill?

1085
01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.830
Nothing. It's private property.

1086
01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:58.090
Private.

1087
01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.750
Forget it. It's a toy company.

1088
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:33.870
A toy company, my ass.
That's laser fencing.

1089
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
There's high voltage
on the perimeter.

1090
01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:38.630
The whole building says,
"Go away."

1091
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:42.430
It's Cosmo. I know it.
The toy company's a front.

1092
01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:46.970
Mother, get the directional.
Carl, get the video. Let's go.

1093
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:54.560
MOTHER: Second floor,
northwest two.

1094
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:56.980
That's a bathroom.

1095
01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:00.610
Second floor, northwest three.

1096
01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:03.990
Ah, it's an emergency exit.

1097
01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:05.610
How do you know that?

1098
01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:09.620
I can hear the emergency
floodlight batteries recharging.

1099
01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.000
Hold it right there.
Crease, what's this mean?

1100
01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:17.880
"My voice is my passport.
Verify me"?

1101
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.420
Some sort of voiceprint l.D.
I'll check it out.

1102
01:17:26.170 --> 01:17:28.020
What am I listening to now,
Mother?

1103
01:17:28.090 --> 01:17:30.840
Third floor, southwest corner.

1104
01:17:30.970 --> 01:17:33.810
Oh, it's bursting
with ultrasonic.

1105
01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:36.730
I've never heard sensors
that powerful before.

1106
01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:41.490
Bish, someone is very serious about
keeping people out of that room.

1107
01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.240
Yeah.

1108
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:49.450
Okay-

1109
01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.170
MOTHER: Okay, there's the corner room
with the motion detectors Whistler heard.

1110
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.920
BISHOP: That's Cosmo's
office. I saw the sensors.

1111
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.630
They keep the lights
on all night,

1112
01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:05.710
so we have to assume
the sensors are on too.

1113
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.260
It won't be easy
getting in there.

1114
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:11.060
Run this on ahead. Let's figure
out who works next door.

1115
01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:17.600
It's fascinating what 50 bucks can get
you at the county recorder's office.

1116
01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.310
What do you got?

1117
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:21.280
PlayTronics'
corporate headquarters.

1118
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:23.070
The complete blueprints.

1119
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:25.370
Not bad. Not bad, Carl.

1120
01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.940
Oh, thanks.

1121
01:18:28.150 --> 01:18:29.490
Where'd you get the 50 bucks?

1122
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:31.570
I took it from Mother's wallet.

1123
01:18:31.650 --> 01:18:32.950
Good.

1124
01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:37.170
No, Mom, today's not a good
day to come over. No...

1125
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:39.920
Okay, what have we got here?

1126
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.840
It's called a mantrap. I borrowed
this demo from the manufacturer.

1127
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.890
It's a digital voice-recognition
monitor hooked up to an access booth.

1128
01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.680
NSA uses the same technology

1129
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.260
to keep people out of
restricted areas at Fort Meade.

1130
01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.600
Card?

1131
01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:01.020
Now speak right into this box.

1132
01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:03.070
Hi.

1133
01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.610
My name is Martin Bishop.

1134
01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:08.740
My voice is my passport.
Verify me.

1135
01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:12.540
WHISTLER:
And you can't pass through

1136
01:19:12.610 --> 01:19:15.370
unless your voiceprint matches
the one encoded on the card.

1137
01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:18.790
So we need someone's card.
And their voice.

1138
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:20.290
Can we beat this with tape?

1139
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:22.250
Has to be up close and personal.

1140
01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:25.300
Otherwise you'll be caught
in a steel-reinforced booth

1141
01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.800
while the guards
with the shotguns are called.

1142
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.090
Ah, that's great.

1143
01:19:29.170 --> 01:19:30.920
Really great.
What about motion detectors?

1144
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:35.230
I'm picking one up this afternoon.
That makes beating this look easy.

1145
01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:39.560
MOTHER: Hey, Bish,
I think we've found our guy.

1146
01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:44.860
Okay, I've blown up the image a little.
Here's the room next to Cosmo's.

1147
01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:48.490
Now it's the end of the day.
Watch who comes out.

1148
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.070
Let me zoom in
on the front door.

1149
01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:56.280
A lady in a green skirt
and this guy with the cap.

1150
01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:01.000
Nobody comes out for another 18 minutes.
So it's one of those two.

1151
01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:04.670
Right. Here's the next evening.
Again...

1152
01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.970
The office next to Cosmo's.
Lights go out.

1153
01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:13.260
The guy in the cap.

1154
01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:14.560
Anybody else?

1155
01:20:14.630 --> 01:20:18.640
Nobody else comes out for 22 minutes.
That's who works next door.

1156
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.650
We'll use his office to get into Cosmo's.
Can we get plates?

1157
01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.270
Let me see.

1158
01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:28.360
Zooming in.

1159
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:32.570
Another bump. Enhancing.

1160
01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.910
There's your plate. 180 IQ.

1161
01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:44.750
Cute. All right. Carl,
let's do this guy.

1162
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.710
His name's Werner Brandes.

1163
01:20:47.790 --> 01:20:51.170
Single, 6'1", 174 pounds,
must wear glasses to drive,

1164
01:20:51.250 --> 01:20:53.050
no outstanding
tickets or warrants.

1165
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.130
CARL: He leaves work between
6:00 and 7:00 every night,

1166
01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:59.720
takes the same route home,
he obeys the speed limit,

1167
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:04.020
comes to a complete stop at every stop
sign and signals when he changes lanes.

1168
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.390
He's a very safe driver.

1169
01:21:06.930 --> 01:21:13.360
CREASE: $750 limit on his Visa, pays his
bills, no bad debts, no bum checks.

Member, International Microchip
Designers Association

1172
01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.960
and chairman
of the social committee.

1173
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:24.160
Great. The world's most
boring human.

1174
01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:26.710
How the hell are we going to get
close enough to record him?

01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:27.790
(RUSTLING)

1176
01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.050
Oh, Mother.

1177
01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:37.300
Sorry, Liz. Standard procedure.
Trash from the guy's house.

1178
01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.600
And thank you
for bringing it into mine.

1179
01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:51.310
BISHOP: Okay, let's see here. Phone bill,
no long distance. Club Med brochure.

1180
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:56.360
A ticket stub
to a Barry Manilow concert.

1181
01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.110
Here it is. Here we go.

1182
01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:05.750
"Dear Compudater. Welcome to the
world of automated compatibility."

1183
01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:08.500
He's a computer dater.

1184
01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.630
I love it. Let's get him a date.

1185
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:14.510
What was the name of that girl that we used
on the cereal company sneak last year?

1186
01:22:14.590 --> 01:22:17.590
Sandy Krieger?
Forget it. Married a cop.

1187
01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:21.760
How about Barbara?
Now, she was cute.

1188
01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.060
Yeah, but she'd never do it. She
regards this work as juvenfle.

1189
01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.560
That's why she divorced me.
How about your friend Jessie?

1190
01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:31.610
Yeah, she's buff. Fellows...

1191
01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:37.160
Fellows, look at this man's trash.
He's not looking for buff.

1192
01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:39.830
It's the nicest garbage
I've ever seen.

1193
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.870
The man who folded
this tube of Crest

1194
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:45.200
is looking for someone
meticulous, refined...

1195
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:47.250
Anal.

1196
01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:54.250

Hi.

1200
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:24.870
Are you ready
for the dim sum bar?

1201
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:27.290
Oh, I'm not really in any hurry.

1202
01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:30.120
All right. I'll be right back.

1203
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:57.940
So. So.

1204
01:23:58.980 --> 01:24:04.160
What an interesting name you have.
How exactly do you pronounce it?

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:23.850
The best motion sensor
on the market.

1208
01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.770
Watch this.

Oh, yeah.

We can wrap you in a full body suit

We spoke on the phone.

1559
01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:19.590
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1560
01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:28.270
It's interesting, don't you think,
you guys, that the NSA is here?

1561
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:31.220
I thought the FBI was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1562
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:35.110
Absolutely. This is outside
the NSA's jurisdiction.

1563
01:56:35.190 --> 01:56:39.860
Unless the NSA didn't want anybody to
know about Janek's little black box.

1564
01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:42.940
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

1565
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:46.950
He said our codes were based on an entirely
different system than the Russian codes,

1566
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:51.380
so this box
really wouldn't work on them.

1567
01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:54.880
The only thing it would really be
good for is spying on Americans.

1568
01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:58.080
Sure, with a box like that they
could read the FBl's mail.

1569
01:56:58.170 --> 01:57:01.920
Or the CIA's.
Or the White House's.

1570
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.800
No wonder they don't want to
share with the other children.

1571
01:57:06.970 --> 01:57:10.060
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

1572
01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:14.100
Clear up my record.
Get out of my life.

1573
01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:16.730
I don't have much choice, do I?

1574
01:57:16.810 --> 01:57:20.570
Not unless you wanna
read about it in Newsweek.

1575
01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:23.240
Deal. The box.

1576
01:57:23.320 --> 01:57:24.990
MOTHER: Not so fast.

1577
01:57:27.610 --> 01:57:29.330
I want a Winnebago.

1578
01:57:29.410 --> 01:57:30.450
What?

1579
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:35.080
Fully equipped, big kitchen,
water bed, microwave.

1580
01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:37.260
This is not
a car dealership, pal.

1581
01:57:37.330 --> 01:57:39.250
He wants a Winnebago.

1582
01:57:44.210 --> 01:57:46.560
All right, a Winnebago.

1583
01:57:46.630 --> 01:57:49.010
Thank you. Burgundy interior.

1584
01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:52.190
Now the box.

1585
01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:53.310
(CREASE CLEARING THROAT)

1586
01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:57.480
I have never taken my wife
to Europe.

1587
01:57:58.190 --> 01:58:01.060
I'm sorry to hear it.
Give me the box.

1588
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:04.320
You will buy me two round-trip,
first-class tickets

1589
01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:09.500
to Athens, Lisbon,
Madrid and Scotland.

1590
01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:11.700
Don't forget Tahiti.

1591
01:58:12.490 --> 01:58:13.740
And Tahiti.

1592
01:58:13.830 --> 01:58:15.290
Tahiti is not in Europe.

1593
01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:16.750
Excuse me.

1594
01:58:17.370 --> 01:58:19.420
When you get the box, then you
give us geography lessons.

1595
01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:22.220
Until then,
this man goes to Tahiti.

1596
01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:26.470
Fine! Tahiti!

1597
01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.680
Carl?

1598
01:58:30.590 --> 01:58:34.640
The young lady
with the Uzi, is she single?

1599
01:58:34.720 --> 01:58:37.350
Carl. Excuse us.

1600
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:44.110
This is the brass ring. You
gotta think bigger thoughts.

1601
01:58:44.190 --> 01:58:47.280
I just want her
telephone number.

1602
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:51.250
Please?

1603
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:55.950
How about a lunch? You
can chaperon. No.

1604
01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:57.750
I will not do this.

1605
01:58:58.330 --> 01:59:00.670
Hey, Abby, come on.

1606
01:59:00.750 --> 01:59:03.500
The FBl'd give him twins. No!

1607
01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:05.800
Wait a second.

1608
01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:11.940
You can have anything you want, and
you're asking for my phone number?

1609
01:59:12.890 --> 01:59:14.100
Yes.

1610
01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:20.810
273-9164. Area code 415.

1611
01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:25.280
I'm Carl. I'm Mary.

1612
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:27.360
I'm going to be sick.

1613
01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:30.950
ABBOTT: Are we done here?
Not yet. Whistler.

1614
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:36.670
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1615
01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:38.460
This is ridiculous.

1616
01:59:38.580 --> 01:59:40.050
He's serious.

1617
01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:42.590
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

1618
01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:46.760
We are the United States government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1619
01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:48.880
You're just gonna have to try.

1620
01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:53.010
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

1621
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:57.810
Thank you very much.
That's all I ask.

1622
02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.560
How about you? What do you want?

1623
02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:04.400
Oh, I'm fine.

1624
02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:10.830
May I have the box?

1625
02:00:21.160 --> 02:00:24.510
You know it doesn't work.
It never did.

1626
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.800
That's not important, is it?

1627
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:30.850
What's really important is that
none of this ever happened.

1628
02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:33.850
This box doesn't exist.

1629
02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.310
I never saw it before.

1630
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:38.980
Remember that.

1631
02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:50.530
Bishop?

1632
02:00:51.610 --> 02:00:54.450
All you did
was say it was broken.

1633
02:00:55.700 --> 02:01:00.040
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

1634
02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:04.130
Nope.

1635
02:01:05.210 --> 02:01:06.420
<i>In a surprise announcement,</i>

1636
02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:10.000
<i>the Republican National Committee
has revealed it is bankrupt.</i>

1637
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:14.140
<i>A spokesman for the party said they had
plenty of money in their accounts last week,</i>

1638
02:01:14.210 --> 02:01:17.470
<i>but today they just don't know
where the money has gone.</i>

1639
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:19.350
<i>But not everybody's
going begging.</i>

1640
02:01:19.430 --> 02:01:23.180
<i>Amnesty International, Greenpeace,
and the United Negro College Fund</i>

1641
02:01:23.270 --> 02:01:28.940
<i>announced record earnings this week, due
