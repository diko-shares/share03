00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.199
<i>Happy birthday, dear Janice</i>

2
00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:17.911
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

3
00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:22.999
<i>It's my anorexic boss' birthday.</i>

4
00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.710
<i>This means there's a certain amount of
inter-office pressure</i>

5
00:01:26.794 --> 00:01:28.879
<i>to stand around the conference table</i>

6
00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:32.383
<i>eating crappy food
and pretending to worship her.</i>

7
00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:35.386
That's so good.

8
00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.807
<i>Acting for five minutes like Janice
doesn't make all our lives miserable</i>

9
00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.601
<i>is the hardest work I'll do all day.</i>

10
00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.276
<i>My job title is account manager.</i>

11
00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:55.405
<i>I used to be called
an account service representative,</i>

12
00:01:55.488 --> 00:01:58.908
<i>but a consultant told us we needed
to manage our clients</i>

13
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:00.910
<i>and not service them.</i>

14
00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:09.919
<i>I have a girlfriend whom
I neither manage nor service.</i>

15
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:13.631
<i>That's my best friend, Barry,
fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table</i>

16
00:02:13.756 --> 00:02:16.342
<i>I picked up for a really good price.</i>

17
00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:21.806
<i>I'm finding it hard to care about
anything these days.</i>

18
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:27.144
<i>In fact, the only thing I do care about is
the fact that I can't care about anything.</i>

19
00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.979
<i>Seriously. It worries me.</i>

20
00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:32.983
<i>My name is Wesley Gibson.</i>

21
00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.615
<i>My dad walked out on my mom
when I was seven days old.</i>

22
00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:45.495
<i>Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked
into my baby blues eyes and asked himself,</i>

23
00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:51.334
<i>"Did I just father the most insignificant
asshole of the 21st century?"</i>

24
00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.187
Well, if you could get me the consignment
to me by the 28th... Yeah.

25
00:03:11.854 --> 00:03:14.690
Do you have the numbers in front of you?

26
00:03:25.742 --> 00:03:26.951
Relax.

27
00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:30.205
If your name had come up,
you'd be dead already.

28
00:03:32.874 --> 00:03:35.877
We've had some unexpected losses recently.

29
00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:39.380
We'd like to know

30
00:03:39.464 --> 00:03:42.383
where our competitor
is getting his munition.

31
00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:53.894
It's clean.

32
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:55.562
Meaning?

33
00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:58.065
Meaning it's untraceable.

34
00:03:58.732 --> 00:03:59.892
Your competitor's very smart.

35
00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:02.361
Get down!

36
00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.254
Fuck it.

37
00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:50.423
No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross.

38
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.968
<i>I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.</i>

39
00:05:54.052 --> 00:05:55.511
Careful.

40
00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:59.515
You don't destroy something that's been
around for a thousand years.

41
00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:02.560
<i>It's already destroyed.
He broke the code.</i>

42
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.812
<i>I have to stop this.</i>

43
00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:06.856
- Really?
<i>- You know this.</i>

44
00:06:07.982 --> 00:06:10.485
So why don't you face me yourself?

45
00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:15.698
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

46
00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:19.368
<i>They were just the decoys.</i>

47
00:06:20.035 --> 00:06:21.703
<i>Goodbye, Mr. X.</i>

48
00:06:55.444 --> 00:06:57.822
<i>Never send sheep to kill a wolf.</i>

49
00:06:57.905 --> 00:07:00.074
They were just the decoys.

50
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.743
Wesley!

51
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:04.954
What is it?

52
00:07:05.037 --> 00:07:06.914
What do you mean, "What is it"? Listen.

53
00:07:09.417 --> 00:07:13.295
Well, how am I suppose to sleep
with all that fucking racket?

54
00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:17.799
When are we gonna move so we don't
have to wake up to that shit?

55
00:07:17.882 --> 00:07:19.592
I kind of like it.

56
00:07:20.552 --> 00:07:24.556
<i>It helps to drown out the sound
of your annoying, fucking voice.</i>

57
00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.766
<i>Now, please, let me sleep.</i>

58
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.269
Have you even thought about our talk?

59
00:07:29.352 --> 00:07:30.437
Yes.

60
00:07:31.688 --> 00:07:33.189
Which one?

61
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:36.735
Perfect. That's perfect.

62
00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:39.154
Feed Annabelle.

63
00:08:24.447 --> 00:08:25.656
Sorry.

64
00:08:28.993 --> 00:08:30.995
Oh, my fucking God.

65
00:08:31.579 --> 00:08:34.874
I hope that's not my billing report
sitting on your desk.

66
00:08:34.957 --> 00:08:37.418
Holy shit on an altar, it is.

67
00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:41.214
I want that report on my desk in one hour.

68
00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:44.841
Okay, everybody,
we're all gonna stay an extra hour...

69
00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.927
<i>Want to hear something sad?</i>

70
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:51.681
<i>I need an ergonomic keyboard to
keep my repetitive stress injury in check.</i>

71
00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:56.311
<i>Just the fact that I repeat something enough
that it causes me stress is fucking sad.</i>

72
00:08:56.394 --> 00:08:58.688
Nice job, dude. You seen Barry?

73
00:09:00.023 --> 00:09:02.567
He had to go to the dentist. Again.

74
00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:05.529
Yes!

75
00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.031
Barry!

76
00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:14.537
You think they have that
morning-after pill here?

77
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.264
That thing works.
Crush it up, put it in her omelet,

78
00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:20.167
"Hey, baby, breakfast in bed."
You can never be too safe.

79
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.710
Oh, God.

80
00:09:22.753 --> 00:09:25.005
I lost my wallet somewhere.

81
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:28.884
All this together?

82
00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:31.595
- No, no.
- Yes.

83
00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:35.140
He is the man.

84
00:09:35.224 --> 00:09:37.560
- How much is it?
- Oh. Plus this.

85
00:09:38.727 --> 00:09:39.937
$20.42.

86
00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:42.480
Watermelon.

87
00:09:43.898 --> 00:09:45.441
Chicks dig it.

88
00:09:48.444 --> 00:09:49.487
Thanks.

89
00:09:49.946 --> 00:09:51.030
See you next time.

90
00:09:51.114 --> 00:09:52.198
Have a good night.

91
00:09:52.282 --> 00:09:53.825
I love these energy drinks, man.

92
00:09:53.908 --> 00:09:56.870
I'm almost, like, kind of on
an energy drink cleanse,

93
00:09:56.953 --> 00:10:00.081
where I do one for breakfast
and then, like, two or three for lunch.

94
00:10:00.164 --> 00:10:01.457
<i>I'm the man?</i>

95
00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:03.793
<i>Yeah, right, Barry, I'm the man.</i>

96
00:10:03.918 --> 00:10:05.295
<i>In fact, I'm so much the man,</i>

97
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.090
<i>I have a standing prescription for
medication to control my anxiety attacks.</i>

98
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:13.260
<i>God, I wish I had something else
to relieve my stress.</i>

99
00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:14.928
Hello, Wesley.

100
00:10:17.598 --> 00:10:20.726
<i>You know, there are people,
beautiful people,</i>

101
00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:24.563
<i>you just wish they could see you
in a different setting, a different place,</i>

102
00:10:24.646 --> 00:10:27.107
<i>instead of where you are,
what you've become.</i>

103
00:10:27.191 --> 00:10:28.942
Nicole is so hot.

104
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:31.653
What?

105
00:10:32.529 --> 00:10:34.615
Boom goes the dynamite.

106
00:10:34.698 --> 00:10:37.576
<i>But most of all,
you wish you weren't such a pussy</i>

107
00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.786
<i>for wishing for things
that will never change.</i>

108
00:10:43.456 --> 00:10:46.459
Good God A'mighty, you're over
here like it's spring fucking break,

109
00:10:46.542 --> 00:10:48.836
and I still don't have that billing report.

110
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:51.505
Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?

111
00:10:52.214 --> 00:10:53.925
I'll get it done, Janice.

112
00:10:54.008 --> 00:10:57.511
Like I never heard that before.
"I'll get it done."

113
00:10:58.721 --> 00:11:00.848
"I'll get it done. I'll
get it done, Janice.

114
00:11:00.973 --> 00:11:02.683
"I'll get it done."

115
00:11:14.027 --> 00:11:17.322
Why don't you have anything
to say for yourself?

116
00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:20.325
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:21.034 --> 00:11:22.494
Well, you're worthless.

118
00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:25.580
I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.

119
00:11:51.063 --> 00:11:54.525
<i>You know what the best thing is
about the end of the day?</i>

120
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.569
<i>Tomorrow it starts all over again.</i>

121
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.432
- Hi. How you doing?
- Good.

122
00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:27.073
- I'm sorry?
- You apologize too much.

123
00:13:30.951 --> 00:13:32.787
Sorry about that.

124
00:13:41.127 --> 00:13:42.962
I knew your father.

125
00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:49.469
My father left the week I was born, so...

126
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.724
Your father died yesterday on the rooftop
of the Metropolitan Building.

127
00:13:54.808 --> 00:13:56.142
Sorry.

128
00:14:02.482 --> 00:14:04.250
Look, the liquor rounds
are just over there, so...

129
00:14:04.274 --> 00:14:06.860
Your father was one of the greatest
assassins who ever lived.

130
00:14:06.985 --> 00:14:09.613
The man who killed him is behind you.

131
00:15:27.731 --> 00:15:29.733
This guy's just shooting up...

132
00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:39.116
Sorry. Sorry.

133
00:16:05.058 --> 00:16:08.978
What... Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
What the fuck just happened?

134
00:16:12.732 --> 00:16:14.984
Please! Please! Please drive faster.

135
00:16:15.109 --> 00:16:17.046
- Please be quiet.
- Please drive... Please drive faster.

136
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.490
Please... Please understand
that I care about my life!

137
00:16:25.662 --> 00:16:27.872
I don't know what the fuck
you did to piss this guy off,

138
00:16:27.956 --> 00:16:30.076
but you're gonna have to let me out
and call the cops!

139
00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:34.169
Hey! Hey!

140
00:16:37.965 --> 00:16:41.718
What are you doing? Oh, shit!
Are you crazy?

141
00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.974
Oh, shit!

142
00:16:52.312 --> 00:16:54.398
I think we lost him. I think we lost him.

143
00:16:54.481 --> 00:16:57.651
Could you let me out
at the next corner, please?

144
00:16:59.068 --> 00:17:00.319
Shit!

145
00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.323
Fuck!

146
00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:08.494
Oh, shit!

147
00:17:10.746 --> 00:17:12.415
He's right there!

148
00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:26.929
Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm just an accountant.

149
00:17:28.263 --> 00:17:30.015
Oh, fuck!

150
00:17:32.767 --> 00:17:35.186
He's fucking persistent, you know.

151
00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:37.814
Fuck!

152
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.115
You kick his ass!

153
00:17:51.953 --> 00:17:53.288
Shoot him!

154
00:17:54.497 --> 00:17:58.459
What are you doing?
What are you shooting our car for, huh?

155
00:18:00.169 --> 00:18:02.963
- Are you crazy?
- Grab the wheel.

156
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:05.466
Where are you going?

157
00:18:07.134 --> 00:18:08.802
Get back in here!

158
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.890
Oh, my God!

159
00:18:28.571 --> 00:18:30.656
Oh, damn! I'm sorry.

160
00:18:40.249 --> 00:18:41.709
- Gun!
- What?

161
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.005
Under the seat!

162
00:18:46.089 --> 00:18:47.256
Here.

163
00:19:13.865 --> 00:19:15.200
Oh, shit!

164
00:19:17.869 --> 00:19:19.705
Shit!

165
00:19:25.876 --> 00:19:26.877
- Look out!
- Get out!

166
00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:29.213
Look out! Oh, my God!

167
00:19:29.296 --> 00:19:30.589
Shit!

168
00:19:38.472 --> 00:19:43.436
I'm sorry!

169
00:20:02.078 --> 00:20:03.621
Behind you!

170
00:21:31.498 --> 00:21:32.749
Fuck.

171
00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:37.712
Shit. Shit.

172
00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.007
Hello.

173
00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:44.302
I don't have any money or...

174
00:21:45.512 --> 00:21:47.347
I thought he'd be

175
00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.057
taller.

176
00:21:50.224 --> 00:21:51.517
Taller?

177
00:21:52.851 --> 00:21:54.103
Sir...

178
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:59.525
Sir, I've been trying to explain
to the lady here that I'm an accountant.

179
00:21:59.608 --> 00:22:03.320
I'm an account service representative...
I'm an account manager.

180
00:22:03.404 --> 00:22:06.365
And I'm sure that if you call
my boss, Janice,

181
00:22:06.448 --> 00:22:09.326
she'd fill you in on whatever
has gone wrong.

182
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.663
You can contact her by email or...
She'll put you straight.

183
00:22:12.746 --> 00:22:14.999
Shoot the wings off the flies.

184
00:22:15.958 --> 00:22:18.210
I don't know what that means.

185
00:22:18.919 --> 00:22:22.171
Shoot the wings off the flies.

186
00:22:26.885 --> 00:22:30.430
I really think you have me mixed up
with somebody else.

187
00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:33.349
On three.

188
00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.144
Either you shoot, or I do.

189
00:22:47.488 --> 00:22:48.655
One.

190
00:22:51.783 --> 00:22:52.951
Okay.

191
00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:00.667
Two.

192
00:23:00.751 --> 00:23:02.794
I can't even see them!

193
00:23:08.342 --> 00:23:09.593
Three.

194
00:23:27.068 --> 00:23:28.653
Okay. Okay.

195
00:23:49.756 --> 00:23:50.799
That's impossible.

196
00:23:50.882 --> 00:23:54.344
A lot of things for you
weren't possible before today.

197
00:23:55.095 --> 00:23:58.348
What you experienced, Wesley,
was not a panic attack.

198
00:23:59.015 --> 00:24:02.811
Your heart was beating in excess of
400 beats per minute,

199
00:24:02.894 --> 00:24:05.605
sending abundant amounts of
adrenaline into your bloodstream.

200
00:24:05.689 --> 00:24:08.858
This allows you to see and react faster
than normal.

201
00:24:08.942 --> 00:24:11.861
Only a few people in the world can do that.

202
00:24:12.237 --> 00:24:15.281
Your father could do it and you can do it.

203
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.785
With a little work,
you can learn to control these attacks.

204
00:24:19.868 --> 00:24:21.662
Stay away from me.

205
00:24:22.413 --> 00:24:23.831
Just stay back from me.

206
00:24:23.914 --> 00:24:26.208
I have a gun, sir. All right?

207
00:24:28.168 --> 00:24:29.837
My name is Sloan.

208
00:24:30.713 --> 00:24:32.172
This is Fox.

209
00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:35.926
And the others you see around you
are all very good at killing.

210
00:24:36.009 --> 00:24:38.345
So, if I were you,
I'd keep the gun pointed at me.

211
00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:40.472
You don't wanna point it at any of them.

212
00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:42.141
That's better.

213
00:24:42.224 --> 00:24:43.642
- You're insane.
- No.

214
00:24:43.726 --> 00:24:45.810
Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing

215
00:24:45.893 --> 00:24:48.271
when you have the blood of a killer
flowing in your veins.

216
00:24:48.354 --> 00:24:51.858
Insanity is being shit on, beat down,

217
00:24:52.316 --> 00:24:54.402
coasting through life
in a miserable existence

218
00:24:54.485 --> 00:24:58.573
when you have a caged lion locked inside
and a key to release it.

219
00:24:59.741 --> 00:25:04.120
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17.
It belonged to your father.

220
00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:08.124
He could conduct
a symphony orchestra with it.

221
00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:12.211
And you're going to use it to kill the man
who shot him down in cold blood.

222
00:25:12.295 --> 00:25:16.047
- I can't...
- The same man who tried to kill you tonight.

223
00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:21.011
Your father was one of us.

224
00:25:21.094 --> 00:25:24.890
A fraternity of assassins.
The weapons of fate.

225
00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:29.394
We've transferred all of his assets
over to you.

226
00:25:29.478 --> 00:25:32.898
And let me assure
you, they are substantial.

227
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.570
It is your long-awaited destiny

228
00:25:38.653 --> 00:25:40.113
to join us.

229
00:25:52.541 --> 00:25:54.877
Back off. Back off.

230
00:25:56.629 --> 00:25:59.089
You don't know anything about me.

231
00:25:59.423 --> 00:26:02.259
Stay away from me. Stay away from me.

232
00:26:02.343 --> 00:26:04.470
You stay away from me?

233
00:26:04.553 --> 00:26:07.807
You stay away from me, please?
Will you let me through?

234
00:26:39.295 --> 00:26:42.756
<i>You know when you have a dream
and you're half awake,</i>

235
00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.883
<i>but it's still in the fringe of your brain?</i>

236
00:26:44.967 --> 00:26:48.762
<i>Then you open your eyes
and you're so damn glad it was a dream.</i>

237
00:26:56.436 --> 00:26:58.564
<i>This was nothing like that.</i>

238
00:27:25.047 --> 00:27:28.092
I'm sorry. Could you just give me
one second? Thank you.

239
00:27:37.768 --> 00:27:39.061
Oh, shit.

240
00:27:49.487 --> 00:27:50.739
Wesley.

241
00:27:54.868 --> 00:27:56.703
What's up with you?

242
00:27:57.245 --> 00:27:58.997
What do you mean?

243
00:27:59.706 --> 00:28:02.375
You're... You're here early.

244
00:28:05.378 --> 00:28:07.130
Is... You seem a little pepped up.

245
00:28:07.213 --> 00:28:09.715
- You all right?
- Well, yeah.

246
00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:11.800
Yeah.

247
00:28:12.676 --> 00:28:14.428
I guess I feel

248
00:28:15.429 --> 00:28:17.389
kind of different.

249
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:20.559
Whatever. I'm gonna go get
some Post-it Notes. Do you want one?

250
00:28:20.643 --> 00:28:21.727
- No.
- Really?

251
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.562
- Yeah.
- Okay.

252
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:41.412
Jesus H. fucking Popsicle,
I still don't have my billing reports,

253
00:28:41.496 --> 00:28:44.415
but you've got time to sit here
and Google your ass off.

254
00:28:44.499 --> 00:28:46.042
Well, I know one thing.

255
00:28:46.125 --> 00:28:48.586
You've got your review
coming up next week,

256
00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:53.007
and I can't wait to start checking me off
some big fucking boxes.

257
00:28:53.091 --> 00:28:56.094
Attitude, poor! Performance, poor!

258
00:28:57.387 --> 00:28:59.430
Management skills, poor!

259
00:28:59.514 --> 00:29:02.809
Works well with others.
That's a fucking joke.

260
00:29:04.018 --> 00:29:06.562
What is this bullshit? Who's this prick?

261
00:29:06.646 --> 00:29:09.606
Some loser gets his head blown off
at the Metropolitan...

262
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.900
Shut the fuck up!

263
00:29:19.866 --> 00:29:23.370
She has one single iota of tenuous power.

264
00:29:23.453 --> 00:29:26.289
She thinks she can push everyone around.

265
00:29:27.708 --> 00:29:29.543
You don't need this.

266
00:29:33.797 --> 00:29:35.298
I understand.

267
00:29:37.174 --> 00:29:40.136
Junior high must have been kind of tough,

268
00:29:40.219 --> 00:29:43.848
but it doesn't give you the right to treat
your workers like horseshit, Janice.

269
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:46.308
I know we laugh at you, Janice.

270
00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:50.313
We all know you keep your stash of jelly
donuts in the top drawer of your desk.

271
00:29:50.396 --> 00:29:52.481
But I want you to know

272
00:29:52.982 --> 00:29:57.111
if you weren't such a bitch,
we'd feel sorry for you.

273
00:29:59.488 --> 00:30:01.490
I do feel sorry for you.

274
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.328
But as it stands, the way you behave,

275
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:09.122
I feel I can speak for the entire office

276
00:30:09.664 --> 00:30:11.583
when I tell you

277
00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:14.419
go fuck yourself.

278
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.936
Yeah. That was great, bro. Who's the man?

279
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:40.527
I'm the man.

280
00:31:18.564 --> 00:31:20.566
That's a bad idea.

281
00:31:22.777 --> 00:31:24.404
Couldn't find your keys, huh?

282
00:31:24.487 --> 00:31:26.298
That could be handy.
You going to teach me that?

283
00:31:26.322 --> 00:31:28.032
I might need that.

284
00:31:28.991 --> 00:31:32.286
So, Fox, right? What is that?
Is that a call sign?

285
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:35.080
Is it like Maverick in <i>Top Gun?</i>

286
00:31:35.622 --> 00:31:38.208
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me?

287
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:40.085
I'm just kidding.

288
00:32:50.904 --> 00:32:52.155
Peter!

289
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:58.286
Check the shuttle rotation on this STB.
It should be 300 per minute.

290
00:32:58.578 --> 00:33:01.914
This kind of cotton weave,
the opposing thread count should be 4,000.

291
00:33:01.997 --> 00:33:05.417
Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?

292
00:33:06.835 --> 00:33:08.378
Is it a front?

293
00:33:10.339 --> 00:33:12.966
- Front for what?
- I don't know.

294
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.593
Assassinations.

295
00:33:15.802 --> 00:33:18.847
You may think this is
a front for something,

296
00:33:19.681 --> 00:33:22.684
all I can tell you is
this is a textile mill.

297
00:33:22.768 --> 00:33:25.687
And George...
George, go help Peter up there.

298
00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:26.897
Yeah.

299
00:33:28.357 --> 00:33:30.234
This is a textile mill.

300
00:33:30.691 --> 00:33:31.817
And a damn good one.

301
00:33:31.901 --> 00:33:34.695
Yeah, that's cute,
but that's bullshit, right?

302
00:33:34.779 --> 00:33:38.032
I mean, all these guys are killers,
aren't they?

303
00:33:40.368 --> 00:33:42.495
I think you owe me some answers.

304
00:33:42.995 --> 00:33:45.665
All right. Clearly I don't understand,

305
00:33:45.748 --> 00:33:48.584
but do you make sweaters
or do you kill people?

306
00:34:09.145 --> 00:34:12.232
That's an awful lot of
questions over coffee.

307
00:34:21.241 --> 00:34:23.451
Are you sure you're ready for the answers?

308
00:34:23.535 --> 00:34:25.203
Yes, I'm sure.

309
00:34:26.121 --> 00:34:27.956
I can't go back.

310
00:34:28.039 --> 00:34:29.707
Not to my life.

311
00:34:34.253 --> 00:34:35.838
He's all yours.

312
00:34:36.755 --> 00:34:38.590
All right. We're up.

313
00:34:49.393 --> 00:34:50.978
How you doing?

314
00:34:52.104 --> 00:34:53.689
I'm The Repairman.

315
00:34:53.772 --> 00:34:55.524
What do you repair?

316
00:34:55.899 --> 00:34:59.944
A lifetime of bad habits.

317
00:35:00.153 --> 00:35:02.447
- Okay.
- Would you do me a favor?

318
00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.116
Just put your arms behind your back.

319
00:35:05.199 --> 00:35:07.618
- It's okay.
- I don't know...

320
00:35:07.702 --> 00:35:09.370
- Just behind your back.
- Is this okay?

321
00:35:09.454 --> 00:35:10.788
Just relax.

322
00:35:10.872 --> 00:35:12.624
Is this part of it?

323
00:35:13.791 --> 00:35:15.251
There we go.

324
00:35:15.626 --> 00:35:20.006
- You going to put a bag over my head?
- No. There's no need for a bag.

325
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:23.301
- That's not too tight, is it?
- No, that's nice.

326
00:35:32.434 --> 00:35:34.102
Why did you come here, Wesley?

327
00:35:34.186 --> 00:35:36.980
Well, you brought me here, remember?

328
00:35:37.064 --> 00:35:39.358
What the fuck did you do that...

329
00:35:55.248 --> 00:35:56.916
How many punches
did The Repairman throw

330
00:35:56.999 --> 00:35:59.335
before he was counting sheep?

331
00:36:00.836 --> 00:36:05.007
Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having
my face smashed in before, all right?

332
00:36:05.091 --> 00:36:09.637
- Did you spend a lot of time with knives?
- At breakfast, lunch and dinner.

333
00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:12.181
Fuck.

334
00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.479
It was a rhetorical question, <i>culo.</i>

335
00:36:18.562 --> 00:36:21.857
You interrupt me again,
I use the business end.

336
00:36:22.775 --> 00:36:24.735
Here's what you need to know, <i>puto.</i>

337
00:36:24.819 --> 00:36:27.028
Knives are easy to hide.

338
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.699
They don't jam and they never
run out of bullets.

339
00:36:33.201 --> 00:36:35.370
They come in handy

340
00:36:35.453 --> 00:36:38.081
when you have to do some
close contact work.

341
00:36:38.164 --> 00:36:39.958
What the fuck, man?

342
00:36:47.715 --> 00:36:49.926
- Come here. Come here.
- What?

343
00:36:51.553 --> 00:36:53.721
- Now, try to cut me.
- What?

344
00:36:55.389 --> 00:36:57.349
Try to cut me. Hey!

345
00:36:57.808 --> 00:37:01.812
- Just stick me with that...
- Be careful with that. That's sharp.

346
00:37:01.895 --> 00:37:04.898
- Just stick and stick and stick.
- Why?

347
00:37:04.982 --> 00:37:07.568
- Seriously, man, I could hurt you.
- Hey!

348
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:09.570
Okay, pussy.

349
00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:11.488
- I'm not a pussy.
- You're a pussy.

350
00:37:11.572 --> 00:37:13.198
- No, I'm not a pussy.
- You're a pussy!

351
00:37:13.282 --> 00:37:16.285
I'm not a pussy. I got a healthy respect
for the human condition.

352
00:37:16.368 --> 00:37:18.078
- Fuck that, you pussy!
- I'm not a pussy!

353
00:37:18.162 --> 00:37:19.389
- You're a pussy!
- I'm not a pussy!

354
00:37:19.413 --> 00:37:21.874
- Come on, pussy.
- I'm not a pussy!

355
00:37:44.103 --> 00:37:45.938
Hi. How you doing?

356
00:37:46.022 --> 00:37:48.191
What the fuck?

357
00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:49.901
The fuck!

358
00:37:50.026 --> 00:37:52.278
Just a moment. Just a moment.

359
00:37:53.779 --> 00:37:54.946
Sorry.

360
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:56.907
Hello? Hey!

361
00:37:57.032 --> 00:37:59.075
Hey, come back! Hey!

362
00:37:59.701 --> 00:38:01.870
You must drink. Drink. Yeah.

363
00:38:09.044 --> 00:38:11.963
- What is this?
- This is the recovery room.

364
00:38:12.547 --> 00:38:17.093
This bath stimulates white blood cells
and speed up the process.

365
00:38:17.219 --> 00:38:20.722
In here, bruises, cuts, breaks
heal in hours, not days.

366
00:38:21.056 --> 00:38:22.806
You shitting me?

367
00:38:24.892 --> 00:38:26.602
- What is that? Vodka?
- Yeah.

368
00:38:26.727 --> 00:38:28.604
- Are you Russian?
- Yeah.

369
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.981
Get up.

370
00:38:32.816 --> 00:38:34.235
This is The Gunsmith.

371
00:38:34.318 --> 00:38:39.323
He knows more about a piece than anybody,
and he's gonna teach you how to use one.

372
00:38:39.406 --> 00:38:41.742
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.

373
00:38:43.077 --> 00:38:46.705
- You know that Seltzer broke his leg?
- Oh, really?

374
00:38:46.789 --> 00:38:48.749
Yeah, in three places.

375
00:38:49.917 --> 00:38:52.669
- How'd he do that?
- Jumped off a building.

376
00:38:53.586 --> 00:38:57.048
- So, is he okay?
- Yeah. It's pretty bad, though.

377
00:38:57.131 --> 00:38:58.758
Oh, my God.

378
00:38:59.425 --> 00:39:02.428
Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic.

379
00:39:04.097 --> 00:39:06.474
He's been in recovery for, like,
three days now,

380
00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:09.686
and they say they're not even
gonna let him out.

381
00:39:19.195 --> 00:39:20.862
Oh, my God.

382
00:39:22.197 --> 00:39:23.615
Oh, my God.

383
00:39:24.116 --> 00:39:25.367
Oh, my God!

384
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.870
Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman!
She might be somebody's mom...

385
00:39:30.998 --> 00:39:34.710
You need to know what it's like
to put a bullet in a body.

386
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.962
Why are you here?

387
00:39:37.671 --> 00:39:42.009
You know, I thought I was learning to be
some kind of super assassin.

388
00:39:43.468 --> 00:39:44.696
You know, if I wanted to get beat up,

389
00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.723
I would have stayed in my cubicle,
you know.

390
00:39:55.021 --> 00:39:56.188
Fuck.

391
00:40:07.366 --> 00:40:09.535
All right, shoot the target.

392
00:40:10.244 --> 00:40:11.829
From there.

393
00:40:12.997 --> 00:40:17.209
- You want me shoot through Wilbur?
- I want you to curve the bullet.

394
00:40:18.085 --> 00:40:20.420
How am I suppose to do that?

395
00:40:20.503 --> 00:40:22.714
It's not a question of how,

396
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:25.133
it's a question of what.

397
00:40:25.216 --> 00:40:28.386
If no one told you
that bullets flew straight

398
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:30.680
and I gave you a gun
and told you to hit the target,

399
00:40:30.764 --> 00:40:32.515
what would you do?

400
00:40:33.558 --> 00:40:35.894
Let your instincts guide you.

401
00:40:50.074 --> 00:40:52.284
How the hell did he do that?

402
00:40:52.368 --> 00:40:55.204
Can you do that? Can you do that? Hello?

403
00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:01.293
Hey, I think that's my old train.

404
00:41:01.377 --> 00:41:02.753
Still is.

405
00:41:11.887 --> 00:41:14.640
Shit! You fucking asshole!

406
00:41:14.723 --> 00:41:16.100
Come on!

407
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:21.854
Let's go.

408
00:41:21.938 --> 00:41:24.399
Are you out of your fucking mind?

409
00:41:35.284 --> 00:41:38.913
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

410
00:41:57.764 --> 00:42:01.601
Oh, God, I feel... I feel... I feel...

411
00:42:02.018 --> 00:42:03.854
I feel kind of good.

412
00:42:11.778 --> 00:42:15.990
He got Rictus.
Perfect shot. Impossible angle.

413
00:42:17.033 --> 00:42:19.618
Cross is taking us out one by one.

414
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.793
And Wesley is the only one
who can get to him.

415
00:42:29.503 --> 00:42:31.964
Cross gets closer with each hour.

416
00:42:34.467 --> 00:42:36.135
Get back to work.

417
00:42:39.513 --> 00:42:40.806
See that?

418
00:42:41.307 --> 00:42:43.184
- It's a shuttle.
- Okay.

419
00:42:44.351 --> 00:42:46.811
I want you to try and catch it.

420
00:42:47.812 --> 00:42:49.481
You want me to stick my hand in there?

421
00:42:49.564 --> 00:42:51.691
Yes. I want you to catch it.

422
00:43:01.534 --> 00:43:02.869
You wanna put a gun to my head?

423
00:43:02.994 --> 00:43:04.874
I can just slow things down
like with the flies.

424
00:43:04.913 --> 00:43:07.999
You need to learn
to control that by yourself.

425
00:43:22.763 --> 00:43:24.431
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

426
00:43:25.015 --> 00:43:27.226
This is bullshit! Fuck this!

427
00:43:37.736 --> 00:43:39.696
How's it going today, Wesley?

428
00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.783
No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!

429
00:43:42.866 --> 00:43:46.702
I can shoot the wings off
the back of a fly! I'm ready!

430
00:43:46.786 --> 00:43:49.080
You're ready when Fox says you're ready.

431
00:43:49.205 --> 00:43:51.624
- Who put her in charge?
- I did.

432
00:43:56.629 --> 00:43:57.922
Wesley.

433
00:44:02.718 --> 00:44:05.638
People think you use cheese
to catch these beauties.

434
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:08.432
But they go apeshit for peanut butter.

435
00:44:09.225 --> 00:44:13.144
Your father was a big fan of this. Watch.

436
00:44:16.731 --> 00:44:19.401
Plastic explosive and peanut butter!

437
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:21.736
Sorry, Mickey.

438
00:44:23.488 --> 00:44:26.491
Five, four, three, two, one.

439
00:44:34.583 --> 00:44:36.501
Hey. Hey, Russian.

440
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.630
Good for one. Yeah.

441
00:44:41.338 --> 00:44:43.841
Imagine if you had a thousand.

442
00:44:45.801 --> 00:44:48.637
They really fucked you up, didn't they?

443
00:44:49.305 --> 00:44:51.473
What the hell did they do to you?

444
00:44:52.766 --> 00:44:54.977
Throw you in front of a moving train
for no reason?

445
00:44:55.102 --> 00:44:57.146
Beat the shit out of you?

446
00:44:58.105 --> 00:45:03.319
You know, you can say it,
this place is bullshit. It's bullshit, huh?

447
00:45:03.444 --> 00:45:04.737
Bullshit!

448
00:45:13.661 --> 00:45:15.705
Five minutes.

449
00:45:18.291 --> 00:45:20.627
Heads up out of the question?

450
00:45:26.382 --> 00:45:27.634
Fuck.

451
00:45:27.717 --> 00:45:30.136
You're a waste of my fucking time!
Why are you here?

452
00:45:30.219 --> 00:45:32.222
I don't know, so hit me.

453
00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:45.192
- Why are you here?
- I had a shit life, so why wouldn't I?

454
00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:49.321
I wanna kick your fucking ass!

455
00:45:50.322 --> 00:45:52.115
Tell me what you want me to say.

456
00:45:52.199 --> 00:45:54.701
- Why are you here?
- I don't know!

457
00:45:57.704 --> 00:45:59.414
Why are you here?

458
00:46:00.749 --> 00:46:03.126
- Why are you here?
- I don't know why I'm here.

459
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.920
Why are you here?

460
00:46:08.006 --> 00:46:09.173
Why are you here?

461
00:46:09.257 --> 00:46:12.343
I don't know who I am.

462
00:46:17.264 --> 00:46:19.558
- What did you say?
- I said...

463
00:46:20.559 --> 00:46:22.770
I said I don't know who I am.

464
00:46:37.243 --> 00:46:40.078
Do you really want to know who you are?

465
00:46:52.298 --> 00:46:54.217
Yeah. It's my room.

466
00:46:54.884 --> 00:46:56.052
No.

467
00:46:57.762 --> 00:46:59.931
This was your father's room.

468
00:47:13.068 --> 00:47:14.653
What happened?

469
00:47:15.571 --> 00:47:18.282
A member of this fraternity went rogue.

470
00:47:18.741 --> 00:47:19.950
Cross.

471
00:47:22.619 --> 00:47:26.332
He started by killing
the one man who was better than him.

472
00:47:27.583 --> 00:47:29.084
Your father.

473
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.839
Blindsided him on a rooftop.

474
00:47:34.673 --> 00:47:36.175
Betrayed him.

475
00:47:39.302 --> 00:47:41.471
Everything in this room,

476
00:47:41.596 --> 00:47:45.141
books, weapons, clothes,

477
00:47:45.767 --> 00:47:47.477
belonged to him.

478
00:47:47.602 --> 00:47:49.604
Now they belong to you.

479
00:47:50.772 --> 00:47:53.483
Find a connection in this room, Wesley.

480
00:47:54.817 --> 00:47:58.029
It may be the only way
of finding out who you are.

481
00:48:17.798 --> 00:48:21.718
<i>Now I know why I could never care
about anything before this.</i>

482
00:48:22.677 --> 00:48:24.471
<i>I was living a lie.</i>

483
00:48:26.056 --> 00:48:29.643
<i>Finally, I have a chance to step
into my father's shoes.</i>

484
00:48:29.726 --> 00:48:33.230
<i>Grow a pair. Live the
life I was born to live.</i>

485
00:48:34.022 --> 00:48:38.234
<i>I've been pissing it all away
like it was another fucking billing report.</i>

486
00:48:38.317 --> 00:48:39.985
<i>I have to train harder.</i>

487
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:42.655
<i>I have to be as good as my father.</i>

488
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:55.292
On these shelves, Wesley,
are the records of the Fraternity kills,

489
00:48:55.376 --> 00:48:58.587
everything you will
need to kill your target.

490
00:48:58.671 --> 00:49:01.215
<i>To kill Cross,</i>

491
00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:06.094
<i>the man who betrayed the Fraternity
and murdered my father, I must prepare.</i>

492
00:49:06.177 --> 00:49:10.515
<i>I have to become his student,
memorize every move he ever made,</i>

493
00:49:10.598 --> 00:49:13.017
<i>every attack he ever executed.</i>

494
00:49:20.525 --> 00:49:25.196
<i>When he dropped a patient in an airtight
room surrounded by Secret Service agents.</i>

495
00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.074
<i>When he took out that
businessman in the elevator.</i>

496
00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:30.285
<i>His bullets untraceable, of course.</i>

497
00:49:32.745 --> 00:49:37.374
<i>Or how no matter what the weapon
or how he eliminated his target,</i>

498
00:49:38.917 --> 00:49:41.628
<i>he was always one chess move ahead.</i>

499
00:49:43.046 --> 00:49:44.923
<i>One move more prepared.</i>

500
00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:47.092
<i>One step quicker.</i>

501
00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:49.136
<i>One shot more precise.</i>

502
00:49:49.761 --> 00:49:54.266
<i>In fact, in all my research,
I found that he never missed a target.</i>

503
00:49:55.184 --> 00:49:56.727
<i>Not until me.</i>

504
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:05.417
Yeah!

505
00:51:53.172 --> 00:51:57.468
First time in your life, Wesley,
you're in control.

506
00:52:35.755 --> 00:52:37.423
Shoot the target.

507
00:52:49.352 --> 00:52:50.853
You're crazy.

508
00:53:39.775 --> 00:53:41.944
Welcome to the Fraternity.

509
00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:56.582
We call this the Loom of Fate.

510
00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:13.224
After today,
you will never set foot in here again.

511
00:54:13.307 --> 00:54:14.642
Why not?

512
00:54:15.101 --> 00:54:17.145
Because, like an apostle,

513
00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:21.858
your task is not to
interpret, but to deliver.

514
00:54:24.485 --> 00:54:27.529
Every culture in history has a secret code,

515
00:54:27.863 --> 00:54:30.699
one you won't find in traditional texts.

516
00:54:31.992 --> 00:54:34.077
<i>A thousand years ago,</i>

517
00:54:34.161 --> 00:54:38.498
<i>a clan of weavers discovered
a mystical language hidden in the fabric.</i>

518
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.378
They called themselves the Fraternity.

519
00:54:43.503 --> 00:54:46.131
I'll be honest with you,
all I see are threads.

520
00:54:47.215 --> 00:54:48.633
Come here.

521
00:54:52.679 --> 00:54:54.138
Look there.

522
00:54:55.347 --> 00:54:57.308
Do you see that one thread
that missed the weave

523
00:54:57.391 --> 00:54:58.934
and lies on top of the others?

524
00:54:59.018 --> 00:55:02.062
- Like a mistake?
- No, it's a code.

525
00:55:03.022 --> 00:55:06.358
If the vertical thread
is on top, it's a one.

526
00:55:07.485 --> 00:55:09.820
If it's below, it's a zero.

527
00:55:10.863 --> 00:55:12.406
Binary code?

528
00:55:13.032 --> 00:55:14.408
What does it say?

529
00:55:15.201 --> 00:55:16.702
It's a name.

530
00:55:17.578 --> 00:55:19.038
A target.

531
00:55:21.248 --> 00:55:23.500
Where do the names come from?

532
00:55:24.334 --> 00:55:27.086
Come out of a necessity, Wesley.

533
00:55:27.212 --> 00:55:30.215
A necessity to maintain balance
in the world.

534
00:55:30.757 --> 00:55:33.510
They are orders that must be executed,

535
00:55:33.885 --> 00:55:39.390
entrusted to us so that we
might forge stability out of chaos.

536
00:55:41.893 --> 00:55:43.895
This one is yours.

537
00:55:48.066 --> 00:55:49.442
I don't...

538
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:54.029
Look, I thought you brought me here
to kill Cross.

539
00:55:54.112 --> 00:55:55.405
You will.

540
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:56.907
In time.

541
00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:00.619
This is your first assignment.

542
00:56:00.744 --> 00:56:02.871
The loom provides,

543
00:56:02.955 --> 00:56:04.873
I interpret,

544
00:56:04.957 --> 00:56:06.208
you deliver.

545
00:56:07.459 --> 00:56:09.795
You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?

546
00:56:12.422 --> 00:56:13.757
Not me.

547
00:56:15.259 --> 00:56:16.426
Fate.

548
00:56:23.808 --> 00:56:27.645
The target will be in the conference
room, sitting at the head chair.

549
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.647
There are six windows.

550
00:56:30.147 --> 00:56:32.650
You will shoot through the fifth.

551
00:56:42.451 --> 00:56:43.995
Fifth window.

552
00:56:51.501 --> 00:56:52.669
Now.

553
00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:19.154
<i>What did he do
that he deserves to die?</i>

554
00:57:20.154 --> 00:57:21.780
<i>You don't know.</i>

555
00:57:22.823 --> 00:57:26.452
I don't know if he was bad,
I don't know if he was evil.

556
00:57:26.994 --> 00:57:29.371
I don't know anything about him.

557
00:57:30.539 --> 00:57:32.875
We get our orders from a loom.

558
00:57:33.792 --> 00:57:34.877
Fate.

559
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:39.548
And we're supposed to take it on faith
that what we're doing is right.

560
00:57:41.133 --> 00:57:43.844
Killing someone we know nothing about,

561
00:57:46.013 --> 00:57:48.223
I don't know if I can do that.

562
00:58:00.652 --> 00:58:02.362
About 20 years ago,

563
00:58:03.863 --> 00:58:05.823
there was this girl.

564
00:58:06.908 --> 00:58:09.869
Her dad was a federal judge,

565
00:58:09.994 --> 00:58:14.707
so she probably had it in her mind
that she was gonna follow in his footsteps.

566
00:58:20.087 --> 00:58:22.339
<i>So she's home one Christmas,</i>

567
00:58:22.422 --> 00:58:25.425
<i>and her dad's on this
big racketeering case.</i>

568
00:58:25.717 --> 00:58:28.762
<i>The defendants want to get a softer judge.</i>

569
00:58:29.221 --> 00:58:31.223
<i>One they can buy off.</i>

570
00:58:32.265 --> 00:58:34.351
<i>So they hire this guy,</i>

571
00:58:35.769 --> 00:58:37.396
<i>Max Petridge,</i>

572
00:58:38.897 --> 00:58:41.441
get him to pay her father a visit.

573
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:47.239
And the way he pays people a visit

574
00:58:49.115 --> 00:58:50.157
<i>is to break in</i>

575
00:58:52.076 --> 00:58:54.495
<i>and tie up their loved ones,</i>

576
00:58:54.578 --> 00:58:56.914
<i>and force them to watch</i>

577
00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.584
<i>while he burns his targets alive.</i>

578
00:59:09.927 --> 00:59:13.264
And then he takes a wire hanger
and twists it round

579
00:59:14.432 --> 00:59:19.102
and brands his initials into each
one of them so they will never ever forget.

580
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.818
After I was recruited into the Fraternity,

581
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.280
I found out that Max Petridge's name
had come up

582
00:59:30.613 --> 00:59:33.616
weeks before the federal judge was killed,

583
00:59:34.284 --> 00:59:38.455
and that a Fraternity member
had failed to pull the trigger.

584
00:59:42.459 --> 00:59:45.961
We don't know how far
the ripples of our decisions go.

585
00:59:48.297 --> 00:59:50.507
You kill one, and maybe,

586
00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.968
save a thousand.

587
00:59:54.136 --> 00:59:56.847
That's the code of the Fraternity.

588
00:59:56.972 --> 01:00:00.517
That's what we believe in,
and that's why we do it.

589
01:00:21.662 --> 01:00:22.830
Now!

590
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:08.834
Cross.

591
01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.210
Not yet.

592
01:01:12.963 --> 01:01:15.214
<i>Your target will be in a black limo.</i>

593
01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:18.008
<i>He always travels the same
six blocks of Halsted.</i>

594
01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:20.136
<i>You have three blocks to kill him.</i>

595
01:01:28.644 --> 01:01:29.895
Shit.

596
01:02:13.103 --> 01:02:15.105
I'm sorry.

597
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.626
Barry! Could you feed Annabelle?

598
01:02:36.543 --> 01:02:37.878
Barry!

599
01:02:41.297 --> 01:02:46.302
Wesley. Hey, where have you been?
I have really missed you, man.

600
01:02:49.138 --> 01:02:52.516
Look at the big man.
You fucking asshole! What?

601
01:02:52.642 --> 01:02:53.869
What? You don't show up for weeks,

602
01:02:53.893 --> 01:02:56.520
now you're just gonna stop by
and use the bathroom?

603
01:02:56.646 --> 01:02:59.106
You think you're a real big shot now, huh?

604
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:01.567
No. You know what? You are nothing!

605
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:04.028
No, you are less than nothing.

606
01:03:04.487 --> 01:03:07.406
You're not even half the man that Barry is.

607
01:03:07.865 --> 01:03:11.993
Barry, he pleases me in ways
that you've never even heard of!

608
01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:19.167
Who the hell is she, Wesley?
Your new whore?

609
01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:22.504
Is that what it takes now?
You're paying for it?

610
01:03:55.035 --> 01:03:56.370
Wesley?

611
01:03:57.871 --> 01:03:59.373
He's the man.

612
01:04:08.382 --> 01:04:10.383
- You all right?
- Yeah.

613
01:04:10.466 --> 01:04:13.970
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Go sit down. I'm gonna find a car.

614
01:04:14.053 --> 01:04:16.889
Big night. I got to get into recovery.

615
01:04:33.239 --> 01:04:34.449
Shit.

616
01:04:40.245 --> 01:04:41.413
Fuck!

617
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:23.429
Bull's-eye.

618
01:06:25.556 --> 01:06:27.266
What's he doing here?

619
01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:48.452
- Come on!
- Come on. Just stay with us.

620
01:06:48.536 --> 01:06:49.954
Pull back his jacket.

621
01:06:54.584 --> 01:06:57.420
Breathe. Breathe, all right?

622
01:07:00.423 --> 01:07:04.176
It's all right. It's all
right. It's all right.

623
01:07:04.259 --> 01:07:05.427
A thousand.

624
01:07:05.552 --> 01:07:06.887
Come on!

625
01:07:08.638 --> 01:07:10.682
- Come on!
- No! No! Stay with us.

626
01:07:10.765 --> 01:07:11.892
- Come on.
- Open your eyes!

627
01:07:11.975 --> 01:07:13.310
Come on!

628
01:07:14.394 --> 01:07:15.437
Come on!

629
01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:18.106
Come on!

630
01:08:08.446 --> 01:08:11.991
This bullet is the first traceable bullet
he's ever used.

631
01:08:13.493 --> 01:08:16.704
It was made by this man.
His name is Pekwarsky.

632
01:08:16.788 --> 01:08:20.291
He works out of what is now
a monastery in Eastern Moravia.

633
01:08:20.375 --> 01:08:23.294
This place is where
the Fraternity was born.

634
01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:30.301
He's taunting me.

635
01:08:30.385 --> 01:08:32.427
He's sending me a message.

636
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:34.012
I'm gonna send him one back.

637
01:08:34.096 --> 01:08:36.014
He's trapping you.

638
01:08:36.098 --> 01:08:38.475
Leading you to a place he knows very well.

639
01:08:38.559 --> 01:08:40.435
Look, I know this. I...

640
01:08:42.562 --> 01:08:45.148
This is what you trained me for.

641
01:08:45.232 --> 01:08:46.608
You can't go alone.

642
01:08:46.692 --> 01:08:49.820
I go alone or he doesn't show.
He's not stupid.

643
01:08:50.195 --> 01:08:54.866
Look, a member of the Fraternity
is dead because of me.

644
01:09:00.371 --> 01:09:01.497
Okay.

645
01:09:03.833 --> 01:09:04.959
Go.

646
01:09:08.838 --> 01:09:10.256
Thank you.

647
01:09:18.097 --> 01:09:20.683
I don't think that's a good idea.

648
01:09:30.442 --> 01:09:32.277
Your next assignment.

649
01:10:31.876 --> 01:10:33.211
Pekwarsky?

650
01:10:48.393 --> 01:10:49.519
Shit.

651
01:10:57.484 --> 01:10:59.486
What are you doing here?

652
01:11:00.737 --> 01:11:02.406
Lower your gun.

653
01:11:12.874 --> 01:11:14.751
You recognize this?

654
01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.780
I pulled this out of my shoulder.

655
01:11:16.837 --> 01:11:19.423
The guy who put it there killed my father.

656
01:11:19.506 --> 01:11:21.717
Now, I know you made it,
so tell me where he is.

657
01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:25.762
I did mold this, but I can't be responsible
for the people who use them.

658
01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:28.848
I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is.

659
01:11:28.931 --> 01:11:30.599
Look at my finger.

660
01:11:32.309 --> 01:11:35.312
I can try and arrange a meet.

661
01:11:58.543 --> 01:12:01.629
Have you ever thought about
doing things differently?

662
01:12:01.713 --> 01:12:03.339
How do you mean?

663
01:12:03.423 --> 01:12:04.966
I don't know.

664
01:12:05.967 --> 01:12:08.136
Being somebody else.

665
01:12:09.137 --> 01:12:11.139
Somebody normal.

666
01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:19.355
No.

667
01:12:25.319 --> 01:12:26.487
Shit.

668
01:12:28.322 --> 01:12:29.907
Out of the way!

669
01:13:00.228 --> 01:13:01.437
Stay.

670
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:23.375
Hey!

671
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:27.462
He's on the train.

672
01:13:27.879 --> 01:13:29.297
<i>He's alone.</i>

673
01:13:29.714 --> 01:13:31.132
Thank you.

674
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.115
Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!

675
01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:58.701
Sir, sit down! Nobody's gonna get hurt.

676
01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:01.871
Sir, sit... Sit down! Sir, sit down!

677
01:14:13.924 --> 01:14:16.802
Get out of the way! Sit down!
Stay down! Stay down!

678
01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:18.721
Stay down! It's okay! Sit down!

679
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:30.523
Wesley.

680
01:14:39.198 --> 01:14:41.492
Out of the way! Out of the way!

681
01:15:52.894 --> 01:15:54.562
No, no, no!

682
01:18:30.338 --> 01:18:33.049
Wesley, listen to me.

683
01:18:33.133 --> 01:18:35.093
Shut the fuck up!

684
01:18:35.176 --> 01:18:37.345
You don't get to talk to me.

685
01:18:37.428 --> 01:18:38.972
You don't get to talk to me.

686
01:18:39.055 --> 01:18:41.850
Everything they told you was a lie.

687
01:18:42.725 --> 01:18:46.061
Shut up, you lying piece of shit.
You shut the fuck up.

688
01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.647
You are my son.

689
01:18:53.694 --> 01:18:55.362
What did you say?

690
01:18:55.946 --> 01:18:57.990
What did you say to me?

691
01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.272
Is it true?

692
01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:35.109
Yes.

693
01:19:39.447 --> 01:19:40.948
Why did you make me do this?

694
01:19:41.032 --> 01:19:44.242
Because you are the only person
he wouldn't kill.

695
01:19:49.205 --> 01:19:50.999
You knew, God damn it.

696
01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.376
You knew the entire time.

697
01:19:54.502 --> 01:19:56.421
Well, his name came up.

698
01:19:58.423 --> 01:20:00.050
So did yours.

699
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:48.429
No, it was okay. Never mind.

700
01:20:49.847 --> 01:20:52.475
No. No, it was complete shit.

701
01:21:13.161 --> 01:21:15.414
I promised your father
I'd bring you back here.

702
01:21:15.497 --> 01:21:17.040
What the fuck?

703
01:21:18.208 --> 01:21:21.253
He said it was the only way you'd believe.

704
01:21:28.552 --> 01:21:31.930
Your father was never more than
a camera click away.

705
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:50.364
That's me.

706
01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:56.328
He was my father.

707
01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:00.332
And I killed him.

708
01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:04.670
To your father, protecting you
was worth giving up his life.

709
01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:07.340
Protect me?

710
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:10.508
He was trying to fucking kill me!

711
01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:14.262
No. He wasn't trying to kill you.

712
01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:17.182
He was trying to rescue you.

713
01:22:23.146 --> 01:22:25.648
<i>When Cross left the Fraternity,</i>

714
01:22:25.732 --> 01:22:27.692
<i>Sloan hunted you down.</i>

715
01:22:29.527 --> 01:22:34.407
<i>Ever since Fox had her teeth in you,
he's been trying to separate you from them.</i>

716
01:22:37.201 --> 01:22:40.704
<i>Your father never wanted you
in the Fraternity, Wesley.</i>

717
01:22:41.872 --> 01:22:44.541
<i>He wanted a different path for you,</i>

718
01:22:49.838 --> 01:22:52.549
with things that he could never have.

719
01:22:53.258 --> 01:22:54.593
A home.

720
01:22:55.552 --> 01:22:57.221
- Peace.
- No.

721
01:22:57.846 --> 01:23:00.808
He hoped you would find your own way.

722
01:23:07.396 --> 01:23:09.732
Your father got hold of this.

723
01:23:11.692 --> 01:23:13.694
Decipher it yourself.

724
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:25.415
Sloan began manufacturing targets
of his own for profit years ago.

725
01:23:27.417 --> 01:23:29.752
Your father found out about it.

726
01:23:30.253 --> 01:23:32.613
And he was going to do something about it
on his own, right?

727
01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:35.507
But Sloan turned everyone against him.

728
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:38.051
My father's name
never even came up, did it?

729
01:23:38.176 --> 01:23:41.179
No. Holding to the code made him a target.

730
01:23:45.809 --> 01:23:46.935
Yes.

731
01:24:01.366 --> 01:24:03.743
- You want me to run?
- No.

732
01:24:04.411 --> 01:24:06.203
I want you to live.

733
01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.332
You can have a different life, Wesley.

734
01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.794
Like your father wanted for you.

735
01:25:40.586 --> 01:25:42.421
We trained him well.

736
01:26:26.298 --> 01:26:28.592
<i>My father was wrong
about one thing.</i>

737
01:26:28.675 --> 01:26:31.385
<i>Everything they told me wasn't a lie.</i>

738
01:26:31.468 --> 01:26:34.763
<i>They taught me how to kill,
how to feel no pain,</i>

739
01:26:34.847 --> 01:26:38.809
<i>and most importantly,
that every job has a perfect weapon.</i>

740
01:26:42.354 --> 01:26:44.940
<i>Well, I'm the perfect weapon.</i>

741
01:26:46.984 --> 01:26:49.069
<i>And I'm supposed to run?</i>

742
01:26:49.153 --> 01:26:51.739
<i>No, I've been doing that my entire life.</i>

743
01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:53.657
<i>So I say no.</i>

744
01:26:54.616 --> 01:26:58.203
<i>I say kill them all
and let fate sort out the mess.</i>

745
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:54.383
Kill him.

746
01:28:47.475 --> 01:28:48.852
He's here!

747
01:31:58.910 --> 01:32:00.202
Pussy.

748
01:32:01.537 --> 01:32:03.289
Pussy, pussy.

749
01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:19.180
Pussy, pussy.

750
01:32:24.225 --> 01:32:25.518
Pussy.

751
01:33:30.915 --> 01:33:33.209
Sloan!

752
01:33:51.143 --> 01:33:53.478
My father wasn't a traitor.

753
01:33:56.898 --> 01:33:58.734
This is a kill order.

754
01:34:01.403 --> 01:34:03.739
And it's got Sloan's name on it.

755
01:34:07.159 --> 01:34:09.161
What did you say to me?

756
01:34:09.828 --> 01:34:12.080
It's a name. It's a target.

757
01:34:15.167 --> 01:34:17.501
I don't want this person dead.

758
01:34:18.377 --> 01:34:19.879
Fate does.

759
01:34:23.382 --> 01:34:25.509
Fate wanted you dead.

760
01:34:27.553 --> 01:34:29.221
And he couldn't take it.

761
01:34:29.305 --> 01:34:33.350
So he started manufacturing
his own targets for his own gains.

762
01:34:34.018 --> 01:34:38.189
And that's when my dad found out
and decided to stand against him.

763
01:34:39.231 --> 01:34:42.985
And that's when you sent a man's son

764
01:34:43.069 --> 01:34:44.987
to kill his father.

765
01:34:48.031 --> 01:34:50.867
You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan.

766
01:34:52.702 --> 01:34:55.455
You're just a thug who can bend bullets.

767
01:35:12.013 --> 01:35:13.556
Is that true?

768
01:35:20.521 --> 01:35:22.648
Here is what the truth is.

769
01:35:26.693 --> 01:35:28.278
Your name came up.

770
01:35:39.498 --> 01:35:41.208
Your name came up.

771
01:35:56.472 --> 01:35:58.224
Your name came up.

772
01:36:00.226 --> 01:36:01.561
Your name.

773
01:36:03.145 --> 01:36:04.564
Your name.

774
01:36:05.231 --> 01:36:06.566
Yours.

775
01:36:07.733 --> 01:36:10.027
Everyone in this room.

776
01:36:15.574 --> 01:36:18.076
If I had not done what I did,

777
01:36:20.412 --> 01:36:22.414
you would all be dead.

778
01:36:25.041 --> 01:36:27.043
I saved your lives.

779
01:36:28.712 --> 01:36:32.674
Now look where we are.
We are stronger than ever.

780
01:36:33.884 --> 01:36:36.887
Changing the course
of history as we see it.

781
01:36:38.889 --> 01:36:41.266
Choosing the targets we select.

782
01:36:43.267 --> 01:36:47.187
We can redistribute power where we see fit.

783
01:36:49.732 --> 01:36:51.317
The wolves rule.

784
01:36:53.235 --> 01:36:54.778
Not the sheep.

785
01:36:56.822 --> 01:37:00.159
Now, if any of you feel
the need to follow the code

786
01:37:00.242 --> 01:37:02.703
of the Fraternity to the letter,

787
01:37:04.705 --> 01:37:07.291
I invite you to take your gun,

788
01:37:07.374 --> 01:37:10.252
put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.

789
01:37:14.339 --> 01:37:16.549
That is what Wesley demands.

790
01:37:18.218 --> 01:37:19.594
Otherwise,

791
01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.096
shoot this motherfucker

792
01:37:22.180 --> 01:37:25.475
and let us take our
Fraternity of Assassins to heights

793
01:37:25.558 --> 01:37:28.186
reserved only for the gods of men.

794
01:37:32.065 --> 01:37:33.483
You choose.

795
01:37:48.538 --> 01:37:50.123
Fuck the code.

796
01:38:53.893 --> 01:38:55.729
Sloan!

797
01:39:20.919 --> 01:39:23.422
Sloan!

798
01:39:39.896 --> 01:39:43.608
<i>Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic.</i>

799
01:39:45.735 --> 01:39:47.361
<i>Just like you.</i>

800
01:39:50.573 --> 01:39:52.241
<i>But who am I now?</i>

801
01:39:54.744 --> 01:39:56.371
<i>Account manager?</i>

802
01:39:58.748 --> 01:40:00.083
<i>Assassin?</i>

803
01:40:02.085 --> 01:40:06.297
<i>Or just another tool who was
mind-fucked into killing his father?</i>

804
01:40:08.298 --> 01:40:09.966
<i>I am all of these.</i>

805
01:40:11.218 --> 01:40:12.928
<i>And I am none of these.</i>

806
01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.265
<i>Who am I now?</i>

807
01:40:48.712 --> 01:40:51.340
<i>This is not me fulfilling my destiny.</i>

808
01:40:56.512 --> 01:40:59.515
<i>This is not me following
in my father's footsteps.</i>

809
01:41:04.019 --> 01:41:06.980
<i>This is definitely not me saving the world.</i>

810
01:41:25.623 --> 01:41:28.376
Still trying to figure out who you are?

811
01:41:29.544 --> 01:41:31.629
<i>This is not me.</i>

812
01:41:34.507 --> 01:41:37.050
<i>This is just a motherfucking decoy.</i>

813
01:41:43.682 --> 01:41:45.058
Oh, fuck.

814
01:41:49.563 --> 01:41:51.982
<i>This is me taking control.</i>

815
01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.027
<i>From Sloan,</i>

816
01:41:55.819 --> 01:41:57.696
<i>from the Fraternity,</i>

817
01:41:58.071 --> 01:42:01.575
<i>from Janice, from billing reports,</i>

818
01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:04.368
<i>from ergonomic keyboards,</i>

819
01:42:04.452 --> 01:42:08.122
<i>from cheating girlfriends
and sack-of-shit best friends.</i>

820
01:42:09.916 --> 01:42:12.752
<i>This is me taking back control</i>

821
01:42:13.503 --> 01:42:15.046
<i>of my life.</i>

822
01:42:18.716 --> 01:42:21.093
What the fuck have you done lately?
