5
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.959
It's
my anorexic boss's birthday.

6
00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.712
This means there's a certain
amount of interoffice pressure...

7
00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.755
to stand around
the conference table...

8
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:31.675
eating crappy food
and pretending to worship her.

9
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.137
Mmm. Oh, that's so good.

10
00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:39.558
Acting for five minutes like Janice
doesn't make all our lives miserable...

11
00:01:39.725 --> 00:01:42.561
is the hardest work
I'll do all day.

12
00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:48.066
I wanna know
who gave me this present.

13
00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.737
My job title is account manager.

14
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.615
I used to be called
an account service representative,

15
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.700
but a consultant told us...

16
00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:01.788
we needed to manage our clients
and not service them.

17
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.166
Yes. Yes.

18
00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.671
I have a girlfriend
whom I neither manage nor service.

19
00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:11.798
That's my best friend Barry
fucking her...

20
00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:16.345
on an IKEA kitchen table
I picked up for a really good price.

21
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.850
I'm finding it hard to
care about anything these days.

22
00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.810
In fact, the only thing
I do care about...

23
00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.396
is the fact that I can't
care about anything.

24
00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.732
Seriously, it worries me.

25
00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.570
My name is Wesley Gibson.

26
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.786
My dad walked out on my mom
when I was seven days old.

27
00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:44.032
Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked
into my baby blue eyes and asked himself,

28
00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:50.712
"Did I just father the most insignificant
asshole of the 21st century?”

29
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.983
But if you could get
the consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah.

30
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.860
Do you have the numbers
in front of you?

31
00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:16.988
Kim.

32
00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.492
Kim, are you there?

33
00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.458
Relax. If your name had
come up, you'd be dead already.

34
00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.674
We've had some unexpected losses recently.

35
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:40.470
We'd like to know
where our competitor...

36
00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:42.264
is getting his munition.

37
00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.567
It's clean.

38
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.068
Meaning?

39
00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.280
Meaning it's untraceable.

40
00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.133
Your competitor's very smart.

41
00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:01.783
Get down!

42
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:20.302
Fuck.

43
00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:50.267
No one leaves
the Fraternity, Cross.

44
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:54.020
I have a new
perspective on the Fraternity.

45
00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:59.609
Careful. You don't destroy something
that's been around for a thousand years.

46
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:02.696
It's already
destroyed. He broke the code.

47
00:06:02.863 --> 00:06:04.739
I have to stop this.

48
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.784
Really?
You know this.

49
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:10.704
So why don't you
face me yourself?

50
00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.834
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

51
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.004
They were just the decoys.

52
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.964
Good-bye, Mr. X.

53
00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.709
Never send sheep to kill a wolf.

54
00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.669
They were just the decoys.

55
00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:04.799
Wesley.
What is it?

56
00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.802
What do you mean,
what is it? Listen.

57
00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:13.767
How am I supposed to
sleep with all that fucking racket?

58
00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:17.604
When are we gonna move so
we don't have to wake up to that shit?

59
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.482
I kinda like it.

60
00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:24.361
It helps to drown out
the sound of your annoying fucking voice.

61
00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.404
Now please, let me sleep.

62
00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.032
Have you even thought
about our talk?

63
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.200
Yeah.

64
00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:32.911
Which one?

65
00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:36.581
Perfect. That's perfect.

66
00:07:36.748 --> 00:07:39.000

billing report sitting on your desk.

77
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:41.521
I want that report

78
00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:44.816
Okay, everybody. We're
all gonna stay an extra hour.

79
00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.110
Wanna hear something sad?

80
00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:51.781
I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep
my repetitive stress syndrome in check.

81
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.701
Just the fact that I repeat something
enough that it causes me stress

82
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:56.202
is fucking sad.

83
00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.663
Nice job, dude.
Seen Barry?

84
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.460
He had to go to the dentist.
Again.

85
00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:07.297
Yes. Oh. Oh. Barry.

86
00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.888
You think they have that
morning-after pill here?

87
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:17.474
That thing works. Crush it, put it in
her omelet. "Hey, baby, breakfast in bed."

88
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.392
Can never be too safe.

89
00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.519
Oh, God.

90
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:24.564
I lost my wallet somewhere.

91
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.611
Is all this together?

92
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.613
No. No...
Yes.

93
00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:35.366
He is the man.

94
00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.285
How much is it?
Oh. Plus this.

95
00:09:37.452 --> 00:09:40.038
It's 20.42.

96
00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:43.291
Watermelon.

97
00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:44.834
Chicks dig it.

98
00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:49.589
Thanks.

99
00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.633
See you next time.
Have a good night.

100
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.760
I love these energy drinks, man.

101
00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.846
I'm almost, like, kind of
on an energy drink cleanse...

102
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.774
where I do one for breakfast
and then, like, two or three for lunch...

103
00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.768
I'm the man?

104
00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.395
Yeah,
right, Barry. I'm the man.

105
00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:07.416
In fact, I'm so much the man I have
a standing prescription for medication...

106
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.443
to control my anxiety attacks.

107
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.113
God, I wish I had
something else to relieve my stress.

108
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.115
Hello, Wesley.

109
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.703
You know there are people...
Beautiful people...

110
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.499
You just wish they could see you in
a different setting, a different place,

111
00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.960
instead of where you are,
what you've become.

112
00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.462
Nicole is so hot.

113
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:31.548
What?

114
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.550
Boom goes the dynamite.

115
00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:35.844
But most of all,

116
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.639
you wish you weren't such a pussy for
wishing for things that'll never change.

117
00:10:43.434 --> 00:10:46.396
Good God a'mighty, you're
over here like it's spring fuckin' break,

118
00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.190
and I still don't have
that billing report.

119
00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.026
Why do I even keep you
around, Wesley?

120
00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:54.113
I'll get it done, Janice.

121
00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.239
Oh,
like I never heard that before.

122
00:10:56.406 --> 00:10:58.158
"I'll get it done.

Well, don't you have
anything to say for yourself?

I'm sorry.

128
00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:24.100
You're worthless. I'm
the one who's sorry I hired you.

thing is about the end of the day?

150
00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.447
I knew your father.

151
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:49.954
My father left
the week I was born, so...

152
00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:53.875

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.418
Sorry.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:03.843
Uh, look, the liquor aisle's
just over there, so...

155
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.846
Your father was one of
the greatest assassins who ever lived.

156
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:09.333
- The man who killed him is behind you.

157

Hey.
Sorry. Sorry.

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.633
Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. What the fuck just happened?

160
00:16:12.763 --> 00:16:14.599

please drive faster.

guy off, but let me out and call the cops.

166

Holy shit. You're gonna kill us.

167
00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.297
Oh! Shit. Shit.

168
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.932
I think we lost him. Could
you let me out at the next corner, please?

169
00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit!

170
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:03.606
Oh, fuck.

171
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.486
Oh, shit.

172
00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.323

173
00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.756
Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm just an accountant.

174
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.258
Whoa. Whoa.

175
00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:34.428
He's fucking persistent,
you know?

176
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.057
What the fuck?

177
00:17:44.981 --> 00:17:46.857
You kick his ass.

178
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.990
Just shoot him.

179
00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:58.202
What are you doing? What
are you shooting our car for? Huh?

180
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.373
- Are you crazy?
- Grab the wheel.

181
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.375
Oh, sh... Where are you going?

182
00:18:06.127 --> 00:18:08.004
Whoa. You just...
Get back in here.

183
00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:13.259
Oh, God.

184
00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.393

00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.579

187
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.667
- Under the seat.

188
00:18:49.754 --> 00:18:51.756

I don't have any money.

208

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.102
Taller?

00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:55.439
Uh, sir... Uh, sir?

212
00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:58.668
I've... I've been trying to explain to
the lady here that I-I'm an accountant...

213
00:21:58.692 --> 00:22:00.778
I'm an account service
representative...

214
00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:03.155
I'm... I'm an account manager.

215
00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:07.034
And... And I'm sure that if
you called my boss, Janice, she'd...

216
00:22:07.201 --> 00:22:09.203
She'd fill you in on
whatever has gone wrong.

217
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.456

e-mail. She'd put you straight.

00:22:12.623 --> 00:22:14.667
Shoot the wings off the flies.

219
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:17.561
I don't...
I don't know what that means.

220
00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:22.341
Shoot the wings off the flies.

221
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.391
I really think you have me
mixed up with somebody else.

222
00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:33.561
On three.

223
00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:36.313
Either you shoot, or I do.

224
00:22:45.239 --> 00:22:48.284
One.

225
00:22:51.412 --> 00:22:53.914
Okay.

226
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:02.548
Two.
I can't even see them.

227
00:23:07.052 --> 00:23:08.888
Three.

228
00:23:25.696 --> 00:23:28.699
Okay. Okay.

229
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.418
Holy shit.

230
00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:50.638
That's impossible.

231
00:23:50.804 --> 00:23:54.725
A lot of things for
you were impossible before today.

232
00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:58.729
What you experienced,
Wesley, was not a panic attack.

233
00:23:58.896 --> 00:24:02.107
Your heart was beating in
excess of 400 beats per minute,

234
00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:05.611
sending abundant amounts of
adrenaline into your bloodstream.

235
00:24:05.778 --> 00:24:08.739
This allows you to see
and react faster than normal.

236
00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:11.659
Only a few people
in the world can do that.

237
00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:14.578
Your father could do it,
and you can do it.

238
00:24:16.497 --> 00:24:18.778
With a little work you can
learn to control these attacks.

239
00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:20.542
Stay away from me.

240
00:24:22.127 --> 00:24:25.255
Just stay back from me.
I... I have a gun, sir.

241
00:24:25.422 --> 00:24:26.465
All right?

242
00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:30.302
My name is Sloan.

243
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.304
This is Fox.

244
00:24:32.471 --> 00:24:35.432
And the others you see
around you are all very good at killing.

245
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.560
So if I were you I'd
keep the gun pointed at me.

246
00:24:38.727 --> 00:24:41.605
You don't want to point
it at any of them. That's better.

247
00:24:41.772 --> 00:24:43.691
You're insane.
No.

248
00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.776
Insanity is wasting
your life as a nothing...

249
00:24:45.943 --> 00:24:48.362
when you have the blood
of a killer flowing in your veins.

250
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:51.615
Insanity is being shit on,
beat down,

251
00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:54.410
coasting through life
in a miserable existence...

252
00:24:54.576 --> 00:24:57.579
when you have a caged lion
locked inside and the key to release it.

253
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:03.627
This gun you're holding is an Imanishi
17. It belonged to your father.

254
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.090
He could conduct
a symphony orchestra with it.

255
00:25:08.257 --> 00:25:12.136
And you're going to use it to kill
the man who shot him down in cold blood.

256
00:25:12.302 --> 00:25:13.303
I can't...

257
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.682
The same man
who tried to kill you tonight.

258
00:25:18.684 --> 00:25:20.728
Your father was one of us...

259
00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:23.439
A fraternity of assassins.

260
00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:26.108
The Weapons of Fate.

261
00:25:26.275 --> 00:25:29.194
We've transferred all
of his assets over to you,

262
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.322
and let me assure you,
they are substantial.

263
00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:37.161
It is your
long-awaited destiny...

264
00:25:38.704 --> 00:25:40.039
to join us.

265
00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:52.384
I—...

266
00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.678
Back off. Back off.

267
00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:57.848
You... You don't know
anything about me.

268
00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:01.477
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.

269
00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:04.188
You stay away from me?

270
00:26:04.354 --> 00:26:07.691
You stay away from me, please?
Will you let me through?

271
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:42.142
[ Wesley Narrating I You know when
you have a dream and you're half awake,

272
00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:45.270
but it's still
on the fringe of your brain,

273
00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:48.077
and then you open your eyes and
you're so damn glad it was a dream?

274
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:58.826
This was nothing like that.

275
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.980
Sorry. Could you just
give me one second? Thank you.

276
00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:39.867

278
00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:54.715
Hey.

279
00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:57.801

What do you mean?

280
00:27:58.802 --> 00:28:00.804

You're here early.

a little pepped up. You all right?

283
00:28:07.895 --> 00:28:08.937
Well, yeah.

284
00:28:10.397 --> 00:28:12.274
Yeah.

285
00:28:12.441 --> 00:28:13.942
I guess I feel...

286
00:28:15.152 --> 00:28:17.279
kinda different.

287
00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:20.073
Whatever. I'm gonna go get
some Post-It notes. Do you want one?

288
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.617

got your review coming up next week.

293
00:28:49.019 --> 00:28:52.981
And I can't wait to start
checking me off some big fucking boxes.

294
00:28:53.148 --> 00:28:55.067
Attitude: Poor.

295
00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:56.985
Performance: Poor.

296
00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:59.404
Management skills: Poor.

a fucking joke.

298
00:29:03.659 --> 00:29:06.536

303
00:29:27.766 --> 00:29:30.852
- You don't need this.

304
00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:35.649
I understand.

305
00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:39.987
Junior high
must have been kinda tough.

306
00:29:40.153 --> 00:29:43.949

treat your workers like horseshit, Janice.

308

doughnuts in the top drawer of your desk.

such a bitch,

I do feel sorry for you.

the way you behave...

00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:30.050
This is a textile mill,

353
00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:31.843
and a damn good one.

354
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.846
Yeah, that's cute.
But that's bullshit, right?

355
00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:37.224
All these guys
are killers, aren't they?

356
00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:43.021
I think you owe me some answers.

357
00:33:43.188 --> 00:33:45.440
All right, clearly
I-I don't understand, but...

358
00:33:45.607 --> 00:33:48.318
Do you make sweaters,
or do you kill people?

359
00:34:09.047 --> 00:34:10.733
That's an awful lot
of questions over coffee.

360
00:34:21.017 --> 00:34:23.311
Are you sure you're ready
for the answers?

361
00:34:23.478 --> 00:34:25.897
Yes, I-I'm sure.

362
00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:29.442
I can't go back.
Not to my life.

363
00:34:33.947 --> 00:34:35.907
He's all yours.

364
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:39.035
All right.
We're up.

365
00:34:48.628 --> 00:34:51.881
How you doin'?

366
00:34:52.048 --> 00:34:55.427
I'm the Repairman.
What do you repair?

367
00:34:55.594 --> 00:34:58.972
A lifetime...
of bad habits.

368
00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:01.683
Okay.
Will you do me a favor?

369
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.227
Mm-hmm.
Just put your arms behind your back.

370
00:35:04.394 --> 00:35:06.354
Uh... It's okay.

371
00:35:06.521 --> 00:35:08.523
- I don't know, um...
- Just behind your back.

372
00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.442
Is this okay?
Just relax.

373
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:12.444
Is this part of it?

374
00:35:13.987 --> 00:35:16.781
There we go.
You gonna put a bag over my head?

375
00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:19.909
No. There's no need
for a bag.

376
00:35:20.076 --> 00:35:23.413
That's not too tight, is it?
No, that's... nice.

377
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.966
- Why did you come here, Wesley?
- You brought me here. Remember?

378
00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:38.428
What the fuck'd you do that f...

379
00:35:55.362 --> 00:35:58.123
How many punches did the Repairman
throw before he was counting sheep?

380
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:04.162
Well, I haven't spent a lot of
time having my face smashed in before.

381
00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:06.373
All right? You spend
a lot of time with knives?

382
00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:08.583
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

383
00:36:11.002 --> 00:36:13.004
Fuck.

384
00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:18.093
It was a rhetorical question,
culo.

385
00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:22.263
You interrupt me again,
I use the business end.

386
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:24.516
Here's what you need to know,
puto.

387
00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:27.352
Knives... are easy to hide.

388
00:36:28.978 --> 00:36:31.147
They don't jam,
and they never run out of bullets.

389
00:36:32.982 --> 00:36:34.901
They come in handy...

390
00:36:35.068 --> 00:36:37.821
when you gotta do
some close contact work.

391
00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:40.323
What the fuck, man?

392
00:36:46.413 --> 00:36:48.206
Come here.

393
00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:50.208
What?
Come here.

394
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:53.294
Try to cut me.
What?

395
00:36:54.713 --> 00:36:56.548
Try to cut me.

396
00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.591
Hey. Just...

397
00:36:58.758 --> 00:37:00.510
Be careful with that.
That's sharp.

398
00:37:01.803 --> 00:37:03.471
Just stick and stick and...

399
00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:07.350
Why? Seriously, man. I could hurt you.
Hey.

400
00:37:07.517 --> 00:37:10.145
Okay. Pussy.
I'm not a pussy.

401
00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:12.230
You're a pussy.
No, I'm not a pussy.

402
00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:14.315
You're a pussy.
I'm not a pussy.

403
00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:16.293
I got a healthy respect for the human
condition.

404
00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:17.694
Fuck that. You're a pussy.

405
00:37:17.861 --> 00:37:20.613
I'm not a pussy. I'm not a pussy.
You're a pussy. Come on, pussy.

406
00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.680
Hi. How are you doing?

407
00:37:45.847 --> 00:37:48.475
Get the... Fuck.

408
00:37:48.641 --> 00:37:50.518
The fuck...
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

409
00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:52.395
Just a moment.
Just a moment.

410
00:37:52.562 --> 00:37:54.105
Pardon. Sorry.

411
00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:55.416
33 I Singing, Foreign Language I

412
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.943
Hello? Hey.
Hey, come back. Hey.

413
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.904
You must drink.
Drink, yeah.

414
00:38:08.495 --> 00:38:10.371
What is this?

415
00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:12.540
This is the recovery room.

416
00:38:12.707 --> 00:38:17.170
This bath stimulates white
blood cells and speeds up the process.

417
00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:20.465
In here bruises, cuts,
breaks heal in hours, not days.

418
00:38:20.632 --> 00:38:23.134
- You shitting me?
- Shh.

419
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:26.387
What is that, vodka?
Yeah.

420
00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:28.640
- Are you Russian?
- Yeah.

421
00:38:29.557 --> 00:38:30.558
Get up.

422
00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.270
This is the Gunsmith.

423
00:38:34.437 --> 00:38:37.677
He knows more about a piece than anybody,
and he's gonna teach you how to use one.

424
00:38:39.317 --> 00:38:40.902
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good.

425
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:42.695
Good.

426
00:38:42.862 --> 00:38:46.074
You know Seltzer broke his leg.
Oh. Really?

427
00:38:46.241 --> 00:38:48.159
Yeah.
In three places.

428
00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:50.119
Hmm. How'd he do it?

429
00:38:50.286 --> 00:38:53.957
Jumped off a building.

430
00:38:54.123 --> 00:38:56.334
So, is he all right?
Yeah. He's pretty bad, though.

431
00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:59.045
Oh, my God.

432
00:38:59.212 --> 00:39:02.257
Oh, my God, you guys,
that is so realistic.

433
00:39:04.425 --> 00:39:08.388
Been in recovery three days. They say
they're not even gonna let him out.

434
00:39:08.555 --> 00:39:13.309
Who is Seltzer?

435
00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.274
He worked in the cafeteria.
He made the good sandwiches.

436
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.693
Oh, my God.

437
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.029
Oh, my G... Oh, my God!

438
00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:28.199
We can't shoot a dead
woman. She might be somebody's mom.

439
00:39:30.743 --> 00:39:34.247
You need to know what
it's like to put a bullet in a body.

440
00:39:34.414 --> 00:39:37.625
Why are you here?

441
00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:40.795
You know, I thought I was learning
to be some kind of super assassin.

442
00:39:42.005 --> 00:39:43.882
Huh?

443
00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:48.261
If I want to get beat up, I-I-I would
have stayed in my cubicle. You know?

444
00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:56.019
Fuck.

445
00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:10.992
All right, shoot the target... from there.

446
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.704
You want me
to shoot through Wilbur.

447
00:40:14.871 --> 00:40:17.832
I want you to curve the bullet.
Wh...

448
00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:20.126
How am I supposed to do that?

449
00:40:20.293 --> 00:40:22.962
It's not a question of "how."

450
00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:25.256
It's a question of "what.”

451
00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:28.468
If no one told you
that bullets flew straight...

452
00:40:28.635 --> 00:40:33.014
and I gave you a gun and told
you to hit the target, what would you do?

453
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:35.600
Let your instincts guide you.

454
00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:52.450
How the hell did he do that?

455
00:40:52.617 --> 00:40:54.661
Can you do that?
Can you do that? Hello?

456
00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.497
Mmm.

457
00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:00.612
Hey, I think
that's my old train.

458
00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:02.293
Still is.

459
00:41:08.758 --> 00:41:11.260
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

460
00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:13.388
Shit. Shit.

461
00:41:13.554 --> 00:41:15.640
- Fucking asshole.
- Come on.

462
00:41:19.769 --> 00:41:21.688
Let's go.

463
00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:23.648
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

464
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:37.745
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

465
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.373
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

466
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.710
No. No. No.

Oh, God, I feel... I feel...

469
00:42:00.143 --> 00:42:01.853
I feel... I feel...

470
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.771
I-I feel kinda good.

471
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:16.659
He got Rictus. Perfect shot.
Impossible angle.

472
00:42:16.826 --> 00:42:18.911
Cross is taking us out
one by one.

473
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:27.670
And Wesley is the only one
who can get to him.

474
00:42:29.505 --> 00:42:31.674
Cross gets closer
with each hour.

475
00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:35.219
Get back to work.

476
00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:41.225
- See that?
- Uh-huh.

477
00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.019
- It's a shuttle.
- Okay.

478
00:42:44.353 --> 00:42:45.980
I want you to try and catch it.

479
00:42:47.857 --> 00:42:49.337
You want me to
stick my hand in there.

480
00:42:49.692 --> 00:42:51.152
Yes.
I want you to catch it.

481
00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:52.320
Wh...

482
00:42:57.325 --> 00:42:59.327
Aaah! Whoo.

483
00:43:01.287 --> 00:43:04.582
Wanna put a gun to my head?
I can slow things down like with the fly.

484
00:43:04.749 --> 00:43:07.960
You need to learn
to control that by yourself.

485
00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.434
Fuck!

486
00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:27.688
This is bullshit.
Fuck this.

487
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:40.118
How's it going today, Wesley?

488
00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.954
No, fuck the loom
and fuck the Repairman.

489
00:43:43.121 --> 00:43:45.957
I can shoot the wings
off the back of a fly. I'm ready.

490
00:43:46.124 --> 00:43:48.960
You're ready
when Fox says you're ready.

People think you use cheese
to catch these beauties.

But they go ape-shit
for peanut butter.

fan of this.

Hey. Hey, Russian.

503
00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:41.304
Good for one, yeah?

504
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.890
Imagine if you had a thousand.

505
00:44:45.766 --> 00:44:48.561
They really fucked you up, didn't they?

506
00:44:48.728 --> 00:44:51.314
What the hell
did they do to you?

507
00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.357

It's bullshit. Huh?
Bullshit.

512
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:15.504
Repairman, five minutes.

513
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:20.009
Heads up out of the question?

514
00:45:27.683 --> 00:45:30.144
You're wasting my
fucking time. Why are you here?

515
00:45:30.311 --> 00:45:31.771
I don't know.
So hit me.

516
00:45:41.322 --> 00:45:44.659
- Why are you here?
- I had a shit life. So why wouldn't I?

517
00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.872
I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

518

Don't know
what you want me to say.

519

- Why are you here?
- I don't know.

Why are you here?

00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:02.551
- Why are you here?
- I don't know why I'm here.

Why are you here?

523
00:46:08.057 --> 00:46:09.809
Why are you here?

I said I don't know who I am.

who you are?

went rogue.

of finding out who you are.

To kill Cross,

555
00:49:01.063 --> 00:49:04.525
the man who betrayed
the Fraternity and murdered my father,

556
00:49:04.692 --> 00:49:06.360
I must prepare.

557
00:49:06.527 --> 00:49:10.364
I have to become his student,
memorize every move he ever made,

558
00:49:10.531 --> 00:49:12.783
every attack he ever executed...

559
00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:22.418
When he dropped a patient
in an airtight room...

560
00:49:22.585 --> 00:49:25.171
surrounded
by Secret Service agents,

561
00:49:25.337 --> 00:49:28.174
when he took out
that businessman in the elevator,

562
00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.843
his bullets untraceable,
of course.

563
00:49:32.636 --> 00:49:34.555
Or how no matter
what the weapon...

564
00:49:34.722 --> 00:49:36.682
or how he eliminated his target,

565
00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:41.645
he was always
one chess move ahead,

566
00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.690
one move more prepared,

567
00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:46.984
one step quicker,

568
00:49:47.151 --> 00:49:48.777
one shot more precise.

569
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.739
In fact, in all my research,

570
00:49:51.906 --> 00:49:55.034
I found that he never
missed a target.

571
00:49:55.201 --> 00:49:56.702
Not until me.

00:50:26.065 --> 00:50:28.025
Aaah!

00:51:03.936 --> 00:51:05.604
Yeah!

574
00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:07.731
Yes.

For the first time in
your life, Wesley, you're in control.

You're crazy.

578
00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:42.052
Welcome to the Fraternity.

579
00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:57.025
We call this the Loom of Fate.

580
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.831
After today,

581
00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:13.125

in here again.

Why not?

583
00:54:15.377 --> 00:54:17.546
Because, like an apostle,

584
00:54:17.713 --> 00:54:20.716
your task is not to interpret,

585
00:54:20.883 --> 00:54:22.718
but to deliver.

586
00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:27.848
Every culture
in history has a secret code...

587
00:54:28.015 --> 00:54:30.851
One you won't find
in traditional texts.

588
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.313
A thousand years ago,

589
00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:39.318
a clan of weavers discovered
a mystical language hidden in the fabric.

590
00:54:39.485 --> 00:54:43.447
They called themselves
the Fraternity.

591
00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:46.742
I'll be honest with you.
All I see are threads.

592
00:54:46.909 --> 00:54:48.744
Come here.

593
00:54:52.623 --> 00:54:54.958
Look there.

594
00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:58.796
You see that one thread that missed
the weave and lies on top of the others?

595
00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:01.632
Like a mistake?
No. It's a code.

596
00:55:02.966 --> 00:55:04.718
If the vertical thread
is on top,

597
00:55:04.885 --> 00:55:07.137
it's a one.

598
00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:10.599
If it's below, it's a zero.

599
00:55:10.766 --> 00:55:12.267
Binary code?

600
00:55:12.434 --> 00:55:15.521
- What's it say?
- It's a name.

601
00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:19.399
A target.

602
00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:23.195
Where do the names come from?

603
00:55:24.738 --> 00:55:27.199
They come out
of a necessity, Wesley.

604
00:55:27.366 --> 00:55:30.911
A necessity to maintain
balance in the world.

605
00:55:31.078 --> 00:55:33.789
They are orders
that must be executed,

606
00:55:33.956 --> 00:55:36.667
entrusted to us so that we...

607
00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:39.753
might forge stability
out of chaos.

608
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:44.091

you deliver.

00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:09.491
You want me to kill
Robert Deane Darden?

616
00:56:12.327 --> 00:56:15.455
Not me. Fate.

617
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.718
The target will be in the conference
room sitting at the head chair.

618
00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:31.638
There are six windows.
You will shoot through the fifth.

619
00:56:42.357 --> 00:56:44.151
Fifth window.

620
00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:51.909

621
00:57:15.182 --> 00:57:18.727
What did he do
that he deserves to die?

622
00:57:20.187 --> 00:57:22.272
You don't know.

623
00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:26.818
I don't know if he was bad.
I don't know if he was evil.

624
00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:29.071
I don't know anything about him.

625
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:34.660
We get our orders
from a loom... fate.

626
00:57:34.826 --> 00:57:36.995
And we're supposed to
take it on faith...

627
00:57:37.162 --> 00:57:39.414
that what we're doing is right.

628
00:57:40.916 --> 00:57:42.960
Killing someone
we know nothing about.

629
00:57:45.921 --> 00:57:48.048
I don't know if I can do that.

630
00:58:00.644 --> 00:58:04.982
About 20 years ago,
there was this girl.

631
00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:09.987
Her dad was a federal judge.

632
00:58:10.153 --> 00:58:13.865
So she probably had it in her mind that
she was gonna follow in his footsteps.

633
00:58:19.955 --> 00:58:22.374
So she's home one Christmas,

634
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:25.043
and her dad's on this big
racketeering case.

635
00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.629
The defendants want to
get a softer judge,

636
00:58:28.964 --> 00:58:30.590
one they can buy off.

637
00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:34.094
So they hired this guy,

638
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:37.139
Max Petrich.

639
00:58:38.557 --> 00:58:41.309
Get him to pay
her father a visit.

640
00:58:44.479 --> 00:58:46.398
And the way he pays
people a visit...

641
00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:50.610
is to break in...

642
00:58:52.154 --> 00:58:54.239
and tie up their loved ones...

643
00:58:54.406 --> 00:58:56.158
and force them to watch...

644
00:58:57.868 --> 00:59:01.038
while he burns
his targets alive.

645
00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:13.842
And then he takes a wire
hanger and twists it round...

646
00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:16.053
and brands his initials
into each one of them...

647
00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.929
so they will never, ever forget.

648
00:59:24.061 --> 00:59:27.022
After I was recruited
into the Fraternity,

649
00:59:27.189 --> 00:59:30.442
I found out
that Max Petrich's name had come up...

650
00:59:30.609 --> 00:59:34.029
weeks before
the federal judge was killed...

651
00:59:34.196 --> 00:59:36.448
and that a Fraternity member...

652
00:59:36.615 --> 00:59:39.743
had failed to pull the trigger.

653
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:44.081
We don't know how far...

654
00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:46.208

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:16.718
It was made by this man.
His name's Pekwarsky.

703
01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:19.637
He works out of what is now
a monastery in Eastern Moravia.

704
01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.141
This place is where
the Fraternity was born.

705
01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.064
He's taunting me.

706
01:08:30.231 --> 01:08:33.526
He's sending me a message.
I'm gonna send him one back.

707
01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.903
He's trapping you.

708
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:38.823
Leading you to a place
he knows very well.

709
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:41.659
Look, I know this. I...

710
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.120
This is what you trained me for.

711
01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.539
You can't go alone.

712
01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:50.251
I go alone,
or he doesn't show. He's not stupid.

713
01:08:50.418 --> 01:08:54.547
Look, a member of
the Fraternity is dead because of me.

714
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.347
Okay.

715
01:09:03.556 --> 01:09:05.433
Go.

716
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:10.146
Thank you.

717
01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.323
I don't think
that's a good idea.

718
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:32.418
Your next assignment.

719
01:10:31.853 --> 01:10:33.688
Pekwarsky?

720
01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:49.871
Shit.

721
01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:00.506
What are you doing here?

722
01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:02.467
Lower your gun.

723
01:11:12.059 --> 01:11:13.895
You recognize this?

724
01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:16.939
I pulled this out
of my shoulder.

725
01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.609
The guy who put it there
killed my father.

726
01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:22.278
Now, I know you made it,
so tell me where he is.

727
01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:25.490
I did mold this, but I can't be
responsible for the people who use them.

728
01:11:25.656 --> 01:11:28.075
I don't give a shit.
Tell me where he is.

729
01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.411
Look at my finger.

730
01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:35.666
I... can try
and arrange a meet.

731
01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.900
Have you ever thought about
doing things differently?

732
01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:02.860
How do you mean?

733
01:12:03.027 --> 01:12:04.403
I don't know.

734
01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.950
Being... Being somebody else?

735
01:12:09.116 --> 01:12:11.577
Somebody normal.

736
01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.877
No.

737
01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.510
Shit.

738
01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.345
Out of the way.

739
01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.753
Stay. Stay.

740
01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:23.649
Hey. Hey.

741
01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.361
He's on the train.

742
01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:31.115
He's alone.
Thank you.

743
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.471
Get up.
Aaah.

744
01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.806
Sorry. Sir, sit down.

745
01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:58.559
Sir, sit down.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

746
01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.270
Sir. Sir, sit down.
Sir, sit down.

747
01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:16.869
Get out of the way. Sit
down. Stay down. Sit down.

748
01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:19.121
Sit down.
It's okay. Sit down.

749
01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.800
Wesley.

750
01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:41.268
Out of the way.
Out of the way.

751
01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:55.468
No. No, no, no, no.

752
01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:32.750
Wesley, listen to me.

753
01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.836
Shut the fuck up.

754
01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:39.423
You don't get to talk to me.
You don't get to talk to me.

755
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:42.509
Everything they told you
was a lie.

756
01:18:42.676 --> 01:18:45.221
Shut up, you lying piece
of shit. You shut the fuck up.

757
01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:50.434
You are my son.

758
01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:56.857
What did you s...
What did you say to me?

759
01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.225
Is it true?

760
01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.229
Yes.

761
01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:40.901
Why did you make me do this?

762
01:19:41.068 --> 01:19:43.779
Because you are
the only person he wouldn't kill.

763
01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:51.453
You knew, goddamn it.

764
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.456
You knew the entire time.

765
01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.041
Well, his name came up.

766
01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.378
So did yours.

767
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:49.887
No, it was awful. Never mind.

768
01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:53.349
No. No.
It was complete shit.

769
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:15.287
I promised your father
I'd bring you back here.

770
01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:18.082
What the fuck?

771
01:21:18.248 --> 01:21:20.626
He said it was
the only way you'd believe.

772
01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.845
Your father was never more
than a camera click away.

773
01:21:48.487 --> 01:21:50.322
That's me.

774
01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:56.370
He was my father,

775
01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.582
and I killed him.

776
01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:05.421
To your father, protecting
you was worth giving up his life.

777
01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:08.048
Protect me?

778
01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:10.092
He was trying to
fucking kill me.

779
01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:13.429
No. He wasn't trying
to kill you.

780
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.807
He was trying to rescue you.

781
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.649
When Cross left the Fraternity,

782
01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:27.526
Sloan hunted you down.

783
01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:31.697
Ever since Fox
had her teeth in you,

784
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:34.324
he's been trying to
separate you from them.

785
01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:40.706
Your father never wanted you
in the Fraternity, Wesley.

786
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.543
He wanted
a different path for you...

787
01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:53.051
with things that he could never have.

788
01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:54.595
A home.

789
01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:57.723
Peace.

790
01:22:57.890 --> 01:23:01.393
He hoped you would find
your own way.

791
01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:11.153
Your father got hold of this.

792
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.655
Decipher it yourself.

793
01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:25.209
Sloan began manufacturing
targets of his own for profit years ago.

794
01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:29.963
Your father found out about it.

795
01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:32.370
And he was gonna do something
about it on his own, right?

796
01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:35.636
But Sloan turned everyone
against him.

797
01:23:35.802 --> 01:23:37.363
My father's name never
even came up, did it?

798
01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:38.514
No.

799
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.724
Holding to the code
made him a target.

800
01:23:45.354 --> 01:23:47.064
Yes.

801
01:24:01.453 --> 01:24:04.373
You want me to run?
No.

802
01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.333
I want you to live.

803
01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:11.129
You can have
a different life, Wesley,

804
01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:13.382
like your father wanted for you.

805
01:25:40.385 --> 01:25:41.720
We trained him well.

806
01:26:26.556 --> 01:26:28.785
[ Wesley Narrating I My
father was wrong about one thing.

807
01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:31.019
Everything they told me
wasn't a lie.

808
01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:32.729
They taught me how to Kill,

809
01:26:32.896 --> 01:26:34.940
how to feel no pain,

810
01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:39.569
and most importantly,
that every job has a perfect weapon.

811
01:26:42.489 --> 01:26:45.117
Well, I'm the perfect weapon.

812
01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:48.453
And I'm supposed to run?

813
01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.123
Nah, I've been doing that
my entire life.

814
01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:53.250
So I say no.

815
01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:58.046
I say kill 'em all
and let fate sort out the mess.

816
01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:54.144
Kill him.

817
01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:48.156
Do you see 'em?

818
01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:51.201
Do you see 'em?

819
01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:56.928
Aah.

820
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:00.682
Pussy.

821
01:32:01.808 --> 01:32:03.143
Pussy, pussy.

822
01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.908
Pussy, pussy.

823
01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:25.832
Pussy.

824
01:33:02.327 --> 01:33:03.745
Huh?

825
01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:34.526
Sloan!

826
01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:44.619
Hey.

827
01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:53.461
My father wasn't a traitor.

828
01:33:56.756 --> 01:33:58.591
This is a kill order.

829
01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:03.805
And it's got Sloan's name on it.

830
01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:08.977
What did you say to me?

831
01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:12.230
It's a name.
It's a... It's a target.

832
01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:17.944
I don't want this person dead.

833
01:34:18.111 --> 01:34:20.363
Fate does.

834
01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:25.869
Well, fate wanted you dead.

835
01:34:27.412 --> 01:34:29.414
And he couldn't take it,

836
01:34:29.581 --> 01:34:32.000
so he started manufacturing
his own targets...

837
01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:34.169
for his own gains.

838
01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.379
And that's when
my dad found out...

839
01:34:36.546 --> 01:34:39.048
and decided
to stand against him.

840
01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:43.011
And that's when
you sent a man's son...

841
01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:45.013
to kill his father.

842
01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:51.269
You're not an assassin
of fate, Sloan.

843
01:34:52.770 --> 01:34:54.898
You're just a thug
who can bend bullets.

844
01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:13.374
Is that true?

845
01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:22.842
Here is what the truth is.

846
01:35:25.845 --> 01:35:27.430
Your name came up.

847
01:35:39.609 --> 01:35:41.277
Your name came up.

848
01:35:55.792 --> 01:35:57.543
Your name came up.

849
01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:01.965
Your name.

850
01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:06.177
Your name. Yours.

851
01:36:07.345 --> 01:36:10.181
Everyone in this room.

852
01:36:15.561 --> 01:36:18.523
If I had not done what I did,

853
01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:22.193
you would all be dead.

854
01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:26.864
I saved your lives.

855
01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:31.077
Now look where we are.

856
01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:33.955
We are stronger than ever,

857
01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:38.501
changing the course
of history as we see it,

858
01:36:38.668 --> 01:36:41.671
choosing the targets we select.

859
01:36:43.423 --> 01:36:45.967
We can redistribute power...

860
01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.636
where we see fit.

861
01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.055
The wolves rule,

862
01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:54.225
not the sheep.

863
01:36:56.436 --> 01:36:59.605
Now, if any of you feel
the need to follow...

864
01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:02.942
the code of the Fraternity
to the letter,

865
01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:08.531
I invite you to take
your gun, put it in your mouth...

866
01:37:08.698 --> 01:37:09.949
and pull the trigger.

867
01:37:14.203 --> 01:37:17.081
That is what Wesley demands.

868
01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:21.753
Otherwise,
shoot this motherfucker...

869
01:37:21.919 --> 01:37:24.797
and let us take
our fraternity of assassins...

870
01:37:24.964 --> 01:37:29.010
to heights reserved
only for the gods of men.

871
01:37:32.055 --> 01:37:33.848
You choose.

872
01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:49.697
Fuck the code.

873
01:38:53.803 --> 01:38:56.347
Sloan!

874
01:39:20.872 --> 01:39:24.083
Sloan!

875
01:39:40.099 --> 01:39:42.852
Six weeks ago, I was ordinary...

876
01:39:43.019 --> 01:39:44.353
and pathetic,

877
01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:47.190
just like you.

878
01:39:50.651 --> 01:39:52.653
But who am I now?

879
01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:58.618
- Account manager?

880
01:39:58.784 --> 01:40:02.079
Assassin?

881
01:40:02.246 --> 01:40:06.459
Or just another tool who was
mind-fucked into killing his father?

882
01:40:07.919 --> 01:40:09.712
