WEBVTT

1
00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:03.512
You know, showboating like that
just makes you look desperate.

2
00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.348
Yeah, "Look at me.
I can flip my ski."

3
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:07.432
Pathetic.

4
00:05:07.558 --> 00:05:10.352
- Yeah.
- Daniel, that was awesome!

5
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:13.689
Nicole.

6
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:20.070
Hey, Daniel. Nicole left, huh?

7
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.739
Should've let me talk to her.

8
00:05:37.588 --> 00:05:39.047
I love it out here.

9
00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:43.760
The Big Dipper.

10
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.389
It's my favourite.

11
00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.725
- Do you know that one?
- No.

12
00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:52.477
I got a D in Astronomy.

13
00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:59.484
So, I never see you with anyone.

14
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.946
Do you have a girlfriend
out of town or something?

15
00:06:09.995 --> 00:06:12.080
Daniel? Daniel?

16
00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:23.258
I want you to feel this!

17
00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:26.094
This is what's coming for you.

18
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.848
Oh, God!

19
00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.058
Daniel, are you OK?

20
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.853
Oh, my God.

21
00:06:39.733 --> 00:06:42.861
He's a freak.
He's some kind of freak.

22
00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:29.867
Number Three's dead.

23
00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:32.452
You all right?

24
00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:36.415
Yeah.

25
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.791
Anyone else see what happened?

26
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:22.127
I told you not to keep this crap.
It just slows us down.

27
00:08:49.238 --> 00:08:50.906
All right, let's go.

28
00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.873
Daniel.

29
00:09:07.089 --> 00:09:10.801
This is the part I hate the most,
the running.

30
00:09:10.926 --> 00:09:14.096
But it's the only thing
in my life that's real.

31
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:15.973
The rest is a lie.

32
00:09:16.098 --> 00:09:18.225
Even Henri.

33
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.185
People think he's my father.

34
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.104
He's not.

35
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:26.441
He's a warrior from my planet,
assigned to keep me alive.

36
00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:29.987
I don't remember my father.

37
00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:33.198
All he left for me
was some kind of box.

38
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:35.993
Henri says he'll pass it on to me
when the time is right.

39
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.790
I got my first scar
when I was nine years old,

40
00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:44.376
near the border of Mexico.

41
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.628
It woke me from my sleep.

42
00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.089
It was the first sign
that the Mogadorians

43
00:09:49.214 --> 00:09:51.300
had found us here on Earth.

44
00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:55.053
The second scar came when I was 12.

45
00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:58.348
I was in Colorado,
in the middle of a spelling bee.

46
00:09:59.433 --> 00:10:02.644
As soon as I felt it,
I knew Number Two was dead.

47
00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.315
Last night, I got my third scar.

48
00:10:09.443 --> 00:10:13.655
I was just a kid when the Mogadorians
invaded my planet, Lorien.

49
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.742
Nine of us children escaped.

50
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:21.288
We were gifted, meant to protect
our people when we grew up.

51
00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:23.332
We never got the chance.

52
00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:25.000
Everyone was killed.

53
00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:28.462
We are the last of our kind.

54
00:10:29.213 --> 00:10:32.299
Three of us are gone. Dead.

55
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:37.054
They are hunting us down,
one by one, in order.

56
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.265
I know I'm next.

57
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.560
I am Number Four.

58
00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:44.811
All right, well, so...

59
00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:47.773
Daniel won't be in school
the rest of the semester.

60
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:50.317
OK. You, too.

61
00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.571
Your new ID.

62
00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.823
And this time,
you stay out of sight, huh?

63
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:58.951
No school, no teams, nothing.

64
00:10:59.076 --> 00:11:00.994
John Smith. Very original.

65
00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:04.373
I don't want to be original.
I want to be invisible.

66
00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:10.212
This time was different.

67
00:11:10.337 --> 00:11:12.256
I didn't just get a scar.

68
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:14.883
I... I saw Number Three.

69
00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:20.639
I felt the knife, I felt him die.
I could tell we all did.

70
00:11:22.057 --> 00:11:23.809
The others.

71
00:11:23.934 --> 00:11:25.227
We should get moving.

72
00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:28.313
Mogadorians could've
already picked up our scent.

73
00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:32.734
We're going to Paradise.
I have business to take care of.

74
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:42.888
It's Bernie Kosar.

75
00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:46.308
Played football.

76
00:12:50.229 --> 00:12:54.191
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.
- Good to know.

77
00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:57.611
- Next time, I get to pick the place.
- Yeah.

78
00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.353
That's all of it.
I'm going to bed.

79
00:13:31.478 --> 00:13:32.437
Hang on.

80
00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:35.148
I need a new picture.

81
00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:38.944
We have to wipe out anything
that hits the Internet.

82
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:40.863
Say "Paradise."

83
00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:49.621
Oh, shit.

84
00:13:49.746 --> 00:13:51.707
This is why I need you
to be invisible.

85
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.239
Get back inside.

86
00:14:26.241 --> 00:14:27.534
John.

87
00:14:27.659 --> 00:14:31.121
Come on. Come back inside.

88
00:14:40.756 --> 00:14:43.592
Little small for a Mogadorian,
don't you think?

89
00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:48.722
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

90
00:14:48.847 --> 00:14:51.225
He doesn't have any collar or tags.

91
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.103
Somebody, somewhere,
must miss you, huh?

92
00:14:56.939 --> 00:14:58.273
Come on.

93
00:14:58.398 --> 00:15:01.026
Another pair of eyes
and ears watching the house?

94
00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:03.320
I'm gonna need somebody to talk to.

95
00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:05.072
Talk to me.

96
00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:09.368
Yeah, keep the dog.

97
00:15:09.493 --> 00:15:10.827
What are you gonna call him?

98
00:15:12.329 --> 00:15:14.289
How about Bernie Kosar?

99
00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:54.848
- What are you doing up?
- Changed my mind.

100
00:16:55.933 --> 00:16:57.726
About what?

101
00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.771
Look, as much fun
as you are to be around,

102
00:17:00.896 --> 00:17:03.982
I can't be a prisoner.
I have to go to school.

103
00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:06.026
- No. No way, too risky.
- Come on.

104
00:17:06.151 --> 00:17:08.612
Number Three was completely
off the grid and the Mogs got him.

105
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:10.196
Didn't save him.

106
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:13.825
Come on.
I'm gonna be safer if I blend in.

107
00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:15.368
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

108
00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.579
Look. Even if I let you,
and I'm not,

109
00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.873
you can't just waltz into school
and start class...

110
00:17:19.998 --> 00:17:22.542
Do you think you're the only one
who can forge documents?

111
00:17:25.295 --> 00:17:26.255
Do you have a...

112
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.924
Five days of rations,
spare clothes, GPS, cash.

113
00:17:30.592 --> 00:17:31.844
- What's your name?
- John Smith.

114
00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:33.220
- Where are you from?
- Toronto.

115
00:17:33.345 --> 00:17:35.305
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

116
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.850
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

117
00:17:37.975 --> 00:17:39.434
I know the drill, OK?

118
00:17:43.939 --> 00:17:45.566
You keep this on you.
I'll call you every hour.

119
00:17:45.691 --> 00:17:47.317
If you don't pick up,
I know something's wrong.

120
00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:50.320
- Come on, every hour?
- That, or you can home school.

121
00:17:50.445 --> 00:17:52.406
And I'll be your teacher.

122
00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:54.908
Fine.

123
00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:58.871
Hey, John, don't be stupid.
You keep your head down.

124
00:17:58.996 --> 00:17:59.997
I know how to blend in.

125
00:18:23.103 --> 00:18:24.521
OK, doll. Take a seat.

126
00:18:24.646 --> 00:18:27.399
I'll just print up your schedule.
Back in a jiffy.

127
00:18:30.861 --> 00:18:32.404
I know she's the star photographer,

128
00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.323
but it's not fair
for the other students.

129
00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:36.033
She's using up
all the vital supplies.

130
00:18:36.158 --> 00:18:39.036
Emory, come on.
"Strangers in Paradise."

131
00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:40.037
At least she's creative.

132
00:18:40.162 --> 00:18:42.497
The pictures on her website
are totally inappropriate.

133
00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:46.043
Mr Behrman, if you want to keep
the photos, you should just say so.

134
00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:48.504
Keep the photos? They're already
all over the Internet!

135
00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:52.049
It's a violation to post things
like this without people's permission.

136
00:18:52.174 --> 00:18:53.383
You have to do something about this.

137
00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:55.844
Mr Behrman, excuse us
for a few minutes, OK?

138
00:19:03.435 --> 00:19:06.104
Sarah, this is not like you.

139
00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:09.233
Is there something going on?

140
00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:12.277
- Everything's fine.
- Sarah?

141
00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:15.364
- Honestly.
- Have a seat.

142
00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:19.409
You can't let a few negative students
get you down.

143
00:19:19.535 --> 00:19:23.247
Look, I don't want you to isolate
yourself from the rest of the school.

144
00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:28.335
- You should enjoy this year.
- OK, I'll try.

145
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.505
- Good.
- Can I please have my camera back?

146
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.217
No more photos on your website
without teacher and student permission.

147
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:36.969
OK.

148
00:19:37.094 --> 00:19:38.720
Here's your schedule.

149
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:45.978
Homeroom is calculus.
That's B-wing, room seven...

150
00:19:46.103 --> 00:19:47.646
Oh, Sarah!

151
00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:50.816
Could you show our friend
to his locker?

152
00:19:50.941 --> 00:19:52.484
He's from Santa Fe.

153
00:19:53.694 --> 00:19:56.405
Everybody, job fair starts tomorrow.

154
00:19:57.865 --> 00:20:00.367
What kind of camera do you use?

155
00:20:00.492 --> 00:20:02.786
Eavesdropping?
That's not gonna win you friends.

156
00:20:02.911 --> 00:20:04.454
- Check it out.
- What?

157
00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:09.293
Tell that to the principal
with a fish tank for an office.

158
00:20:09.418 --> 00:20:11.879
It's kind of hard not to hear.

159
00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:17.384
Sorry. This whole place
is kind of a fish tank.

160
00:20:18.635 --> 00:20:20.846
Well...
Room seven is down the hall,

161
00:20:20.971 --> 00:20:23.724
and that's your locker right there.

162
00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.102
Good luck...

163
00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:30.439
Oh, John...

164
00:20:30.564 --> 00:20:32.357
...Smith.

165
00:20:34.443 --> 00:20:37.654
OK. You don't want
to tell me your name.

166
00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:38.739
That's fine.

167
00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:49.082
That's really my name.
John Smith.

168
00:20:51.335 --> 00:20:52.711
Come on, check it out.

169
00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:54.254
Oh, OK.

170
00:20:58.383 --> 00:21:00.802
What's up, man? You new?

171
00:21:02.513 --> 00:21:04.306
Mark James.

172
00:21:05.307 --> 00:21:06.767
This is Kevin, Jackson,
Tyler and Max.

173
00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:08.602
- Hey, man, what's up?
- John.

174
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.562
Good to meet you, John.
Where are you from?

175
00:21:10.687 --> 00:21:13.732
- Santa Fe.
- New Mexico.

176
00:21:13.857 --> 00:21:14.942
Play any ball out there?

177
00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:17.152
- Football?
- Yeah.

178
00:21:17.694 --> 00:21:20.197
- No.
- Play anything?

179
00:21:20.322 --> 00:21:22.407
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

180
00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:23.575
Nope.

181
00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:28.455
OK. No, that's cool, man.
That's totally cool.

182
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.541
We could always use more
boosters in the stands, right?

183
00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:35.045
Listen. You need anything,
you ask us, OK?

184
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.006
- We got you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

185
00:21:38.882 --> 00:21:40.509
Good talking to you, big guy.

186
00:21:43.262 --> 00:21:44.513
Look who it is.

187
00:21:44.638 --> 00:21:46.807
Watch out, man.

188
00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:48.517
Sorry, Sam.

189
00:21:51.103 --> 00:21:52.771
Loser!

190
00:21:55.023 --> 00:21:56.149
Wait up, fool.

191
00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:57.484
Thanks.

192
00:21:59.319 --> 00:22:00.779
Gotta love the classics.

193
00:22:00.904 --> 00:22:03.699
Homecoming king versus
the science nerd.

194
00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:07.744
Just get better with time,
don't they?

195
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.290
- That guy, Mark, he's...
- Soon to be irrelevant.

196
00:22:11.415 --> 00:22:13.834
He's in the third year of
the best four years of his life.

197
00:23:16.522 --> 00:23:18.273
So, she was like,

198
00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:20.567
"The solar system's sun does
not revolve around the Earth."

199
00:23:20.692 --> 00:23:22.569
I said, "Yeah, right."

200
00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:26.865
Hey, Spock!

201
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:29.701
- Nailed it!
- Heads up! UFO, brother!

202
00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:32.079
That had to hurt.

203
00:23:32.204 --> 00:23:34.039
Hey, stay down, man.
Just stay down.

204
00:23:34.164 --> 00:23:37.042
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.
Oh, Mommy's coming!

205
00:23:40.045 --> 00:23:42.256
- Right in the face.
- Hey, you OK?

206
00:23:42.381 --> 00:23:46.218
- Assholes.
- Yo, new dude! Little help?

207
00:23:56.144 --> 00:23:57.980
Jesus!

208
00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.107
I'm fine! Get off me.

209
00:24:00.232 --> 00:24:01.733
Come on, man!

210
00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:04.278
- You OK?
- No.

211
00:24:08.824 --> 00:24:10.450
That's quite an arm you got there.

212
00:24:10.576 --> 00:24:13.328
Yeah. Who knew?

213
00:24:15.414 --> 00:24:17.708
So... what's with the UFO thing?

214
00:24:19.543 --> 00:24:20.794
I know it's your first day and all,

215
00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:23.547
but sooner or later
you'll figure it out.

216
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:25.674
Figure what out?

217
00:24:26.884 --> 00:24:29.595
I'm definitely not the guy
you want to hang with.

218
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:26.568
Invisible.

219
00:25:27.277 --> 00:25:29.154
You heard me
when I said that, right?

220
00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:33.242
Yeah. Yeah, because
I remember you being there.

221
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:22.207
Let us face, without panic,
the reality of our times.

222
00:26:22.332 --> 00:26:26.920
The fact that atom bombs may someday
be dropped on our cities.

223
00:26:27.045 --> 00:26:28.380
And let us prepare for survival

224
00:26:28.505 --> 00:26:30.465
by understanding the weapon
that threatens us.

225
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:31.550
Yeah.

226
00:26:39.474 --> 00:26:41.268
How you settling in, bro?

227
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:45.564
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. That's good.

228
00:26:45.689 --> 00:26:47.399
I see you and Spock are vibing.

229
00:26:49.109 --> 00:26:51.153
Got a bit of a soft spot for freaks,
do you?

230
00:26:51.278 --> 00:26:53.030
Who's talking?

231
00:26:54.865 --> 00:26:56.450
Yikes.

232
00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.830
Look. It's cute, it really is.
You are an adorable young man.

233
00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:06.293
But I find it irritating,
so keep it on the bleachers, OK?

234
00:27:06.418 --> 00:27:08.462
- All right.
- Good. That's good.

235
00:27:08.587 --> 00:27:11.715
Also, while I'm here, I'm gonna
let you in on a little tip.

236
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:31.151
Find your place fast.
Catch the rest of this flick, OK?

237
00:27:31.276 --> 00:27:33.320
Jesus, dude.
You are soaking wet.

238
00:27:34.404 --> 00:27:35.364
Oh, my God.

239
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.936
John, get up.
Come on. We gotta go. John.

240
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:08.522
- John.
- My hands. What...

241
00:28:08.647 --> 00:28:10.858
- Henri. My hands burn!
- John...

242
00:28:10.983 --> 00:28:12.860
- Look at me and relax.
- What's happening to me?

243
00:28:12.985 --> 00:28:14.486
They called them legacies back home.

244
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:17.197
You, the nine, you're
the only ones who have them.

245
00:28:17.322 --> 00:28:18.574
- Legacies?
- That's right.

246
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:20.659
Your parents were members
of the Lorien Garde.

247
00:28:20.784 --> 00:28:23.203
You've inherited their abilities.
Gifts.

248
00:28:23.328 --> 00:28:24.496
- Gifts?
- That's right.

249
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:27.165
My hands light up like road flares,
and you call that a gift?

250
00:28:27.291 --> 00:28:28.876
Each legacy has its own function.

251
00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:30.961
There's...
There's more coming?

252
00:28:31.086 --> 00:28:34.131
As you breathe and focus,

253
00:28:34.256 --> 00:28:35.674
you're gonna learn to control them.

254
00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:37.259
OK. OK.

255
00:28:37.384 --> 00:28:39.595
Just like you're doing,
right now.

256
00:28:40.888 --> 00:28:42.389
OK?

257
00:28:43.265 --> 00:28:44.349
How do your hands feel?

258
00:28:47.811 --> 00:28:49.521
- Better.
- Good.

259
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.900
So, what now?

260
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.110
Now?

261
00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:58.322
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

262
00:28:58.447 --> 00:29:00.032
I need you to be careful.

263
00:29:00.157 --> 00:29:03.368
Right now, you have to focus your mind.
Get some control.

264
00:29:03.493 --> 00:29:05.412
When you can do that,
you can get back to school.

265
00:29:05.537 --> 00:29:08.081
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

266
00:29:08.207 --> 00:29:10.209
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

267
00:29:10.334 --> 00:29:12.336
You keep yourself in check,
you understand?

268
00:29:12.461 --> 00:29:14.963
So I got all these powers,
but I'm not allowed to use them?

269
00:29:15.088 --> 00:29:16.215
Exactly.

270
00:31:16.418 --> 00:31:18.545
A little early for Thanksgiving.

271
00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:22.257
Paper or plastic?

272
00:32:08.637 --> 00:32:09.680
And you wind it here...

273
00:32:29.575 --> 00:32:31.243
"Strangers in Paradise"?

274
00:32:33.871 --> 00:32:36.415
I know. Arty, pretentious.

275
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.458
That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

276
00:32:38.584 --> 00:32:42.004
I just needed a name for my website
and it was right there.

277
00:32:44.298 --> 00:32:48.051
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

278
00:32:48.177 --> 00:32:51.138
Ironic, Ohio?
Has a ring to it.

279
00:32:53.891 --> 00:32:57.686
What's up with you?
You look different, or something.

280
00:32:57.811 --> 00:32:59.730
Sarah, come over!
I got a new bike!

281
00:32:59.855 --> 00:33:01.940
OK, I will next week.

282
00:33:02.065 --> 00:33:04.318
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

283
00:33:04.443 --> 00:33:06.445
Oh, they're so cute.

284
00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.614
You know... I mean it.

285
00:33:08.739 --> 00:33:10.240
Your photographs...

286
00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:12.784
My parents make me
baby-sit for film money,

287
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:16.997
and those are two of my victims.

288
00:33:17.122 --> 00:33:19.458
You know, I'm...

289
00:33:19.583 --> 00:33:22.920
I'm actually trying to
pay you a compliment, but...

290
00:33:23.045 --> 00:33:24.379
...it's not going so well.

291
00:33:27.758 --> 00:33:28.926
Right.

292
00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:33.305
Thank you.

293
00:33:35.307 --> 00:33:38.644
I don't know, I just...
see better through this thing.

294
00:33:41.104 --> 00:33:43.899
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

295
00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:47.152
Come on! Let's go!

296
00:33:49.446 --> 00:33:51.448
Excuse me.
Did you forget something?

297
00:33:51.573 --> 00:33:54.076
You had two things to do.
Lock the door and turn off the lights!

298
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:56.537
- That's Sam's dad?
- His stepdad.

299
00:33:56.662 --> 00:34:00.332
Every night
it's the same thing with you!

300
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:06.421
This is it.

301
00:34:15.097 --> 00:34:16.264
You live here?

302
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.935
Yeah, I grew up here.

303
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.193
- It's just a house.
- I know.

304
00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:34.867
You hungry?

305
00:34:34.992 --> 00:34:38.328
So, John, just moved from Santa Fe
a few weeks ago.

306
00:34:38.453 --> 00:34:39.913
- The Smiths, right?
- Yes, sir.

307
00:34:40.038 --> 00:34:43.041
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

308
00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:45.793
Everybody really does
know everything in this town.

309
00:34:45.918 --> 00:34:48.380
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

310
00:34:48.505 --> 00:34:52.050
- Question game!
- Sorry, my bad.

311
00:34:52.176 --> 00:34:54.178
- All right, everybody, surrender them.
- Here you go.

312
00:34:54.303 --> 00:34:57.723
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

313
00:34:57.848 --> 00:34:58.807
Hand them over.

314
00:34:58.932 --> 00:35:00.601
- And you.
- Mom?

315
00:35:00.726 --> 00:35:03.645
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

316
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.273
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

317
00:35:06.398 --> 00:35:10.694
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip, right?
You bored silly here?

318
00:35:10.819 --> 00:35:13.363
Nah, not with the spring carnival
coming up!

319
00:35:13.488 --> 00:35:16.325
It's fun, and you and your folks
should definitely come.

320
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.660
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

321
00:35:19.745 --> 00:35:20.746
Where's your mom?

322
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:22.372
- My...
- Mom.

323
00:35:22.497 --> 00:35:23.874
No, it's fine.

324
00:35:23.999 --> 00:35:26.919
My dad and mom,
they didn't get married.

325
00:35:27.044 --> 00:35:29.880
You know, check it out. Carnival.

326
00:35:30.005 --> 00:35:32.799
Sarah will be there
taking pictures for the paper.

327
00:35:32.925 --> 00:35:35.135
- Cheap labour.
- That is not why.

328
00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.845
She's a very talented photographer.

329
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:37.971
Question game!

330
00:35:38.096 --> 00:35:41.099
OK. Keep your voice down,
and we will play.

331
00:35:41.225 --> 00:35:42.935
It's a dinner tradition.

332
00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.853
Otherwise, we'd never talk
about the good stuff.

333
00:35:44.978 --> 00:35:46.271
Worst advice you ever got?

334
00:35:47.356 --> 00:35:48.565
"Pull this."

335
00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.858
Oh, stop!

336
00:35:49.983 --> 00:35:52.778
That's really gross. OK...

337
00:35:52.903 --> 00:35:55.072
"Your parents will
never know you're gone."

338
00:35:55.197 --> 00:35:57.533
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

339
00:35:57.658 --> 00:35:58.700
- Stop.
- Oh, my God.

340
00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:00.702
- What?
- OK, Sarah, your turn.

341
00:36:01.912 --> 00:36:05.541
Mom telling me that self-tanner
looks totally natural.

342
00:36:06.834 --> 00:36:09.127
- She was orange.
- Like a traffic cone.

343
00:36:09.253 --> 00:36:10.295
On picture day.

344
00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:11.797
Oh, you should go get that picture.

345
00:36:11.922 --> 00:36:13.173
- We still have the picture!
- John, you are gonna...

346
00:36:13.298 --> 00:36:14.967
Why would you want
to show him that?

347
00:36:15.092 --> 00:36:16.760
I shouldn't have said it.

348
00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:19.513
I think I tore them up.

349
00:36:25.435 --> 00:36:27.229
Sorry about that.

350
00:36:28.647 --> 00:36:29.940
About what?

351
00:36:31.275 --> 00:36:32.442
My parents.

352
00:36:32.568 --> 00:36:35.946
They were putting on
the "aren't we cool?" show.

353
00:36:36.071 --> 00:36:37.656
They seem very proud of you.

354
00:36:37.781 --> 00:36:39.658
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

355
00:36:39.783 --> 00:36:42.035
to go to the local
community college in Dayton.

356
00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:45.163
They'd love it if I stayed here.

357
00:36:45.289 --> 00:36:48.333
Got into wedding photography.

358
00:36:48.458 --> 00:36:50.335
What do you want to do?

359
00:36:55.549 --> 00:36:57.301
That's my favourite.

360
00:36:57.426 --> 00:36:58.886
It's got all these light leaks

361
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:02.014
so the photos come out
so interesting.

362
00:37:03.223 --> 00:37:04.892
Here, I'll show you.

363
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.945
See that one right there?

364
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.906
That's what I was talking about.

365
00:37:20.657 --> 00:37:22.117
What's this?

366
00:37:26.997 --> 00:37:32.127
That is kind of private, actually.

367
00:37:34.129 --> 00:37:35.797
It's amazing.

368
00:37:41.553 --> 00:37:43.972
- What?
- You...

369
00:37:45.182 --> 00:37:47.726
You're allowed to look
at everyone else,

370
00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:52.189
take our pictures, but...
we're not allowed to see you?

371
00:37:58.779 --> 00:38:00.906
OK. That's enough.

372
00:38:04.076 --> 00:38:05.869
Seems like you want to run away.

373
00:38:05.994 --> 00:38:07.955
I'll just be happy
when I can get out of here.

374
00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.748
I don't know.
I've been to a lot of places.

375
00:38:09.873 --> 00:38:12.292
You don't have to give me the
"there's no place like home" speech.

376
00:38:12.417 --> 00:38:13.919
I've heard it.

377
00:38:14.044 --> 00:38:15.337
No, no.

378
00:38:15.462 --> 00:38:17.589
You can go wherever you want,
see whatever you want to.

379
00:38:17.714 --> 00:38:22.010
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

380
00:38:24.972 --> 00:38:26.682
I...

381
00:38:32.437 --> 00:38:35.691
I think this is a pretty good place.

382
00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:52.207
Bernie, you dumb dog.

383
00:38:54.501 --> 00:38:57.462
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

384
00:38:57.588 --> 00:38:59.006
Well, hey.

385
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.633
Hold on a sec.

386
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.727
Your turn.

387
00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:17.316
Thanks.

388
00:39:32.581 --> 00:39:34.041
I'm fine.

389
00:39:34.166 --> 00:39:36.543
Heard you made quite
an impression in class yesterday.

390
00:39:36.668 --> 00:39:39.213
Flashlight.
It was a dumb prank.

391
00:39:39.338 --> 00:39:40.964
- But that class...
- Boring as hell?

392
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:42.966
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

393
00:39:43.091 --> 00:39:46.595
Look, I know it's none of my business,
but you need to stay off the grid.

394
00:39:47.429 --> 00:39:49.014
- What do you mean?
- It's all over the school.

395
00:39:49.139 --> 00:39:51.433
Mark James and his man-tards
have it out for you.

396
00:39:51.558 --> 00:39:53.519
Sarah may act like one of us...

397
00:39:53.644 --> 00:39:54.728
...she's one of them.

398
00:39:54.853 --> 00:39:56.021
He's into Sarah?

399
00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:59.024
More than that.
Nobody can go near her.

400
00:39:59.149 --> 00:40:00.776
They were like the town...

401
00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.613
Loser!

402
00:40:06.823 --> 00:40:08.408
Oh, God.

403
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:12.746
- Sucks to be you, bro!
- Seriously.

404
00:40:12.871 --> 00:40:16.124
Want a napkin?
Get a cleanup crew!

405
00:40:17.709 --> 00:40:19.962
I wonder who did that?

406
00:40:22.422 --> 00:40:23.382
What a loser.

407
00:40:23.507 --> 00:40:24.967
Leave me alone!

408
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.186
Did you have a nice time
last night, John?

409
00:40:37.646 --> 00:40:40.148
You see, in football,

410
00:40:40.274 --> 00:40:42.067
a quarterback needs a few things.

411
00:40:42.192 --> 00:40:43.610
Speed, strength...

412
00:40:43.735 --> 00:40:47.364
Mostly, though,
you need intuition.

413
00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:49.783
A feeling when things
are going south.

414
00:40:51.952 --> 00:40:54.830
First time we talked,
I should've listened to mine.

415
00:41:06.717 --> 00:41:08.385
There you go, John.

416
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.220
Good boy.

417
00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:14.391
Maybe you got some intuition
working for you, too.

418
00:41:18.187 --> 00:41:19.438
- That was awesome.
- You saw it, right?

419
00:41:25.444 --> 00:41:27.279
Raided lost and found.

420
00:41:27.404 --> 00:41:30.032
- Nobody loses anything cool.
- You gotta be kidding me.

421
00:41:30.157 --> 00:41:32.492
Dude, it was that or
the Hannah Montana sweatshirt.

422
00:41:32.618 --> 00:41:34.369
You got off easy.

423
00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:36.288
So...

424
00:41:37.706 --> 00:41:41.043
- Who's in the picture?
- My dad.

425
00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:42.669
The real one.

426
00:41:54.264 --> 00:41:55.265
Where was that taken?

427
00:41:56.934 --> 00:42:00.145
Mexico. The Yucatán.

428
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.233
We used to go every year looking for
evidence of ancient astronauts.

429
00:42:04.942 --> 00:42:06.443
Ancient astronauts?

430
00:42:06.568 --> 00:42:09.446
Yeah. UFOs and shit.

431
00:42:09.571 --> 00:42:11.573
Freak show stuff.

432
00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:14.284
He called himself an anthropologist.

433
00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:16.912
He was really just a foreman
at the steel mill.

434
00:42:19.748 --> 00:42:23.043
He spent all his time preparing
for some kind of alien arrival.

435
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.466
I used to think he was a genius.
Had to, I guess.

436
00:42:29.633 --> 00:42:32.386
Nobody wants to admit
their dad's a freak.

437
00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:48.068
Sam.

438
00:42:48.902 --> 00:42:50.195
Sam.

439
00:44:43.267 --> 00:44:45.727
Malcolm, what were you up to here?

440
00:46:05.015 --> 00:46:07.309
Jimmy, Vince,
come on, slow down, boys!

441
00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:32.709
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey!

442
00:46:46.306 --> 00:46:49.309
Mark James decided to fire
a warning shot about you.

443
00:46:52.437 --> 00:46:56.650
When you first meet somebody,
do you dump all your stuff on them?

444
00:46:56.775 --> 00:46:58.944
All your mistakes, your secrets?

445
00:47:00.112 --> 00:47:02.489
Look, Mark and I,

446
00:47:02.614 --> 00:47:04.616
we changed.

447
00:47:04.741 --> 00:47:06.577
I got into photography,

448
00:47:06.702 --> 00:47:10.914
and he wanted me to be
his own personal cheerleader.

449
00:47:11.039 --> 00:47:14.501
Said I was becoming a total snob.

450
00:47:14.626 --> 00:47:17.963
And when we broke up,
that's what he told everybody.

451
00:47:18.088 --> 00:47:22.050
That I was a total bitch.
And everyone listened.

452
00:47:23.552 --> 00:47:26.138
All my... "friends".

453
00:47:30.642 --> 00:47:31.602
I'm sorry.

454
00:47:31.727 --> 00:47:34.813
I'm not. I mean, I was...

455
00:47:35.856 --> 00:47:38.025
But... I don't know,

456
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.153
I kinda look at it like a total gift.

457
00:47:41.278 --> 00:47:43.071
Got away from all of that.

458
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:46.825
So...

459
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:48.911
...what's the hottest attraction
at this place?

460
00:47:55.792 --> 00:47:58.378
You gotta be kidding me, right?
This...

461
00:47:58.504 --> 00:47:59.963
Don't be scared.

462
00:48:20.734 --> 00:48:21.985
Save yourself.

463
00:48:42.256 --> 00:48:45.008
Last year,
she was drawn and quartered...

464
00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:46.760
It was awesome.

465
00:48:52.015 --> 00:48:53.308
My God.

466
00:49:04.236 --> 00:49:05.863
Hell's Gate.

467
00:49:06.572 --> 00:49:08.407
Everybody off.

468
00:49:30.888 --> 00:49:31.930
Quite a production.

469
00:49:32.055 --> 00:49:33.182
Small town.

470
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.283
OK. The last part got to me.

471
00:49:53.577 --> 00:49:54.578
What is that?

472
00:49:56.663 --> 00:49:58.624
Don't! Let him go!

473
00:49:58.749 --> 00:49:59.750
Stop it!

474
00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:04.963
Hello?

475
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.842
Was that real?
Are you all right?

476
00:50:10.844 --> 00:50:13.931
Let me go! Stop it!
Leave him alone!

477
00:50:36.912 --> 00:50:38.789
- No!
- Calm down.

478
00:50:38.914 --> 00:50:42.334
- Oh, my God. Just get off me!
- Sarah, come here!

479
00:50:42.459 --> 00:50:44.503
- Idiot! It's you!
- Calm down! Calm down!

480
00:50:44.628 --> 00:50:47.714
- Let go of me.
- You can take off, OK?

481
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.341
- Let go of me!
- Hey, listen. I will!

482
00:50:50.008 --> 00:50:51.218
Sarah!

483
00:51:05.065 --> 00:51:06.942
Where is she?

484
00:51:07.067 --> 00:51:08.694
It burns, man!

485
00:51:08.819 --> 00:51:10.863
Dude, let go of me!
It hurts!

486
00:51:12.114 --> 00:51:14.950
She's at Shepherd Falls!
Dude, put me down. What is that?

487
00:51:20.289 --> 00:51:23.542
- Where's John?
- I don't get what happened to us.

488
00:51:23.667 --> 00:51:25.669
- I don't. I really don't.
- So, you have your friend

489
00:51:25.794 --> 00:51:28.714
throw me over his shoulder, drag me
through the woods to come here,

490
00:51:28.839 --> 00:51:32.801
when all you had to do is ask me,
like a normal person!

491
00:51:32.926 --> 00:51:36.597
You don't have to tell me
I'm being an asshole, OK?

492
00:51:36.722 --> 00:51:39.892
But you're a problem for me, Sarah.

493
00:51:40.809 --> 00:51:42.895
Yeah, well, you really
should get over that.

494
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:46.190
- Wait. Sarah, wait.
- Just stop it!

495
00:51:47.274 --> 00:51:48.817
You OK?

496
00:52:01.205 --> 00:52:03.540
I hope you can throw
with your left hand.

497
00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:07.836
No, John, stop! Stop!

498
00:52:19.014 --> 00:52:21.225
John. John, stop. Wait.

499
00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.311
Hey. I just didn't want
you to break his arm.

500
00:52:24.436 --> 00:52:26.772
It's not you, it's me.
I shouldn't have lost it like that.

501
00:52:26.897 --> 00:52:28.148
Hey.

502
00:52:30.984 --> 00:52:32.736
Will you walk me home?

503
00:52:41.787 --> 00:52:43.956
Should really get that looked at.

504
00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:46.792
I will.

505
00:52:48.168 --> 00:52:49.670
I...

506
00:52:55.425 --> 00:52:56.718
I think we should talk.

507
00:53:00.389 --> 00:53:03.308
I know. It's crazy.

508
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.936
Mark is insane.

509
00:53:06.061 --> 00:53:08.897
And this is our last year.

510
00:53:09.022 --> 00:53:10.941
Who knows where you'll be
in three months?

511
00:53:12.234 --> 00:53:13.610
Exactly.

512
00:53:14.611 --> 00:53:16.071
Who knows?

513
00:53:17.489 --> 00:53:21.034
So, I guess I'll just...

514
00:53:21.159 --> 00:53:22.953
...see you when I see you?

515
00:53:24.288 --> 00:53:25.455
Yeah.

516
00:53:28.125 --> 00:53:29.418
OK.

517
00:53:36.341 --> 00:53:38.385
Your hand's really warm.

518
00:53:55.027 --> 00:53:56.904
All I think about is you.

519
00:53:57.029 --> 00:53:59.615
All I think about is you, too.

520
00:54:23.597 --> 00:54:25.307
Where did you come from?

521
00:54:27.893 --> 00:54:30.229
All right, Mom! I got it!

522
00:54:38.695 --> 00:54:40.948
- I...
- Yeah, I should go.

523
00:54:50.249 --> 00:54:51.208
Bye.

524
00:55:50.225 --> 00:55:53.270
John! In here.

525
00:55:56.481 --> 00:55:57.858
So, what are you?

526
00:55:59.985 --> 00:56:03.572
You threw those football players around
like it was nothing.

527
00:56:03.697 --> 00:56:07.492
And the hand thing?
That's not human.

528
00:56:07.618 --> 00:56:10.871
So, I'm asking you.
What are you?

529
00:56:13.582 --> 00:56:15.083
Do I need to threaten you?

530
00:56:15.209 --> 00:56:17.211
All right, 'cause I got
some pictures on my phone,

531
00:56:17.336 --> 00:56:18.962
and they're gonna start
some major questions.

532
00:56:19.087 --> 00:56:20.964
- Gimme that.
- No.

533
00:56:21.089 --> 00:56:23.342
You know I can hurt you.

534
00:56:39.942 --> 00:56:42.110
Knock yourself out.

535
00:56:49.326 --> 00:56:52.287
My entire childhood...

536
00:56:53.455 --> 00:56:55.958
...has been an episode of                 X-Files.

537
00:56:58.085 --> 00:57:00.337
You know what it's like
to feel something...

538
00:57:01.672 --> 00:57:04.383
...so strong...

539
00:57:04.508 --> 00:57:06.343
...that every day you have
to keep telling yourself

540
00:57:06.468 --> 00:57:09.513
your dad's gonna come back
and take you away from this shithole.

541
00:57:09.638 --> 00:57:12.266
And that everything
we believed in was true.

542
00:57:12.391 --> 00:57:14.810
And that we were not crazy.

543
00:57:19.273 --> 00:57:20.232
Please.

544
00:57:25.696 --> 00:57:27.155
Please.

545
00:57:30.826 --> 00:57:32.077
Your dad was right.

546
00:57:33.912 --> 00:57:35.080
What?

547
00:57:41.295 --> 00:57:42.796
He was right.

548
00:57:45.215 --> 00:57:47.342
About ancient astronauts...

549
00:57:48.385 --> 00:57:50.888
...life on other planets...

550
00:57:53.265 --> 00:57:54.516
...all of it.

551
00:57:58.937 --> 00:58:02.399
Yes! I knew... I knew he
wouldn't just leave us!

552
00:58:02.524 --> 00:58:05.068
I mean, they found his truck
near the border of Mexico,

553
00:58:05.194 --> 00:58:06.403
and he was just gone.

554
00:58:06.528 --> 00:58:08.280
- Maybe they took him.
- Sam...

555
00:58:08.405 --> 00:58:10.657
If he knew you were here,
he'd come home.

556
00:58:10.782 --> 00:58:14.036
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, I... I... I wouldn't.

557
00:58:14.161 --> 00:58:16.288
No, no, no. You gotta promise me.
Nobody knows this.

558
00:58:16.413 --> 00:58:20.542
There are others from where
I'm from looking for me.

559
00:58:21.418 --> 00:58:22.878
I'm not safe.

560
00:58:23.003 --> 00:58:27.883
Sam! I know you are in there.
Get your ass in the house, now!

561
00:58:28.759 --> 00:58:30.385
Wait until I get inside and then go.

562
00:58:30.511 --> 00:58:31.887
Sam?

563
00:58:34.264 --> 00:58:35.390
I promise.

564
00:58:37.726 --> 00:58:39.645
Yes!

565
00:58:43.815 --> 00:58:45.275
Come on.

566
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:01.667
Hey, you maniac.

567
00:59:01.792 --> 00:59:05.087
- Hello, son.
- Hey, what's with the...?

568
00:59:09.633 --> 00:59:10.551
Hello, Dad.

569
00:59:10.676 --> 00:59:12.678
Sheriff James says some boys
got hurt last night.

570
00:59:12.803 --> 00:59:14.805
Couple of them
spent the night in the hospital.

571
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:16.348
- You said it was four?
- Yeah, four.

572
00:59:16.473 --> 00:59:19.434
- On the football team.
- Yeah, that's right.

573
00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.938
Of course, none of them are talking.
That includes my own boy, Mark.

574
00:59:25.607 --> 00:59:29.653
- Your son is Mark?
- Yeah, that's right.

575
00:59:29.778 --> 00:59:31.780
You know, that was his
throwing arm that got hurt.

576
00:59:32.739 --> 00:59:34.616
He said you were there.

577
00:59:36.118 --> 00:59:38.537
No. I was actually with a girl.

578
00:59:38.662 --> 00:59:41.039
So, I wasn't paying any attention.

579
00:59:42.791 --> 00:59:43.750
Sarah Hart?

580
00:59:47.504 --> 00:59:52.009
Well, no one wants to be the first one
to say what really happened.

581
00:59:52.134 --> 00:59:55.554
But, eventually, someone will.

582
00:59:55.679 --> 00:59:58.307
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you, Sheriff.

583
00:59:58.432 --> 01:00:00.726
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

584
01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:23.874
- Four of them, huh?
- Yeah.

585
01:00:25.292 --> 01:00:27.002
Was it difficult?

586
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.922
Piece of cake.

587
01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:32.591
Good. Means you're getting it.

588
01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:36.178
- Go upstairs, pack your stuff.
- Because of last night?

589
01:00:36.303 --> 01:00:38.680
Because I don't like people
showing up asking questions.

590
01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:40.724
And I think this is gonna raise a few.

591
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:43.810
"They walk among us." What is this,
some more "truth is out there" freaks?

592
01:00:43.936 --> 01:00:46.772
Except that's actually you.

593
01:00:46.897 --> 01:00:49.024
One of the kids must
have caught you on video.

594
01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:50.484
Oh, shit.

595
01:00:50.609 --> 01:00:53.946
- He's some kind of freak!
- I can't get through the firewall.

596
01:00:54.071 --> 01:00:55.697
We have to go there
and take it down ourselves.

597
01:00:55.822 --> 01:00:57.991
Mogs see this,
just a matter of time.

598
01:00:58.116 --> 01:01:00.285
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

599
01:01:01.787 --> 01:01:03.497
I'm not going.

600
01:01:04.915 --> 01:01:06.667
I'm sorry, what did you say?

601
01:01:07.835 --> 01:01:09.419
I'm not going.

602
01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:12.714
OK. If you want to pick
the next place, that's fine...

603
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.466
It's not my fight and it never was!

604
01:01:14.591 --> 01:01:16.802
I can't even remember a world
before this one.

605
01:01:16.927 --> 01:01:20.013
Wait, wait.
Is this because of a girl?

606
01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:24.893
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

607
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:29.314
- You're not my father.
- No, no, no. He's dead.

608
01:01:29.439 --> 01:01:32.192
He died for you.
In fact, you know what?

609
01:01:32.317 --> 01:01:36.154
You have no idea how many others
have made sacrifices so you could live!

610
01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.739
And it wasn't so
you could come here

611
01:01:37.865 --> 01:01:39.950
and experience puppy love
like a real live boy!

612
01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.702
I'm not leaving.

613
01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:47.374
John. John!

614
01:01:47.499 --> 01:01:48.709
I'm not leaving!

615
01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:53.547
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

616
01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:00.971
Hey, John!

617
01:02:12.024 --> 01:02:14.401
I'm letting go, OK?

618
01:02:15.611 --> 01:02:17.279
- OK?
- OK.

619
01:02:28.332 --> 01:02:29.583
On our planet...

620
01:02:29.708 --> 01:02:31.376
Just tell me
why they want to kill me.

621
01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:35.923
The Mogs, they don't colonise.
They decimate. And then they move on.

622
01:02:36.048 --> 01:02:38.675
And now, they've moved here.

623
01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:40.969
There are few forces
that can stop them.

624
01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:43.639
You and the other five can.

625
01:02:43.764 --> 01:02:45.474
You were saved
for a bigger purpose.

626
01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:49.061
I'm not gonna let you
throw that away for a girl.

627
01:02:49.186 --> 01:02:51.563
She's not just a girl.

628
01:02:54.191 --> 01:02:56.818
I think about leaving her...

629
01:02:56.944 --> 01:02:58.862
...but I can't.

630
01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:01.323
And I don't know why.

631
01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:09.206
We don't love like the humans.
With us, it's forever.

632
01:03:13.377 --> 01:03:15.170
You never forget.

633
01:03:17.714 --> 01:03:22.094
If she is that for you,
then don't let them win.

634
01:03:22.219 --> 01:03:24.513
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

635
01:03:27.683 --> 01:03:29.017
Now, we have to go.

636
01:03:30.018 --> 01:03:32.604
I'll take care of the website tonight.
Buy you a day.

637
01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:36.525
A day? To say goodbye?

638
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.819
That's more than the rest of us had.

639
01:03:57.379 --> 01:03:59.214
He's some kind of freak!

640
01:04:09.892 --> 01:04:12.102
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

641
01:04:16.523 --> 01:04:17.482
Henri?

642
01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:41.548
Henri? Hello? Henri?

643
01:04:41.673 --> 01:04:46.261
No, but come here and
I'll tell you how to find him.

644
01:04:46.386 --> 01:04:48.096
Who are you? Where's Henri?

645
01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:51.058
417 Willard Court,
Warsaw, Indiana.

646
01:05:01.944 --> 01:05:04.154
Come on, come on.

647
01:05:04.279 --> 01:05:05.739
I need your help.

648
01:05:10.536 --> 01:05:12.746
So, you guys... you guys don't...

649
01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:15.123
- Abduct people?
- Yeah.

650
01:05:15.249 --> 01:05:16.208
No.

651
01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:19.711
But the other guys,
the ones that are chasing you...

652
01:05:19.837 --> 01:05:20.963
...they do?

653
01:05:42.401 --> 01:05:43.819
That's it.

654
01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:47.030
Thanks.

655
01:05:56.582 --> 01:05:58.500
- You brought a gun?
- I stole it from Ed.

656
01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:00.335
It might come in handy.
Let's go.

657
01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:03.797
- No.
- Dude, I came here to help you.

658
01:06:03.922 --> 01:06:07.384
You have. Now, go home.

659
01:06:30.115 --> 01:06:32.117
- What are you doing?
- I'm not bailing.

660
01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:33.911
What if these Mog people
took my dad?

661
01:07:07.945 --> 01:07:09.655
Holy shit!

662
01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:12.616
But you just dead-bolted it.

663
01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:16.828
- OK. New plan.
- Yeah.

664
01:07:16.954 --> 01:07:19.998
You follow that guy and you
text me if he comes back, OK?

665
01:07:20.123 --> 01:07:21.875
Copy that. I'm on it.

666
01:08:56.178 --> 01:08:57.136
Henri.

667
01:09:11.652 --> 01:09:13.362
- Are you OK?
- You're not supposed to be here.

668
01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:15.572
- What happened?
- The Mogs set this up.

669
01:09:15.697 --> 01:09:17.741
We need to leave.
They're coming.

670
01:09:18.575 --> 01:09:21.453
Everybody stays right where they are
or I'll shoot this kid.

671
01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:24.081
I'll do it! Get your hands up!

672
01:09:24.206 --> 01:09:25.415
So glad you brought the gun.

673
01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:28.126
You're Malcolm's boy.

674
01:09:29.545 --> 01:09:32.714
- Get the lights, will you?
- Shut up! Get your hands up!

675
01:09:44.852 --> 01:09:48.313
You! You're the one
from the video on our site.

676
01:09:48.438 --> 01:09:51.567
- The one they're after.
- The one who's after?

677
01:09:51.692 --> 01:09:54.278
- What's he talking about?
- The Mogs, they've been here.

678
01:09:54.403 --> 01:09:55.654
- This was a trap.
- Yeah.

679
01:09:55.779 --> 01:09:59.157
These dudes, whatever they are, man,
they got plans, know what I'm sayin'?

680
01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:01.660
- John...
- I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.

681
01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:04.454
Nobody gives a crap what I say.
But this is real, man!

682
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:05.914
John. It's time to leave.

683
01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:08.000
They like it here, Earth.

684
01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.668
They're gonna take
all this shit, everything!

685
01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:11.128
John! Now!

686
01:10:11.253 --> 01:10:13.130
We either do what they say
or we are all gonna die.

687
01:10:13.255 --> 01:10:14.381
It's time to go! Now!

688
01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.776
John. John! John, no!

689
01:11:09.228 --> 01:11:11.021
John, go!

690
01:11:11.146 --> 01:11:12.523
- Now!
- Go!

691
01:11:38.757 --> 01:11:41.218
Start the car.
Come on! Get us out of here!

692
01:11:41.343 --> 01:11:42.970
- I can't find the keys!
- What do you mean?

693
01:11:43.095 --> 01:11:46.348
- I can't find the keys!
- Come on! Come on!

694
01:11:47.307 --> 01:11:48.600
Guys, what are we waiting for?

695
01:11:50.519 --> 01:11:52.354
- I've lost the keys.
- John, start the engine.

696
01:11:52.479 --> 01:11:55.524
- What?
- You can do it. Start the car.

697
01:11:58.402 --> 01:12:00.529
- Come on.
- Start the car.

698
01:12:07.369 --> 01:12:09.496
Come on, come on!
He's coming! He's coming!

699
01:12:09.621 --> 01:12:12.291
Start the car! Start the car!
Use your magic powers!

700
01:12:12.416 --> 01:12:13.876
Come on! We are so dead!

701
01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:18.547
Oh, my God!

702
01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.178
Go! Drive the car!

703
01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:37.482
You take this.

704
01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:45.365
Malcolm was using it
to track the others.

705
01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:47.242
Wait, wait, wait.
So, my dad was...

706
01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:48.577
He was helping us.

707
01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:50.829
He was supposed to bring us together.

708
01:12:52.289 --> 01:12:53.957
You need to find the others.

709
01:12:54.958 --> 01:12:56.418
Together you'll be more powerful.

710
01:13:09.014 --> 01:13:10.849
I can't do this without you.

711
01:13:13.018 --> 01:13:14.228
Yes, you can.

712
01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:17.606
Yes, you can.

713
01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:23.695
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

714
01:13:29.993 --> 01:13:30.953
Henri.

715
01:14:27.009 --> 01:14:28.343
Just let me talk.

716
01:14:30.095 --> 01:14:32.681
OK. So, I called you
like you said.

717
01:14:34.683 --> 01:14:36.977
I mean, it's not my fault they got...

718
01:14:38.812 --> 01:14:40.731
I mean, we held up our end.

719
01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:43.275
We're still in?

720
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.695
The whole new world order thing?

721
01:14:48.822 --> 01:14:50.699
The Locator.

722
01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:53.410
- Where is it?
- OK.

723
01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:57.623
All he had was a knife
and that rock.

724
01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:00.000
And I put it...

725
01:15:02.127 --> 01:15:03.879
It was over there, man.

726
01:15:04.004 --> 01:15:06.548
"It was over there, man."

727
01:15:06.673 --> 01:15:08.675
But it's not there now.

728
01:15:30.989 --> 01:15:33.367
Cartoons for children.

729
01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:37.788
Where I'm from,
men have to work.

730
01:15:37.913 --> 01:15:39.706
Look, I'll work hard.

731
01:15:39.831 --> 01:15:43.418
The disregard that so many of you
have for practical matters,

732
01:15:43.544 --> 01:15:46.588
it's... beautiful.

733
01:15:48.173 --> 01:15:50.259
I think we should
all have some fun. Huh?

734
01:15:52.261 --> 01:15:55.264
Gadgets.
You call them "toys for boys."

735
01:15:56.932 --> 01:15:59.852
I have a gadget.
Would you like to play with it?

736
01:15:59.977 --> 01:16:02.479
No, no. I...

737
01:16:03.605 --> 01:16:05.440
It wants to play with you!

738
01:16:20.664 --> 01:16:21.832
Need to talk to you.

739
01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:23.876
Any idea where
I might find your friend?

740
01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:26.545
He's not who you think he is.

741
01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:28.422
Excuse me?

742
01:16:33.969 --> 01:16:37.264
The Paradise Sheriff's Department
raided the home of two suspects,

743
01:16:37.389 --> 01:16:40.058
seizing computers
and several suspicious items.

744
01:16:40.184 --> 01:16:44.021
An APB has been issued on
the suspects and anyone with...

745
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.400
We need to get out of here.

746
01:16:50.235 --> 01:16:51.820
There's a news thing.

747
01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:55.407
The cops think you and Henri
are criminals or terrorists.

748
01:17:05.876 --> 01:17:07.419
We're going back.

749
01:17:10.714 --> 01:17:12.591
I'm outside of the home
here in Warsaw

750
01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:15.802
where the mutilated bodies of
two paranormal website operators

751
01:17:15.928 --> 01:17:17.971
were just found a few hours ago.

752
01:17:18.096 --> 01:17:19.723
The police are not saying
if they have any leads

753
01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:22.142
or even why these
brutal murders occurred.

754
01:17:22.267 --> 01:17:24.520
Police have no suspects
at this time.

755
01:17:35.322 --> 01:17:36.740
- I have one of those!
- What?

756
01:17:36.865 --> 01:17:39.535
One of those.
I took it from my dad's stash.

757
01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.787
- I need you to get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

758
01:17:41.912 --> 01:17:45.374
Let me off at Linndale.
Sarah's at a house up there.

759
01:17:45.499 --> 01:17:48.335
- I'll call you after.
- And then what?

760
01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.712
Then I get the rock
and you go home.

761
01:18:00.848 --> 01:18:03.141
- It's him.
- John?

762
01:18:03.642 --> 01:18:06.895
- Did you see that?
- What's he doing here?

763
01:18:08.564 --> 01:18:09.606
Yeah, he's here.

764
01:18:14.444 --> 01:18:15.529
That's him!

765
01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:33.547
Come on.

766
01:18:35.132 --> 01:18:36.216
Come on.

767
01:18:59.198 --> 01:19:01.742
Doesn't seem like
your kind of crowd.

768
01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.706
Not so sure who my
kind of crowd is right now.

769
01:19:07.831 --> 01:19:10.334
- Look, just...
- John Smith?

770
01:19:10.459 --> 01:19:12.294
I'm such an idiot.

771
01:19:13.754 --> 01:19:16.924
And they're saying that your dad
is some kind of terrorist.

772
01:19:17.049 --> 01:19:19.134
He's not a terrorist.

773
01:19:19.801 --> 01:19:21.136
Tell me the truth.

774
01:19:22.179 --> 01:19:24.306
Who are you?

775
01:19:34.858 --> 01:19:36.026
He's upstairs.

776
01:19:36.944 --> 01:19:38.654
All right, guys, out of the way.

777
01:19:40.697 --> 01:19:42.866
You didn't answer my question.

778
01:19:43.825 --> 01:19:45.369
I just came to say goodbye.

779
01:19:45.494 --> 01:19:46.995
- John, wait! What are you...
- Don't move!

780
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.164
- No, John!
- Sarah!

781
01:19:59.091 --> 01:20:00.050
How...

782
01:20:00.175 --> 01:20:01.552
- Move! Move!
- Go!

783
01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:18.902
That was awesome!

784
01:20:28.078 --> 01:20:29.913
What you did is not possible.

785
01:20:30.038 --> 01:20:31.540
Who I am...

786
01:20:31.665 --> 01:20:33.542
...it's all in here.
I took these for you.

787
01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:37.337
Wait. Come with me. Please.

788
01:20:38.338 --> 01:20:40.632
Any idea where they'd be?

789
01:20:40.757 --> 01:20:43.177
I think I know
where she might go.

790
01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:56.607
- Who the hell are they?
- Big-ass linebackers?

791
01:21:04.990 --> 01:21:06.825
Holy shit...

792
01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:12.414
No, no, no!

793
01:21:15.667 --> 01:21:16.710
Dad!

794
01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:33.018
An alcohol-fuelled
young guy like you...

795
01:21:33.852 --> 01:21:37.189
...healthy and well-fed.

796
01:21:37.314 --> 01:21:39.358
I bet you watch a lot of television,
don't you?

797
01:21:39.483 --> 01:21:41.151
Do you? Do you?

798
01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:42.903
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

799
01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:45.447
In this situation here,
you're probably thinking,

800
01:21:45.572 --> 01:21:48.700
"Maybe I could save the day.
Maybe I could be the hero."

801
01:21:48.825 --> 01:21:52.996
But I say... don't do that.

802
01:21:53.121 --> 01:21:54.748
OK?

803
01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:59.336
Tell me now,
where is the boy?

804
01:22:27.322 --> 01:22:29.199
These are beautiful.

805
01:22:44.464 --> 01:22:45.924
Can you show me?

806
01:23:13.827 --> 01:23:16.121
- No!
- Get in!

807
01:23:21.251 --> 01:23:24.046
Let me go! Let me go!

808
01:23:29.468 --> 01:23:30.761
Let go of me!

809
01:23:37.476 --> 01:23:39.311
- Hello?
- Where are you?

810
01:23:39.436 --> 01:23:40.562
I'm at the high school.

811
01:23:40.687 --> 01:23:42.231
Yeah, you need to
get out of there now.

812
01:23:42.356 --> 01:23:43.315
Why? What's happening?

813
01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:46.151
Your stunt with the car
is already on YouTube.

814
01:23:46.276 --> 01:23:49.112
If they're not right on your
ass now, they will be soon.

815
01:23:49.947 --> 01:23:51.323
Come on.

816
01:23:51.448 --> 01:23:53.534
And don't tell me
this is not my fight.

817
01:23:53.659 --> 01:23:57.746
My dad probably knew those guys were
coming and that's why they took him.

818
01:23:58.747 --> 01:24:01.625
And also, I have your dog.

819
01:24:02.584 --> 01:24:03.669
Look, I'm on my way.

820
01:24:03.794 --> 01:24:05.212
I'll meet you out front
of the school.

821
01:24:05.337 --> 01:24:07.089
You've got to get out now.

822
01:24:07.798 --> 01:24:09.299
John?

823
01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:10.425
John!

824
01:24:15.138 --> 01:24:16.390
Let's go.

825
01:24:20.978 --> 01:24:22.729
Let go of me!

826
01:24:27.234 --> 01:24:28.944
Jesus!

827
01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:33.574
Sarah! If you're in there, run!

828
01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.326
Run!

829
01:24:39.955 --> 01:24:41.498
Let me go!

830
01:24:48.755 --> 01:24:51.592
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let them hurt you, OK?

831
01:24:51.717 --> 01:24:54.303
Do you understand me?
Come on.

832
01:26:08.168 --> 01:26:11.088
It'd be a good idea, cowboy, if you
kept your heroics off the Internet.

833
01:26:13.423 --> 01:26:14.341
Who are you?

834
01:26:14.466 --> 01:26:17.970
Number Six.
Where's your protector?

835
01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:19.680
Dead.

836
01:26:19.805 --> 01:26:22.599
Yeah. Mine, too.
Mogs got her four months ago.

837
01:26:22.724 --> 01:26:25.227
- We've been tracking them down.
- Tracking them?

838
01:26:25.352 --> 01:26:27.521
Yeah. Lucky for you,
I saved your ass.

839
01:26:27.646 --> 01:26:29.815
You should be watching
your own ass.

840
01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:32.150
Mogs have all the exits covered.

841
01:26:32.276 --> 01:26:35.279
Looks like you're gonna
have to fight to get out.

842
01:26:35.404 --> 01:26:37.489
- Are you game?
- Yeah.

843
01:26:37.614 --> 01:26:39.950
There's a tunnel under the school
that leads to the stadium.

844
01:26:40.075 --> 01:26:42.744
Oh, you made friends.
How nice.

845
01:26:44.913 --> 01:26:46.123
Let's go.

846
01:26:47.457 --> 01:26:50.002
Got any other legacies
I should know about?

847
01:26:50.127 --> 01:26:51.628
Stay tuned.

848
01:27:24.786 --> 01:27:26.288
Oh, shit.

849
01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:35.130
Oh, shit!

850
01:27:44.973 --> 01:27:46.725
Careful, they'll see us.

851
01:27:48.101 --> 01:27:50.562
And you're gonna need
all your energy.

852
01:27:54.107 --> 01:27:57.027
- What was that?
- They're comin'.

853
01:28:00.948 --> 01:28:02.074
Sam, what are you doing?

854
01:28:02.199 --> 01:28:03.492
Did you see what just
flew out of that truck?

855
01:28:03.617 --> 01:28:05.744
And your dog just shape-shifted
into one of them.

856
01:28:05.869 --> 01:28:08.956
I thought he was gonna eat me.
Here's your rock.

857
01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:14.962
Hi! I'm Sam.
What's your name?

858
01:28:16.046 --> 01:28:17.172
Jane Doe.

859
01:28:17.297 --> 01:28:18.507
That's cool. It's cool.

860
01:28:18.632 --> 01:28:19.925
So, are you a number, too?

861
01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:22.970
- Who is this tool?
- Sam, focus.

862
01:28:23.095 --> 01:28:24.513
What flew out of the truck?

863
01:28:30.227 --> 01:28:32.271
Come on! Go, go!

864
01:28:32.396 --> 01:28:34.273
Sam. Come on! Go!

865
01:28:39.945 --> 01:28:41.655
Come on! Come on!

866
01:28:44.825 --> 01:28:46.076
Come on!

867
01:29:55.938 --> 01:29:58.190
- Hit me.
- What?

868
01:29:58.315 --> 01:30:00.651
With your lumen.
I need to power up.

869
01:30:02.945 --> 01:30:04.238
Hit me!

870
01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:17.042
Red Bull's for pussies.

871
01:30:19.503 --> 01:30:22.130
He killed Henri.
I want him.

872
01:30:58.166 --> 01:30:59.501
Four!

873
01:31:11.763 --> 01:31:13.807
You're good with your hands.

874
01:31:13.932 --> 01:31:15.851
- Thanks.
- No problem.

875
01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:21.648
- My dog, he... He just...
- Yeah, he's a chimera.

876
01:31:21.773 --> 01:31:23.859
He came with you from Lorien.

877
01:31:23.984 --> 01:31:26.320
Someone had to look after you.

878
01:32:29.466 --> 01:32:31.510
You brought a gun?
Are you serious?

879
01:32:31.635 --> 01:32:33.929
- What? It might come in handy.
- This way.

880
01:32:45.148 --> 01:32:46.441
Go!

881
01:32:54.783 --> 01:32:56.326
- Take her back to the tunnel!
- Come on!

882
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:05.002
Holy...!

883
01:33:10.591 --> 01:33:11.800
I play a lot of Xbox.

884
01:34:51.483 --> 01:34:56.321
Number Four, I think you
have something I need.

885
01:34:57.364 --> 01:35:01.660
Oh, thank you for making this
so nice and easy.

886
01:35:01.785 --> 01:35:05.205
Think of how quickly we'll
finish off the rest of the planet.

887
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:07.791
It's fantastic!

888
01:35:07.916 --> 01:35:10.335
Soon, I'll be done with all of you.

889
01:35:11.128 --> 01:35:12.629
Just relax.

890
01:35:14.006 --> 01:35:17.801
You can't stop what's coming.
You never could.

891
01:35:17.926 --> 01:35:19.928
You have...

892
01:35:20.053 --> 01:35:21.430
...no idea...

893
01:35:23.682 --> 01:35:25.100
...what I'm capable of.

894
01:36:39.633 --> 01:36:40.759
John.

895
01:36:44.096 --> 01:36:45.889
Fireproof?

896
01:36:46.974 --> 01:36:49.142
I told you to stay tuned.

897
01:37:18.255 --> 01:37:20.299
All right, give me that.
Come on.

898
01:37:21.258 --> 01:37:22.384
Thank you.

899
01:37:54.541 --> 01:37:57.419
Well, that was disappointing.
So, not a tracking device?

900
01:37:57.544 --> 01:37:59.546
No, it was.

901
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:02.216
- Did you feel that, too?
- Yeah.

902
01:38:02.341 --> 01:38:05.260
- We know where we need to go.
- Yeah, we can find the others.

903
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.185
Here.

904
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:15.604
Thank you.

905
01:38:15.729 --> 01:38:17.606
I hope this doesn't get you in trouble.

906
01:38:17.731 --> 01:38:19.358
Nah.

907
01:38:19.483 --> 01:38:22.069
Stuff goes missing
from evidence all the time.

908
01:38:22.194 --> 01:38:24.530
My dad won't even know.

909
01:38:24.655 --> 01:38:27.449
- You want to be heading west now.
- Why?

910
01:38:27.574 --> 01:38:30.494
Because I told my dad
you're going east.

911
01:38:37.876 --> 01:38:40.504
Six, Sam's coming with us.

912
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:42.381
What?

913
01:38:42.506 --> 01:38:43.423
No way.

914
01:38:43.549 --> 01:38:46.969
He's one of us now.
We need to find his father.

915
01:38:50.639 --> 01:38:53.976
You slow us down,
I'll shoot you myself.

916
01:38:54.101 --> 01:38:56.478
And I believe you.
Can we go now?

917
01:39:02.526 --> 01:39:04.778
You know, I wouldn't leave
if it wasn't...

918
01:39:04.903 --> 01:39:07.447
- Safer.
- Yeah.

919
01:39:07.573 --> 01:39:09.074
I know.

920
01:39:10.367 --> 01:39:12.744
Really sorry about
what happened with Henri.

921
01:39:14.079 --> 01:39:15.789
Me, too.

922
01:39:19.209 --> 01:39:21.670
You know I'll find you again.

923
01:39:24.047 --> 01:39:26.967
Probably still be here.

924
01:39:28.218 --> 01:39:30.429
It's the people
that make the place.

925
01:39:30.554 --> 01:39:32.848
- Right?
- Yeah.

926
01:39:39.271 --> 01:39:43.066
Henri warned me that
we only fall for one person.

927
01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.737
Ever?

928
01:39:47.654 --> 01:39:49.031
Ever.

929
01:41:21.874 --> 01:41:24.543
This is the first town
I've left without Henri.

930
01:41:25.711 --> 01:41:29.089
But it's also the first one
I have a reason to come back to.

931
01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:34.469
Henri was right,
we're stronger together.

932
01:41:34.595 --> 01:41:37.139
So we will find the others.

933
01:41:39.433 --> 01:41:44.688
My planet is called Lorien,
but Earth is my home now.

934
01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:48.025
It's as good a place as any
in the universe.

935
01:41:48.859 --> 01:41:51.153
And that's how it's going to stay.
