WEBVTT

1
00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:32.503
Whoo.

2
00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.469
You know, showboating like that
just makes you look desperate.

3
00:05:03.505 --> 00:05:07.271
Yeah, "Look at me. I can
flip my ski." Pathetic.

4
00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.403
- Yeah.
- Daniel, that was awesome.

5
00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:13.710
Nicole.

6
00:05:17.485 --> 00:05:19.646
Hey, Daniel, Nicole left, huh?

7
00:05:19.688 --> 00:05:22.816
Should've let me talk to her.

8
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.495
Whoo-hoo.

9
00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:39.095
I love it out here.

10
00:05:42.644 --> 00:05:46.080
The Big Dipper. It's my favourite.

11
00:05:48.049 --> 00:05:49.744
- Do you know that one?
- No.

12
00:05:49.818 --> 00:05:52.548
I got a D in Astronomy.

13
00:05:56.658 --> 00:05:59.559
So, I never see you with anyone.

14
00:05:59.627 --> 00:06:03.028
Do you have a girlfriend
out of town or something?

15
00:06:10.004 --> 00:06:12.097
Daniel? Daniel?

16
00:06:18.847 --> 00:06:22.044
I want you to feel this.

17
00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:26.786
This is what's coming for you.

18
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:31.117
Daniel, are you ok?

19
00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:34.920
Oh, my God.

20
00:06:39.734 --> 00:06:42.931
He's a freak. He's
some kind of freak.

21
00:07:28.716 --> 00:07:29.944
Number Three's dead.

22
00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.953
You all right?

23
00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:37.822
- Yeah.
- Anyone else see what happened?

24
00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:22.368
I told you not to keep this
crap. It just slows us down.

25
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.959
All right, let's go.

26
00:08:58.473 --> 00:08:59.940
Daniel.

27
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.881
This is the part I hate
the most, the running.

28
00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:14.184
But it's the only thing
in my life that's real.

29
00:09:14.222 --> 00:09:16.053
The rest is a lie.

30
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.285
Even Henri.

31
00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:20.259
People think he's my father.

32
00:09:20.295 --> 00:09:21.922
He's not.

33
00:09:21.963 --> 00:09:26.525
He's a warrior from my planet,
assigned to keep me alive.

34
00:09:27.835 --> 00:09:30.065
I don't remember my father.

35
00:09:30.104 --> 00:09:33.267
All he left for me was
some kind of box.

36
00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:36.072
Henri says he'll pass it on
to me when the time is right.

37
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.874
I got my first scar when
I was nine years old,

38
00:09:41.916 --> 00:09:44.441
near the border of Mexico.

39
00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:47.283
It woke me from my sleep.

40
00:09:47.322 --> 00:09:49.024
It was the first sign that the

41
00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:51.349
Mogadorians had found
us here on Earth.

42
00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:55.128
The second scar
came when I was 12.

43
00:09:55.196 --> 00:09:58.495
I was in Colorado, in the
middle of a spelling bee.

44
00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:02.698
As soon as I felt it, I
knew Number Two was dead.

45
00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:06.702
Last night, I got my third scar.

46
00:10:09.444 --> 00:10:12.290
I was just a kid
when the Mogadorians

47
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.313
invaded my planet, Lorien.

48
00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:16.817
Nine of us children escaped.

49
00:10:16.884 --> 00:10:21.321
We were gifted, meant to protect
our people when we grew up.

50
00:10:21.356 --> 00:10:25.053
We never got the chance.
Everyone was killed.

51
00:10:26.294 --> 00:10:29.161
We are the last of our kind.

52
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.462
Three of us are gone. Dead.

53
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:36.732
They are hunting us down,
one by one, in order.

54
00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:40.336
I know I'm next.

55
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.509
I am Number Four.

56
00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:44.875
All right, well, so...

57
00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:47.847
Daniel won't be in school
the rest of the semester.

58
00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:50.383
Ok. You, too.

59
00:10:52.387 --> 00:10:53.752
Your new ID.

60
00:10:54.589 --> 00:10:56.899
And this time, you
stay out of sight,

61
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.026
huh? No school, no teams, nothing.

62
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.051
John Smith. Very original.

63
00:11:01.129 --> 00:11:04.292
I don't want to be original.
I want to be invisible.

64
00:11:08.136 --> 00:11:10.297
This time was different.

65
00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:12.329
I didn't just get a scar.

66
00:11:12.373 --> 00:11:14.967
I saw Number Three.

67
00:11:17.045 --> 00:11:20.708
I felt the knife, I felt him
die. I could tell we all did.

68
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:25.316
- The others.
- We should get moving.

69
00:11:25.353 --> 00:11:28.015
Mogadorians could've already
picked up our scent.

70
00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:33.123
We're going to Paradise. I
have business to take care of.

71
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:42.955
It's Bernie Kosar.

72
00:12:44.932 --> 00:12:46.399
Played football.

73
00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:54.268
- Yeah, he played for Cleveland.
- Good to know.

74
00:12:54.308 --> 00:12:56.381
Next time, I get
to pick the place.

75
00:12:56.382 --> 00:12:57.382
Yeah.

76
00:13:28.876 --> 00:13:31.538
That's all of it.
I'm going to bed.

77
00:13:31.612 --> 00:13:35.207
Ooh. Hang on. I
need a new picture.

78
00:13:36.517 --> 00:13:39.008
We have to wipe out anything
that hits the Internet.

79
00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:42.385
Say "Paradise."

80
00:13:48.462 --> 00:13:49.486
Oh, shit.

81
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.725
This is why I need
you to be invisible.

82
00:14:23.264 --> 00:14:24.288
Get back inside.

83
00:14:26.234 --> 00:14:27.599
John.

84
00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:31.195
Come on. Come back inside.

85
00:14:40.748 --> 00:14:43.911
Little small for a
Mogadorian, don't you think?

86
00:14:46.287 --> 00:14:48.118
I'm sure he belongs to someone.

87
00:14:48.189 --> 00:14:51.283
He doesn't have any
collar or tags.

88
00:14:51.359 --> 00:14:53.919
Somebody, somewhere,
must miss you, huh?

89
00:14:56.931 --> 00:14:58.330
Come on.

90
00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.095
Another pair of eyes and
ears watching the house?

91
00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:04.247
I'm gonna need
somebody to talk to.

92
00:15:04.248 --> 00:15:05.248
Talk to me.

93
00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:09.441
Yeah, keep the dog.

94
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.909
What are you gonna call him?

95
00:15:12.313 --> 00:15:15.248
How about Bernie Kosar?

96
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.209
What are you doing up?

97
00:16:54.281 --> 00:16:55.873
I changed my mind.

98
00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.781
About what?

99
00:16:57.852 --> 00:17:00.912
Look, as much fun as
you are to be around,

100
00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:04.015
I can't be a prisoner. I
have to go to school.

101
00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:06.083
- No. No way, too risky.
- Come on.

102
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.685
Number Three was completely off
the grid and the Mogs got him.

103
00:17:08.729 --> 00:17:10.253
- Didn't save him.
- Mm.mm.

104
00:17:10.331 --> 00:17:13.892
Come on. I'm gonna be
safer if I blend in.

105
00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:15.435
I promise I'll keep a low profile.

106
00:17:15.503 --> 00:17:17.664
Look. Even if I let
you, and I'm not,

107
00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:19.935
you can't just waltz into
school and start class...

108
00:17:20.007 --> 00:17:22.601
Do you think you're the only
one who can forge documents?

109
00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:26.346
Do you have a...?

110
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.008
Five days of rations,
spare clothes, GPS, cash.

111
00:17:30.451 --> 00:17:31.713
- What's your name?
- John Smith.

112
00:17:31.752 --> 00:17:33.276
- Where are you from?
- Toronto.

113
00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:35.254
You seem kind of tan for Toronto.

114
00:17:35.322 --> 00:17:39.486
Santa Fe, New Mexico.
I know the drill, ok?

115
00:17:43.931 --> 00:17:45.498
You keep this on you.
I'll call you every hour.

116
00:17:45.533 --> 00:17:47.125
If you don't pick up, I
know something's wrong.

117
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:50.398
- Come on, every hour?
- That, or you can home school.

118
00:17:50.438 --> 00:17:52.463
And I'll be your teacher.

119
00:17:53.607 --> 00:17:54.972
Fine.

120
00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:58.944
Hey, John, don't be stupid.
You keep your head down.

121
00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:00.389
I know how to blend in.

122
00:18:23.104 --> 00:18:24.469
Ok, doll. Take a seat.

123
00:18:24.505 --> 00:18:26.973
I'll just print up your
schedule. Back in a jiffy.

124
00:18:30.845 --> 00:18:32.472
I know she's the
star photographer,

125
00:18:32.513 --> 00:18:34.413
but it's not fair to
the other students.

126
00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:36.109
She's using up all
the vital supplies.

127
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:37.835
Emory, come on. "Strangers in

128
00:18:37.836 --> 00:18:39.984
Paradise." At least
she's creative.

129
00:18:40.054 --> 00:18:42.545
The pictures on her website
are totally inappropriate.

130
00:18:42.623 --> 00:18:44.472
Mr Behrman, if you
want to keep the

131
00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:46.115
photos, you should just say so.

132
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.560
Keep the photos? They're
already all over the Internet.

133
00:18:48.629 --> 00:18:50.384
It's a violation to
post things like

134
00:18:50.385 --> 00:18:51.996
this without people's permission.

135
00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:53.363
You have to do
something about this.

136
00:18:53.434 --> 00:18:55.868
Mr Behrman, excuse us
for a few minutes, ok?

137
00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:06.845
Sarah, this is not like you.

138
00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:09.315
Is there something going on?

139
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.251
- Everything's fine.
- Sarah?

140
00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:15.311
- Honestly.
- Have a seat.

141
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.489
You can't let a few negative
students get you down.

142
00:19:19.527 --> 00:19:21.269
Look, I don't want you to isolate

143
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.327
yourself from the
rest of the school.

144
00:19:23.364 --> 00:19:28.168
- You should enjoy this year.
- Ok, I'll try.

145
00:19:28.169 --> 00:19:29.243
Good.

146
00:19:29.244 --> 00:19:31.563
Can I please have my camera back?

147
00:19:31.639 --> 00:19:33.632
No more photos on
your website without

148
00:19:33.633 --> 00:19:35.268
teacher and student permission.

149
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:37.037
Ok.

150
00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:38.806
Here's your schedule.

151
00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:46.047
Homeroom is calculus. That's
B-wing, room seven...

152
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.084
Oh, Sarah. Could you
show our friend

153
00:19:49.085 --> 00:19:51.888
to his locker? He's from Santa Fe.

154
00:19:51.926 --> 00:19:54.565
Job fair starts
tomorrow. Everybody,

155
00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:56.420
job fair starts tomorrow.

156
00:19:56.497 --> 00:19:59.591
What kind of camera do you use?

157
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.867
Eavesdropping? That's not
gonna win you friends.

158
00:20:02.903 --> 00:20:04.530
- Check it out.
- What?

159
00:20:05.873 --> 00:20:08.706
Tell that to the principal with
a fish tank for an office.

160
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.935
It's kind of hard not to hear.

161
00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:17.445
Sorry. This whole place
is kind of a fish tank.

162
00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:20.910
Well... Room seven
is down the hall,

163
00:20:20.955 --> 00:20:23.583
and, that's your
locker right there.

164
00:20:25.526 --> 00:20:28.654
Good luck...

165
00:20:28.729 --> 00:20:30.526
Oh, John...

166
00:20:30.564 --> 00:20:32.657
Smith.

167
00:20:34.435 --> 00:20:37.734
Ok. You don't want to
tell me your name.

168
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:38.795
That's fine.

169
00:20:45.713 --> 00:20:49.149
That's really my name. John Smith.

170
00:20:58.392 --> 00:21:00.952
What's up, man? You new?

171
00:21:02.529 --> 00:21:06.829
Mark James. This is Kevin,
Jackson, Tyler and Max.

172
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.629
- Hey, man, what's up?
- John.

173
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:10.637
Good to meet you, John.
Where are you from?

174
00:21:10.671 --> 00:21:13.640
- Santa Fe.
- Oh, New Mexico.

175
00:21:13.674 --> 00:21:15.005
Play any ball out there?

176
00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:17.635
- Football?
- Yeah.

177
00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:20.272
- No.
- Play anything?

178
00:21:20.314 --> 00:21:22.475
Baseball? Soccer? Ping-pong?

179
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:24.983
Nope.

180
00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:28.614
Ok. No, that's cool, man.
That's totally cool.

181
00:21:28.656 --> 00:21:30.624
We could always use more
boosters in the stands, right?

182
00:21:30.658 --> 00:21:34.958
Listen. You need anything,
you ask us, ok?

183
00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:38.021
- We got you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

184
00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:42.592
Good talking to you, big guy.

185
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.635
Look who it is.

186
00:21:44.672 --> 00:21:46.867
Watch out, man.

187
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:48.532
Sorry, Sam.

188
00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:52.545
Loser.

189
00:21:55.015 --> 00:21:56.209
Wait up, fool.

190
00:21:56.283 --> 00:21:57.545
Thanks.

191
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.912
Gotta love the classics.

192
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:03.752
Homecoming king versus
the science nerd.

193
00:22:05.326 --> 00:22:07.817
Just get better with
time, don't they?

194
00:22:07.861 --> 00:22:11.353
- That guy, Mark, he's...
- Soon to be irrelevant.

195
00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:13.889
He's in the third year of the
best four years of his life.

196
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.525
So, she was like,
"The solar system's

197
00:23:18.526 --> 00:23:20.626
sun does not revolve
around the Earth."

198
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.635
I said, "Yeah, right."

199
00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:26.937
Hey, Spock.

200
00:23:27.007 --> 00:23:29.771
- Nailed it.
- Heads up. UFO, brother.

201
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.142
That had to hurt.

202
00:23:32.212 --> 00:23:33.941
Hey, stay down, man.
Just stay down.

203
00:23:34.014 --> 00:23:35.174
He's gonna cry. He's gonna cry.

204
00:23:35.249 --> 00:23:37.717
- Oh, Mommy's coming.
- Oh...

205
00:23:40.053 --> 00:23:42.317
- Right in the face.
- Hey, are you ok?

206
00:23:42.389 --> 00:23:46.291
- Assholes.
- Yo, new dude. Little help?

207
00:23:56.136 --> 00:23:58.070
Jesus.

208
00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.232
I'm fine. Get off me.

209
00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:02.070
Come on, man.

210
00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:04.100
- You ok?
- No.

211
00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:10.509
That's quite an arm you got there.

212
00:24:10.584 --> 00:24:13.417
Yeah. Who knew?

213
00:24:15.422 --> 00:24:17.788
So, what's with the UFO thing?

214
00:24:19.526 --> 00:24:20.891
I know it's your
first day and all,

215
00:24:20.961 --> 00:24:23.555
but, sooner or later
you'll figure it out.

216
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:25.757
Figure what out?

217
00:24:26.934 --> 00:24:29.368
I'm definitely not the guy
you want to hang with.

218
00:25:25.158 --> 00:25:27.217
Invisible.

219
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:29.229
You heard me when I
said that, right?

220
00:25:29.263 --> 00:25:33.359
Yeah. Yeah, because I
remember you being there.

221
00:26:18.378 --> 00:26:22.280
Let us face, without panic,
the reality of our times.

222
00:26:22.316 --> 00:26:24.216
The fact that atom bombs

223
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.609
may, some day, be
dropped on our cities.

224
00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.449
And let us prepare for survival

225
00:26:28.522 --> 00:26:30.547
by understanding the
weapon that threatens us.

226
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:31.615
Yeah.

227
00:26:37.864 --> 00:26:41.322
How you settling in, bro?

228
00:26:42.569 --> 00:26:45.629
- Fine, thanks.
- Good. That's good.

229
00:26:45.672 --> 00:26:49.039
I see you and Spock are vibing.

230
00:26:49.109 --> 00:26:51.043
Got a bit of a soft spot
for freaks, do you?

231
00:26:51.111 --> 00:26:52.840
Who's talking?

232
00:26:54.881 --> 00:26:57.850
Yikes.

233
00:26:57.918 --> 00:27:01.911
Look. It's cute, it really is.
You are an adorable young man.

234
00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:04.150
But I find it irritating,

235
00:27:04.224 --> 00:27:06.351
so keep it on the bleachers, ok?

236
00:27:06.426 --> 00:27:08.519
- All right.
- Good. That's good.

237
00:27:08.595 --> 00:27:10.256
Also, while I'm here,

238
00:27:10.297 --> 00:27:11.924
I'm gonna let you
in on a little tip.

239
00:27:27.481 --> 00:27:31.212
Find your place fast. Catch
the rest of this flick, ok?

240
00:27:31.284 --> 00:27:33.377
Jesus, dude. You are soaking wet.

241
00:28:02.849 --> 00:28:04.908
John, get up. Come
on. We gotta go.

242
00:28:04.985 --> 00:28:06.009
John.

243
00:28:06.053 --> 00:28:08.578
- John.
- My hands. What...?

244
00:28:08.655 --> 00:28:10.919
- Henri. My hands burn.
- John...

245
00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:12.925
- Look at me and relax.
- What's happening to me?

246
00:28:12.993 --> 00:28:14.551
They called them
legacies back home.

247
00:28:14.628 --> 00:28:17.256
You, the nine, you're the
only ones who have them.

248
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.661
- Legacies?
- That's right.

249
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:20.724
Your parents were members
of the Lorien Garde.

250
00:28:20.767 --> 00:28:23.258
You've inherited their
abilities. Gifts.

251
00:28:23.336 --> 00:28:24.462
- Gifts?
- That's right.

252
00:28:24.538 --> 00:28:26.335
My hands light up
like road flares.

253
00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:27.453
And you call that a gift?

254
00:28:27.454 --> 00:28:28.933
Each legacy has its own function.

255
00:28:29.009 --> 00:28:31.034
There's... There's more coming?

256
00:28:31.078 --> 00:28:35.742
As you breathe and focus, you're
gonna learn to control them.

257
00:28:35.758 --> 00:28:36.758
Ok. ok.

258
00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:39.684
Just like you're doing, right now.

259
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.052
Ok?

260
00:28:43.256 --> 00:28:44.416
How do your hands feel?

261
00:28:45.525 --> 00:28:49.586
- Better.
- Good.

262
00:28:51.431 --> 00:28:52.955
So, what now?

263
00:28:53.667 --> 00:28:55.157
Now?

264
00:28:55.235 --> 00:28:58.398
We wait. You're gonna keep
growing stronger and faster.

265
00:28:58.438 --> 00:29:00.167
I need you to be careful.

266
00:29:00.207 --> 00:29:03.301
Right now, you have to focus
your mind. Get some control.

267
00:29:03.376 --> 00:29:05.469
When you can do that, you
can get back to school.

268
00:29:05.545 --> 00:29:08.139
I don't want to raise suspicion.
I still have business here.

269
00:29:08.215 --> 00:29:10.046
In the meantime, your powers
will only draw attention.

270
00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:12.415
You keep yourself in
check, you understand?

271
00:29:12.452 --> 00:29:15.046
So I got all these powers, but
I'm not allowed to use them?

272
00:29:15.088 --> 00:29:16.282
Exactly.

273
00:31:16.409 --> 00:31:19.640
A little early for Thanksgiving.

274
00:31:20.747 --> 00:31:22.271
Paper or plastic?

275
00:31:42.502 --> 00:31:45.266
Whoa.

276
00:32:08.628 --> 00:32:09.754
And you wind it here...

277
00:32:29.582 --> 00:32:31.311
"Strangers in Paradise"?

278
00:32:33.887 --> 00:32:36.447
I know. Arty, pretentious.

279
00:32:36.489 --> 00:32:38.684
That's not actually
what I was gonna say.

280
00:32:38.758 --> 00:32:42.057
I just needed a name for my
website and it was right there.

281
00:32:44.297 --> 00:32:48.131
You know, they should've
called this town "Ironic."

282
00:32:48.168 --> 00:32:51.194
Ironic, Ohio? Has a ring to it.

283
00:32:53.907 --> 00:32:57.399
What's up with you? You look
different, or something.

284
00:32:57.477 --> 00:32:59.342
Sarah, come over.
I got a new bike.

285
00:32:59.379 --> 00:33:02.007
Ok, I will next week.

286
00:33:02.048 --> 00:33:04.380
- Hold this for a second.
- All right.

287
00:33:04.451 --> 00:33:06.510
Oh, they're so cute.

288
00:33:06.586 --> 00:33:08.679
You know, I mean it.

289
00:33:08.722 --> 00:33:10.314
Your photographs...

290
00:33:10.357 --> 00:33:12.848
My parents make me
babysit for film money,

291
00:33:12.926 --> 00:33:17.056
and those are two of my victims.

292
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.530
You know, I'm...

293
00:33:19.599 --> 00:33:23.000
I'm actually trying to pay
you a compliment, but...

294
00:33:23.036 --> 00:33:24.435
it's not going so well.

295
00:33:25.538 --> 00:33:27.062
Oh.

296
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:30.039
Right.

297
00:33:32.178 --> 00:33:33.372
Thank you.

298
00:33:35.315 --> 00:33:38.716
I don't know, I just, see
better through this thing.

299
00:33:41.087 --> 00:33:43.681
It's like my own
personal BS detector.

300
00:33:45.992 --> 00:33:47.220
Come on. Let's go.

301
00:33:49.295 --> 00:33:51.290
Excuse me. Did you
forget something?

302
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:53.231
You had two things
to do, you know?

303
00:33:53.299 --> 00:33:54.751
Lock the door and
turn off the lights.

304
00:33:54.752 --> 00:33:56.593
- That's Sam's dad?
- His stepdad.

305
00:33:56.669 --> 00:33:59.695
Every night it's the
same thing with you.

306
00:34:05.011 --> 00:34:06.478
This is it.

307
00:34:15.088 --> 00:34:16.350
You live here?

308
00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.024
Yeah, I grew up here.

309
00:34:24.464 --> 00:34:28.025
- It's just a house.
- I know.

310
00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:34.934
You hungry?

311
00:34:35.008 --> 00:34:38.307
So, John, just moved from
Santa Fe a few weeks ago.

312
00:34:38.378 --> 00:34:39.970
- The Smiths, right?
- Yes, sir.

313
00:34:40.046 --> 00:34:43.106
- And your father's a writer?
- Yes, he is.

314
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:45.845
Everybody really does know
everything in this town.

315
00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:48.444
Oh, gossip spreads like Ebola.

316
00:34:48.488 --> 00:34:49.785
Question game.

317
00:34:49.823 --> 00:34:52.121
Oh. Sorry, my bad.

318
00:34:52.158 --> 00:34:53.705
All right, everybody,
surrender them.

319
00:34:53.706 --> 00:34:54.706
Here you go.

320
00:34:54.707 --> 00:34:57.659
All electronic devices.
Come on, Sarah. Thank you.

321
00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:58.856
Hand them over.

322
00:34:58.932 --> 00:35:00.729
- And you.
- Mum?

323
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.735
He'll get it back after dinner.
You'll get it back after dinner.

324
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.330
- Thank you, John. See? It's fine.
- All right.

325
00:35:06.406 --> 00:35:10.740
So, Santa Fe's kind of hip,
right? You bored silly here?

326
00:35:10.777 --> 00:35:13.439
Nah, not with the spring
carnival coming up.

327
00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.415
It's fun, and you and your
folks should definitely come.

328
00:35:16.449 --> 00:35:18.747
Oh, it's just me and my dad.

329
00:35:19.786 --> 00:35:20.810
Where's your mum?

330
00:35:20.854 --> 00:35:22.446
- My...
- Mum.

331
00:35:22.489 --> 00:35:26.983
No, it's fine. My dad and
mum, they didn't get married.

332
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.961
You know, check it out. Carnival.

333
00:35:29.996 --> 00:35:32.362
Sarah will be there taking
pictures for the paper.

334
00:35:32.432 --> 00:35:33.524
Cheap labour.

335
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.192
- That is not why.
- No.

336
00:35:35.268 --> 00:35:37.178
She's a very talented
photographer.

337
00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:38.179
Question game.

338
00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.164
Ok. Keep your voice
down, and we will play.

339
00:35:41.207 --> 00:35:43.006
It's a dinner
tradition. Otherwise,

340
00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.904
we'd never talk about
the good stuff.

341
00:35:44.978 --> 00:35:46.343
Worst advice you ever got?

342
00:35:47.347 --> 00:35:48.644
"Pull this."

343
00:35:48.681 --> 00:35:49.909
Oh, stop.

344
00:35:49.983 --> 00:35:51.575
That's really gross.

345
00:35:51.651 --> 00:35:52.845
Ok...

346
00:35:52.886 --> 00:35:55.150
"Your parents will never
know you're gone."

347
00:35:55.188 --> 00:35:57.213
It worked with your folks.
That's how she got here.

348
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:58.780
- Stop it. Stop.
- Oh, my God.

349
00:35:58.825 --> 00:36:00.793
- What?
- Ok, Sarah, your turn.

350
00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.748
Oh. Mum telling me
that self-tanner

351
00:36:03.749 --> 00:36:05.593
looks totally natural.

352
00:36:05.665 --> 00:36:07.860
She was orange.

353
00:36:07.901 --> 00:36:10.369
Like a traffic cone.
On picture day.

354
00:36:10.436 --> 00:36:11.926
Oh, you should go
get that picture.

355
00:36:11.972 --> 00:36:13.739
- We still have the picture.
- John, you are gonna...

356
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.035
Why would you want
to show him that?

357
00:36:15.108 --> 00:36:17.372
I shouldn't have said it.

358
00:36:17.443 --> 00:36:19.536
I think I tore them up.

359
00:36:25.451 --> 00:36:27.282
Sorry about that.

360
00:36:28.488 --> 00:36:32.515
- About what?
- My parents.

361
00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:36.017
They were putting on the
"aren't we cool?" show.

362
00:36:36.062 --> 00:36:37.723
They seem very proud of you.

363
00:36:37.797 --> 00:36:39.731
Yeah, and they're already
trying to convince me

364
00:36:39.799 --> 00:36:42.097
to go to the local community
college in Dayton.

365
00:36:42.168 --> 00:36:45.228
They'd love it if I stayed here.

366
00:36:45.271 --> 00:36:48.399
Got into wedding photography.

367
00:36:48.474 --> 00:36:51.443
What do you want to do?

368
00:36:55.548 --> 00:36:57.379
That's my favourite.

369
00:36:57.417 --> 00:36:58.941
It's got all these light leaks

370
00:36:59.018 --> 00:37:02.078
so the photos come
out so interesting.

371
00:37:03.223 --> 00:37:04.952
Here, I'll show you.

372
00:37:14.867 --> 00:37:16.994
See that one right there?

373
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.970
That's what I was talking about.

374
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.335
What's this?

375
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:32.213
That is kind of private, actually.

376
00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.883
It's amazing.

377
00:37:41.561 --> 00:37:44.029
- What?
- You...

378
00:37:45.265 --> 00:37:47.790
You're allowed to look
at everyone else...

379
00:37:47.867 --> 00:37:52.133
take our pictures, but...
we're not allowed to see you?

380
00:37:58.778 --> 00:38:00.973
Ok. That's enough.

381
00:38:04.083 --> 00:38:05.948
Seems like you want to run away.

382
00:38:05.985 --> 00:38:08.010
I'll just be happy when
I can get out of here.

383
00:38:08.087 --> 00:38:09.816
I don't know. I've been
to a lot of places.

384
00:38:09.889 --> 00:38:10.957
You don't have to give me the

385
00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:12.357
"there's no place
like home" speech.

386
00:38:12.425 --> 00:38:13.983
I've heard it.

387
00:38:14.027 --> 00:38:17.656
No, no. You can go wherever you
want, see whatever you want to.

388
00:38:17.697 --> 00:38:22.066
But a place is only as good
as the people you know in it.

389
00:38:24.971 --> 00:38:26.734
I...

390
00:38:32.445 --> 00:38:35.744
I think this is a
pretty good place.

391
00:38:49.329 --> 00:38:52.298
Bernie, you dumb dog.

392
00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.060
- Does he belong to you?
- Yeah. I gotta go.

393
00:38:57.136 --> 00:39:00.765
Well, hey. Hold on a sec.

394
00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:11.783
Your turn.

395
00:39:16.055 --> 00:39:17.386
Thanks.

396
00:39:32.572 --> 00:39:34.096
I'm fine.

397
00:39:34.173 --> 00:39:36.607
Heard you made quite an
impression in class yesterday.

398
00:39:36.676 --> 00:39:39.941
Flash-light. It was a dumb
prank. But that class...

399
00:39:40.012 --> 00:39:43.038
- Boring as hell? Yeah.
- Yeah.

400
00:39:43.082 --> 00:39:45.277
Look, I know it's
none of my business,

401
00:39:45.278 --> 00:39:47.246
but you need to stay off the grid.

402
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.083
- What do you mean?
- It's all over the school.

403
00:39:49.122 --> 00:39:51.488
Mark James and his man-tards
have it out for you.

404
00:39:51.557 --> 00:39:53.582
Sarah may act like one of us...

405
00:39:53.659 --> 00:39:54.785
she's one of them.

406
00:39:54.861 --> 00:39:56.089
He's into Sarah?

407
00:39:56.129 --> 00:39:59.098
More than that. Nobody
can go near her.

408
00:39:59.132 --> 00:40:00.827
They were like the town...

409
00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.232
Whoa.

410
00:40:03.269 --> 00:40:04.634
Loser.

411
00:40:04.704 --> 00:40:08.572
No... ok, come on... Oh, God.

412
00:40:09.409 --> 00:40:11.604
- Sucks to be you, bro.
- Seriously.

413
00:40:11.677 --> 00:40:15.238
Want a napkin? Get
a clean-up crew.

414
00:40:17.717 --> 00:40:20.049
I wonder who did that?

415
00:40:22.021 --> 00:40:23.318
What a loser.

416
00:40:23.389 --> 00:40:25.050
Leave me alone.

417
00:40:27.827 --> 00:40:29.954
Ah, ah, ah...

418
00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:36.261
Did you have a nice
time last night, John?

419
00:40:37.637 --> 00:40:42.131
You see, in football, a
quarterback needs a few things.

420
00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:43.665
Speed, strength...

421
00:40:43.743 --> 00:40:47.440
Mostly, though, you
need intuition.

422
00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.846
A feeling when things
are going south.

423
00:40:51.951 --> 00:40:54.886
First time we talked, I
should've listened to mine.

424
00:41:04.197 --> 00:41:07.564
There you go, John.

425
00:41:08.935 --> 00:41:11.665
Good boy.

426
00:41:11.737 --> 00:41:14.467
Maybe you got some intuition
working for you, too.

427
00:41:18.177 --> 00:41:19.508
That was awesome.

428
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:27.316
Raided lost and found.

429
00:41:27.353 --> 00:41:30.117
- Nobody loses anything cool.
- You gotta be kidding me.

430
00:41:30.156 --> 00:41:32.030
Dude, it was that or the Hannah

431
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:34.388
Montana sweatshirt.
You got off easy.

432
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.452
So...

433
00:41:37.497 --> 00:41:41.126
- who's in the picture?
- My dad.

434
00:41:41.167 --> 00:41:43.465
The real one.

435
00:41:54.113 --> 00:41:55.341
Where was that taken?

436
00:41:56.883 --> 00:42:00.284
Mexico. The Yucatán.

437
00:42:00.319 --> 00:42:02.338
We used to go every
year looking for

438
00:42:02.339 --> 00:42:04.085
evidence of ancient astronauts.

439
00:42:04.924 --> 00:42:06.516
Ancient astronauts?

440
00:42:06.559 --> 00:42:09.528
Yeah. UFOs and shit.

441
00:42:09.562 --> 00:42:11.621
Freak show stuff.

442
00:42:11.697 --> 00:42:14.359
He called himself an
anthropologist...

443
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.960
He was really just a
foreman at the steel mill.

444
00:42:19.605 --> 00:42:23.097
He spent all his time preparing
for some kind of alien arrival.

445
00:42:24.911 --> 00:42:26.572
I used to think he was a genius.

446
00:42:26.612 --> 00:42:29.547
Had to, I guess.

447
00:42:29.582 --> 00:42:32.107
Nobody wants to admit
their dad's a freak.

448
00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:48.125
Sam...

449
00:42:48.901 --> 00:42:50.266
Sam.

450
00:42:54.173 --> 00:42:55.401
Oh.

451
00:44:43.282 --> 00:44:45.773
Malcolm, what were you up to here?

452
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.396
Jimmy, Vince, come
on, slow down, boys.

453
00:46:31.056 --> 00:46:32.785
- Hey, Sarah.
- Hey.

454
00:46:46.305 --> 00:46:49.365
Mark James decided to fire
a warning shot about you.

455
00:46:52.444 --> 00:46:56.710
When you first meet somebody, do
you dump all your stuff on them?

456
00:46:56.782 --> 00:46:59.012
All your mistakes, your secrets?

457
00:47:00.186 --> 00:47:04.680
Look, Mark and I, we changed.

458
00:47:04.757 --> 00:47:06.657
I got into photography,

459
00:47:06.692 --> 00:47:10.992
and he wanted me to be his
own personal cheerleader.

460
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:14.557
Said I was becoming a total snob.

461
00:47:14.633 --> 00:47:18.034
And when we broke up, that's
what he told everybody.

462
00:47:18.103 --> 00:47:22.130
That I was a total bitch.
And everyone listened.

463
00:47:23.542 --> 00:47:26.204
All my friends.

464
00:47:29.114 --> 00:47:31.674
I'm sorry.

465
00:47:31.717 --> 00:47:34.880
I'm not. I mean, I was...

466
00:47:35.855 --> 00:47:38.050
but, I don't know,

467
00:47:38.123 --> 00:47:41.217
I kinda look at it
like a total gift.

468
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.160
Got away from all of that.

469
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:48.933
So, what's the hottest
attraction at this place?

470
00:47:55.808 --> 00:47:58.436
You gotta be kidding
me, right? This...

471
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.102
Don't be scared.

472
00:48:20.733 --> 00:48:25.102
Save yourself.

473
00:48:42.254 --> 00:48:45.087
Last year, she was
drawn and quartered.

474
00:48:45.124 --> 00:48:47.615
It was awesome.

475
00:48:50.896 --> 00:48:53.626
My God.

476
00:49:04.243 --> 00:49:05.972
Hell's Gate.

477
00:49:06.545 --> 00:49:08.775
Everybody off.

478
00:49:30.035 --> 00:49:31.662
Quite a production.

479
00:49:31.704 --> 00:49:35.697
Small town.

480
00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:51.353
Ok. The last part got to me.

481
00:49:53.058 --> 00:49:55.083
What is that?

482
00:49:56.662 --> 00:49:58.687
Don't. Let him go. Let him go.

483
00:49:58.731 --> 00:50:01.029
Stop it.

484
00:50:03.402 --> 00:50:04.426
Hello?

485
00:50:06.605 --> 00:50:08.903
Was that real? Are you all right?

486
00:50:10.843 --> 00:50:12.868
Let me go. Stop it.

487
00:50:12.945 --> 00:50:14.776
Leave him alone.

488
00:50:36.902 --> 00:50:38.870
- No.
- Whoa. Calm down.

489
00:50:38.904 --> 00:50:41.896
- Oh, my God. Just get off me.
- Sarah, come here.

490
00:50:41.974 --> 00:50:44.568
- Idiot. It's you.
- Calm down. Calm down.

491
00:50:44.643 --> 00:50:46.907
- Let go of me.
- You can take off, ok?

492
00:50:46.979 --> 00:50:49.413
- Let go of me. Let go of me.
- Hey, listen. I will. I will.

493
00:50:50.015 --> 00:50:51.277
Sarah.

494
00:51:05.064 --> 00:51:07.032
Where is she?

495
00:51:07.066 --> 00:51:08.761
It burns, man.

496
00:51:08.801 --> 00:51:12.066
Dude, let go of me, bro, it hurts.

497
00:51:12.104 --> 00:51:15.039
She's at Shepherd Falls. Dude,
put me down. What is that?

498
00:51:20.279 --> 00:51:21.279
Where's John?

499
00:51:21.346 --> 00:51:24.474
I don't get what happened to
us. I don't. I really don't.

500
00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:26.814
So you have your friend
throw me over his shoulder,

501
00:51:26.885 --> 00:51:28.785
drag me through the
woods to come here,

502
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:32.848
when all you had to do is ask
me. Like a normal person.

503
00:51:32.925 --> 00:51:36.656
You don't have to tell me
I'm being an asshole, ok?

504
00:51:36.728 --> 00:51:39.959
But you're a problem
for me, Sarah.

505
00:51:40.032 --> 00:51:42.967
Yeah, well, you really
should get over that.

506
00:51:43.035 --> 00:51:46.471
- Wait. Sarah, wait.
- Just stop it.

507
00:51:47.272 --> 00:51:48.864
You ok?

508
00:52:01.186 --> 00:52:03.552
I hope you can throw
with your left hand.

509
00:52:03.622 --> 00:52:07.888
No, John, stop. Stop.

510
00:52:19.004 --> 00:52:21.302
John. John, stop. Wait.

511
00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:24.366
Hey. I just didn't want
you to break his arm.

512
00:52:24.443 --> 00:52:26.843
It's not you, it's me. I shouldn't
have lost it like that.

513
00:52:26.879 --> 00:52:28.574
Hey.

514
00:52:30.983 --> 00:52:32.814
Will you walk me home?

515
00:52:41.793 --> 00:52:44.023
You should really
get that looked at.

516
00:52:45.531 --> 00:52:46.862
I will.

517
00:52:48.167 --> 00:52:49.725
I...

518
00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.805
I think we should talk.

519
00:53:00.445 --> 00:53:03.380
I know. It's crazy.

520
00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:06.017
Mark is insane.

521
00:53:06.051 --> 00:53:08.952
And this is our last year.

522
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:11.012
Who knows where you'll
be in three months?

523
00:53:11.056 --> 00:53:13.684
Exactly.

524
00:53:14.593 --> 00:53:16.151
Who knows?

525
00:53:18.263 --> 00:53:21.096
So, I guess I'll just...

526
00:53:21.166 --> 00:53:23.031
see you when I see you?

527
00:53:24.269 --> 00:53:25.531
Yeah.

528
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.505
Ok.

529
00:53:36.348 --> 00:53:38.441
Your hand's really warm.

530
00:53:55.033 --> 00:53:56.967
All I think about is you.

531
00:53:57.035 --> 00:53:59.663
All I think about is you, too.

532
00:54:23.595 --> 00:54:25.358
Where did you come from?

533
00:54:27.899 --> 00:54:30.299
All right, Mum. I got it.

534
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.003
- I...
- Yeah, I should go.

535
00:54:50.622 --> 00:54:51.622
Bye.

536
00:55:50.215 --> 00:55:53.343
John. In here.

537
00:55:56.288 --> 00:55:57.915
So, what are you?

538
00:56:00.459 --> 00:56:03.656
You threw those football players
around like it was nothing.

539
00:56:03.695 --> 00:56:07.563
And the hand thing?
That's not human.

540
00:56:07.632 --> 00:56:10.931
So I'm asking you, what are you?

541
00:56:13.572 --> 00:56:15.130
Do I need to threaten you?

542
00:56:15.207 --> 00:56:17.573
All right, because I got
some pictures on my phone,

543
00:56:17.609 --> 00:56:19.109
and they're gonna start
some major questions.

544
00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.045
- Give me that.
- No.

545
00:56:21.079 --> 00:56:23.411
You know I can hurt you?

546
00:56:39.931 --> 00:56:42.161
Knock yourself out.

547
00:56:49.341 --> 00:56:52.367
My entire childhood...

548
00:56:53.445 --> 00:56:55.072
has been an episode of X-Files.

549
00:56:58.083 --> 00:57:00.574
You know what it's like
to feel something...

550
00:57:01.686 --> 00:57:04.450
so strong...

551
00:57:04.489 --> 00:57:06.423
that every day you have
to keep telling yourself

552
00:57:06.458 --> 00:57:09.586
your dad's gonna come back and
take you away from this shithole.

553
00:57:09.628 --> 00:57:12.324
And that everything we
believed in was true.

554
00:57:12.397 --> 00:57:14.865
And that we were not crazy.

555
00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:20.295
Please.

556
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:27.200
Please.

557
00:57:30.816 --> 00:57:32.147
Your dad was right.

558
00:57:33.919 --> 00:57:35.147
What?

559
00:57:41.293 --> 00:57:42.851
He was right.

560
00:57:45.197 --> 00:57:47.427
About ancient astronauts...

561
00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.960
life on other planets...

562
00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:54.568
all of it.

563
00:57:58.944 --> 00:58:02.471
Yes. I knew... I knew he
wouldn't just leave us.

564
00:58:02.514 --> 00:58:04.443
I mean, they found
his truck near the

565
00:58:04.444 --> 00:58:06.473
border of Mexico, and
he was just gone.

566
00:58:06.518 --> 00:58:08.349
- Maybe they took him.
- Sam...

567
00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:10.718
If he knew you were
here, he'd come home.

568
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:14.122
- You can't tell anyone.
- No, I wouldn't.

569
00:58:14.159 --> 00:58:16.354
No, no, no. You gotta promise
me. Nobody knows this.

570
00:58:16.428 --> 00:58:20.558
There are others from where
I'm from looking for me.

571
00:58:20.632 --> 00:58:22.930
I'm not safe.

572
00:58:23.001 --> 00:58:27.938
Sam. I know you are in there.
Get your ass in the house, now.

573
00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.473
Wait until I get
inside and then go.

574
00:58:30.509 --> 00:58:32.238
Sam?

575
00:58:34.246 --> 00:58:35.474
I promise.

576
00:58:38.049 --> 00:58:40.745
Yes.

577
00:58:43.822 --> 00:58:45.346
Come on.

578
00:58:59.838 --> 00:59:01.738
Hey, you maniac.

579
00:59:01.806 --> 00:59:05.173
- Hello, son.
- Hey, what's with the...?

580
00:59:09.614 --> 00:59:10.614
Hello, Dad.

581
00:59:10.682 --> 00:59:12.741
Sheriff James says some
boys got hurt last night.

582
00:59:12.817 --> 00:59:14.876
Couple of them spent the
night in the hospital.

583
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.410
- You said it was four?
- Yeah, four.

584
00:59:16.488 --> 00:59:19.514
- On the football team.
- Yeah, that's right.

585
00:59:19.558 --> 00:59:21.882
Of course, none of
them are talking.

586
00:59:21.883 --> 00:59:23.892
That includes my own boy, Mark.

587
00:59:25.597 --> 00:59:29.727
- Your son is Mark?
- Yeah, that's right.

588
00:59:29.768 --> 00:59:31.793
You know, that was his
throwing arm that got hurt.

589
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:33.861
He said you were there.

590
00:59:36.107 --> 00:59:38.598
No. I was actually with a girl.

591
00:59:38.643 --> 00:59:42.739
So I wasn't paying
any attention...

592
00:59:42.781 --> 00:59:43.805
Sarah Hart?

593
00:59:47.519 --> 00:59:52.081
Well, no one wants to be the first
one to say what really happened.

594
00:59:52.123 --> 00:59:55.615
But, eventually, someone will.

595
00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.356
I'm sure you're right.
Thank you, Sheriff.

596
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.796
If we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

597
01:00:21.019 --> 01:00:23.681
- Four of them, huh?
- Yeah.

598
01:00:25.290 --> 01:00:27.053
Was it difficult?

599
01:00:27.926 --> 01:00:29.985
Piece of cake.

600
01:00:30.028 --> 01:00:32.656
Good. Means you're getting it.

601
01:00:32.697 --> 01:00:34.722
Go upstairs, pack your stuff.

602
01:00:34.799 --> 01:00:36.164
Because of last night?

603
01:00:36.234 --> 01:00:38.828
Because I don't like people
showing up asking questions.

604
01:00:38.903 --> 01:00:40.812
And I think this is
gonna raise a few.

605
01:00:40.813 --> 01:00:41.929
"They walk among us."

606
01:00:41.973 --> 01:00:43.873
What is this? Some more
"truth is out there" freaks?

607
01:00:43.942 --> 01:00:46.843
Except that's actually you.

608
01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:49.072
One of the kids must have
caught you on video.

609
01:00:49.147 --> 01:00:50.546
Oh, shit.

610
01:00:50.615 --> 01:00:52.674
He's some kind of freak.

611
01:00:52.717 --> 01:00:54.014
I can't get through the firewall.

612
01:00:54.052 --> 01:00:55.849
We have to go there and
take it down ourselves.

613
01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.047
Mogs see this, just
a matter of time.

614
01:00:58.123 --> 01:01:00.421
Pack your stuff. We're leaving.

615
01:01:01.793 --> 01:01:03.556
I'm not going.

616
01:01:04.929 --> 01:01:06.726
I'm sorry, what did you say?

617
01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:09.493
I'm not going.

618
01:01:09.534 --> 01:01:12.765
Ok. If you want to pick the
next place, that's fine...

619
01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:14.532
It's not my fight
and it never was.

620
01:01:14.606 --> 01:01:16.870
I can't even remember a
world before this one.

621
01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:18.772
Wait, wait...

622
01:01:18.843 --> 01:01:21.175
is this because of a girl?

623
01:01:23.014 --> 01:01:25.005
Go upstairs and get your stuff.

624
01:01:26.184 --> 01:01:29.381
- You're not my father.
- No, no, no. He's dead.

625
01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:32.254
He died for you. In
fact, you know what?

626
01:01:32.323 --> 01:01:34.354
You have no idea how
many others have

627
01:01:34.355 --> 01:01:36.225
made sacrifices so you could live.

628
01:01:36.294 --> 01:01:37.784
And it wasn't so you
could come here

629
01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:40.023
and experience puppy love
like a real live boy.

630
01:01:40.065 --> 01:01:41.760
I'm not leaving.

631
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:47.436
John... John.

632
01:01:47.505 --> 01:01:48.767
I'm not leaving.

633
01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:53.602
Oh, yeah, I can do that now.

634
01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.044
Hey, John.

635
01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:14.464
I'm letting go, ok?

636
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.363
- Ok?
- Ok.

637
01:02:28.274 --> 01:02:29.274
On our planet...

638
01:02:29.275 --> 01:02:31.440
Just tell me why they
want to kill me.

639
01:02:31.483 --> 01:02:33.828
The Mogs, they don't
colonise. They

640
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:35.977
decimate. And then they move on.

641
01:02:36.054 --> 01:02:38.750
And now, they've moved here.

642
01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:43.727
There are few forces that can stop
them. You and the other five can.

643
01:02:43.762 --> 01:02:45.423
You were saved for
a bigger purpose.

644
01:02:45.463 --> 01:02:49.126
I'm not gonna let you throw
that away for a girl.

645
01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:51.635
She's not just a girl.

646
01:02:54.172 --> 01:02:56.299
I think about leaving her...

647
01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:58.932
but I can't.

648
01:02:58.977 --> 01:03:01.411
And I don't know why.

649
01:03:05.383 --> 01:03:09.285
We don't love like the humans.
With us, it's forever.

650
01:03:13.391 --> 01:03:15.222
You never forget.

651
01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:22.166
If she is that for you,
then don't let them win.

652
01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.566
Or you'll never forgive yourself.

653
01:03:27.672 --> 01:03:28.696
Now, we have to go.

654
01:03:30.008 --> 01:03:32.670
I'll take care of the website
tonight. Buy you a day.

655
01:03:32.744 --> 01:03:36.578
A day? To say goodbye?

656
01:03:36.648 --> 01:03:38.878
That's more than the
rest of us had.

657
01:03:57.368 --> 01:03:59.268
He's some kind of freak.

658
01:04:09.881 --> 01:04:12.577
Henri, I'm going to Sarah's.

659
01:04:16.521 --> 01:04:17.545
Henri?

660
01:04:38.843 --> 01:04:41.607
Henri? Hello? Henri?

661
01:04:41.679 --> 01:04:46.309
No, but come here and I'll
tell you how to find him.

662
01:04:46.384 --> 01:04:48.181
Who are you? Where's Henri?

663
01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:51.120
417 Willard Court,
Warsaw, Indiana.

664
01:05:01.933 --> 01:05:04.231
Come on, come on.

665
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:05.793
I need your help.

666
01:05:10.975 --> 01:05:12.806
So, you guys... you guys don't...

667
01:05:12.877 --> 01:05:15.209
- Abduct people?
- Yeah.

668
01:05:15.246 --> 01:05:16.270
No.

669
01:05:16.314 --> 01:05:19.772
But the other guys, the ones
that are chasing you...

670
01:05:19.851 --> 01:05:21.011
they do?

671
01:05:42.407 --> 01:05:43.897
That's it.

672
01:05:45.777 --> 01:05:47.108
Thanks.

673
01:05:54.886 --> 01:05:57.377
Whoa. You brought a gun?

674
01:05:57.455 --> 01:06:00.447
I stole it from Ed. It might
come in handy. Let's go.

675
01:06:00.525 --> 01:06:03.858
- No.
- Dude, I came here to help you.

676
01:06:03.928 --> 01:06:07.455
You have. Now, go home.

677
01:06:25.717 --> 01:06:27.378
Whoa.

678
01:06:30.121 --> 01:06:32.180
- What are you doing?
- I'm not bailing.

679
01:06:32.256 --> 01:06:33.985
What if these Mog
people took my dad?

680
01:07:06.024 --> 01:07:10.461
Holy shit.

681
01:07:10.528 --> 01:07:12.689
But you just dead-bolted it.

682
01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:16.894
- Ok. New plan.
- Yeah.

683
01:07:16.968 --> 01:07:20.062
You follow that guy and you
text me if he comes back, ok?

684
01:07:20.104 --> 01:07:21.935
Copy that. I'm on it.

685
01:08:56.167 --> 01:08:57.191
Henri.

686
01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:13.446
- Are you ok?
- You're not supposed to be here.

687
01:09:13.484 --> 01:09:15.645
- What happened?
- The Mogs set this up.

688
01:09:15.686 --> 01:09:18.519
We need to leave. They're coming.

689
01:09:18.556 --> 01:09:21.525
Everybody stays right where they
are or I'll shoot this kid.

690
01:09:21.559 --> 01:09:24.153
I'll do it. Get your hands up.

691
01:09:24.195 --> 01:09:25.492
So glad you brought the gun.

692
01:09:26.864 --> 01:09:28.195
You're Malcolm's boy.

693
01:09:29.534 --> 01:09:32.799
- Get the lights, will you?
- Shut up. Get your hands up.

694
01:09:38.676 --> 01:09:39.700
Oh.

695
01:09:44.849 --> 01:09:48.376
You. You're the one from
the video on our site.

696
01:09:48.452 --> 01:09:51.512
- The one they're after.
- The one who's after?

697
01:09:51.556 --> 01:09:54.354
- What's he talking about?
- The Mogs, they've been here.

698
01:09:54.392 --> 01:09:55.723
- This was a trap.
- Yeah.

699
01:09:55.793 --> 01:09:57.488
These dudes, whatever
they are, man,

700
01:09:57.489 --> 01:09:59.162
they got plans, know
what I'm saying?

701
01:09:59.163 --> 01:10:00.163
John...

702
01:10:00.164 --> 01:10:01.561
I'm that guy, the conspiracy guy.

703
01:10:01.599 --> 01:10:04.534
Nobody gives a crap what I
say. But this is real, man.

704
01:10:04.569 --> 01:10:05.968
John. It's time to leave.

705
01:10:06.037 --> 01:10:07.731
They like it here, Earth. They're

706
01:10:07.732 --> 01:10:09.734
gonna take all this
shit, everything.

707
01:10:09.807 --> 01:10:11.104
John. Now.

708
01:10:11.175 --> 01:10:13.200
We either do what they say
or we are all gonna die.

709
01:10:13.244 --> 01:10:15.712
It's time to go. Now.

710
01:10:31.696 --> 01:10:34.790
John. John. John, no.

711
01:11:09.233 --> 01:11:11.098
John, go.

712
01:11:11.135 --> 01:11:12.602
- Now.
- Go.

713
01:11:38.763 --> 01:11:41.288
Start the car. Come on.
Get us out of here.

714
01:11:41.332 --> 01:11:43.027
- I can't find the keys.
- What do you mean?

715
01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.591
- I can't find the keys.
- Come on. Come on.

716
01:11:46.437 --> 01:11:48.667
Guys, what are we waiting for?

717
01:11:50.508 --> 01:11:52.408
- I've lost the keys.
- John, start the engine.

718
01:11:52.476 --> 01:11:55.604
- What?
- You can do it. Start the car.

719
01:11:58.382 --> 01:12:00.612
- Come on.
- Start the car.

720
01:12:07.358 --> 01:12:09.553
Whoa, whoa. Come on, come on.
He's coming. He's coming.

721
01:12:09.627 --> 01:12:11.026
Start the car. Start the car.

722
01:12:11.062 --> 01:12:13.963
Use your magic powers.
Come on. We are so dead.

723
01:12:15.466 --> 01:12:18.026
Oh, my God.

724
01:12:22.006 --> 01:12:24.236
Go. Drive the car.

725
01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:37.548
You take this.

726
01:12:42.893 --> 01:12:45.361
Malcolm was using it
to track the others.

727
01:12:45.396 --> 01:12:48.661
- Wait. So, my dad was...
- He was helping us.

728
01:12:48.699 --> 01:12:50.894
He was supposed to
bring us together.

729
01:12:52.703 --> 01:12:54.034
You need to find the others.

730
01:12:54.972 --> 01:12:56.462
Together you'll be more powerful.

731
01:13:09.019 --> 01:13:10.919
I can't do this without you.

732
01:13:13.023 --> 01:13:14.285
Yes, you can.

733
01:13:15.993 --> 01:13:17.688
Yes, you can.

734
01:13:19.797 --> 01:13:23.756
You have no idea what
you're capable of.

735
01:13:30.007 --> 01:13:31.031
Henri.

736
01:14:26.997 --> 01:14:28.430
Just let me talk.

737
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.762
Ok. So, I called
you like you said.

738
01:14:34.672 --> 01:14:37.038
I mean, it's not my
fault they got...

739
01:14:38.809 --> 01:14:40.800
I mean, we held up our end.

740
01:14:40.845 --> 01:14:43.336
We're still in?

741
01:14:43.414 --> 01:14:46.713
The whole new world order thing?

742
01:14:46.784 --> 01:14:50.777
The Locator.

743
01:14:50.821 --> 01:14:53.483
- Where is it?
- Ok.

744
01:14:53.524 --> 01:14:57.688
All he had was a
knife and that rock.

745
01:14:59.029 --> 01:15:00.121
And I put it...

746
01:15:02.233 --> 01:15:06.602
- It was over there, man.
- "It was over there, man."

747
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.729
But it's not there now.

748
01:15:30.995 --> 01:15:35.227
Cartoons for children.

749
01:15:35.266 --> 01:15:37.860
Where I'm from, men have to work.

750
01:15:37.902 --> 01:15:39.767
Look, I'll work hard.

751
01:15:39.837 --> 01:15:43.500
The disregard that so many of
you have for practical matters,

752
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:48.103
it's... beautiful.

753
01:15:48.178 --> 01:15:50.305
I think we should all
have some fun. Huh?

754
01:15:52.249 --> 01:15:55.309
Gadgets. You call
them "toys for boys."

755
01:15:56.854 --> 01:15:58.617
I have a gadget.

756
01:15:58.689 --> 01:16:02.557
- Would you like to play with it?
- No, no. I...

757
01:16:02.593 --> 01:16:06.996
It wants to play with you.

758
01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:21.906
Need to talk to you.

759
01:16:21.946 --> 01:16:23.937
Any idea where I might
find your friend?

760
01:16:23.981 --> 01:16:26.609
He's not who you think he is.

761
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:28.481
Excuse me?

762
01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:35.550
The Paradise Sheriff's Department

763
01:16:35.593 --> 01:16:37.288
raided the home of two suspects,

764
01:16:37.328 --> 01:16:40.092
seizing computers and
several suspicious items.

765
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:43.463
An APB has been issued on the
suspects and anyone with...

766
01:16:46.937 --> 01:16:48.461
We need to get out of here.

767
01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.935
There's a news thing.

768
01:16:51.976 --> 01:16:55.139
The cops think you and Henri
are criminals or terrorists.

769
01:17:05.889 --> 01:17:07.481
We're going back.

770
01:17:10.694 --> 01:17:12.662
I'm outside of the
home here in Warsaw

771
01:17:12.696 --> 01:17:15.859
where the mutilated bodies of two
paranormal website operators

772
01:17:15.933 --> 01:17:17.958
were just found a few hours ago.

773
01:17:18.002 --> 01:17:19.799
The police are not saying
if they have any leads

774
01:17:19.837 --> 01:17:22.203
or even why these brutal
murders occurred.

775
01:17:22.272 --> 01:17:24.604
Police have no suspects
at this time...

776
01:17:35.319 --> 01:17:36.809
- I have one of those.
- What?

777
01:17:36.854 --> 01:17:39.618
One of those. I took it
from my dad's stash.

778
01:17:39.657 --> 01:17:41.852
- I need you to get it.
- Yeah, yeah.

779
01:17:41.925 --> 01:17:45.417
Let me off at Linndale.
Sarah's at a house up there.

780
01:17:45.496 --> 01:17:47.197
I'll call you after.

781
01:17:47.198 --> 01:17:48.198
And then what?

782
01:17:48.199 --> 01:17:49.864
Then I get the rock
and you go home.

783
01:18:00.911 --> 01:18:03.038
- It's him.
- John?

784
01:18:03.647 --> 01:18:06.980
- Did you see that?
- What's he doing here?

785
01:18:08.552 --> 01:18:09.678
Yeah, he's here.

786
01:18:14.425 --> 01:18:15.585
That's him.

787
01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:33.602
Come on.

788
01:18:35.112 --> 01:18:36.272
Come on.

789
01:18:59.203 --> 01:19:01.694
Doesn't seem like
your kind of crowd.

790
01:19:04.608 --> 01:19:07.771
Not so sure who my kind
of crowd is right now.

791
01:19:07.811 --> 01:19:10.405
- Look, just...
- John Smith?

792
01:19:10.447 --> 01:19:12.381
I'm such an idiot.

793
01:19:13.751 --> 01:19:16.982
And they're saying that your
dad is some kind of terrorist.

794
01:19:17.054 --> 01:19:19.181
He's not a terrorist.

795
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:21.189
Tell me the truth.

796
01:19:22.159 --> 01:19:24.389
Who are you?

797
01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:36.100
He's upstairs.

798
01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.737
All right, guys, out of the way.

799
01:19:40.711 --> 01:19:42.941
You didn't answer my question.

800
01:19:43.814 --> 01:19:45.441
I just came to say goodbye.

801
01:19:45.482 --> 01:19:46.940
John, wait. What are
you... No, John.

802
01:19:46.941 --> 01:19:47.941
Don't move.

803
01:19:47.942 --> 01:19:49.884
Sarah.

804
01:19:59.096 --> 01:20:00.120
How...

805
01:20:00.164 --> 01:20:01.631
- Move. Move.
- Go.

806
01:20:17.314 --> 01:20:18.975
That was awesome.

807
01:20:19.016 --> 01:20:22.452
Whoa...

808
01:20:28.091 --> 01:20:29.991
What you did is not possible.

809
01:20:30.027 --> 01:20:31.551
Who I am...

810
01:20:31.628 --> 01:20:33.596
it's all in here. I
took these for you.

811
01:20:33.664 --> 01:20:37.395
Wait. Come with me. Please.

812
01:20:38.335 --> 01:20:40.701
Any idea where they'd be?

813
01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:43.205
I think I know where she might go.

814
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:56.686
- Who the hell are they?
- Big-ass linebackers?

815
01:21:04.995 --> 01:21:07.190
Holy shit...

816
01:21:11.201 --> 01:21:12.964
No, no, no.

817
01:21:15.672 --> 01:21:16.764
Dad.

818
01:21:29.253 --> 01:21:33.087
An alcohol-fuelled
young guy like you...

819
01:21:33.156 --> 01:21:36.990
healthy and well-fed.

820
01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.138
I bet you watch a
lot of television,

821
01:21:39.139 --> 01:21:40.655
don't you? Do you? Do you?

822
01:21:40.731 --> 01:21:42.926
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

823
01:21:42.966 --> 01:21:45.526
In this situation here,
you're probably thinking,

824
01:21:45.569 --> 01:21:48.766
"Maybe I could save the day.
Maybe I could be the hero."

825
01:21:48.839 --> 01:21:53.071
But I say... don't do that.

826
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:54.805
Ok?

827
01:21:56.513 --> 01:21:59.744
Tell me now, where is the boy?

828
01:22:27.311 --> 01:22:29.836
These are beautiful.

829
01:22:44.461 --> 01:22:45.985
Can you show me?

830
01:23:13.824 --> 01:23:16.190
- No.
- Get in.

831
01:23:20.397 --> 01:23:23.889
Let me go. Let me go.

832
01:23:28.672 --> 01:23:29.900
Let go of me.

833
01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:39.381
- Hello?
- Where are you?

834
01:23:39.416 --> 01:23:40.508
I'm at the high school.

835
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:42.313
Yeah, you need to get
out of there now.

836
01:23:42.352 --> 01:23:43.376
Why? What's happening?

837
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.218
Your stunt with the car
is already on YouTube.

838
01:23:46.289 --> 01:23:47.688
If they're not right
on your ass now,

839
01:23:47.724 --> 01:23:49.453
they will be soon.

840
01:23:50.027 --> 01:23:51.392
Come on.

841
01:23:51.428 --> 01:23:53.589
And don't tell me
this is not my fight.

842
01:23:53.663 --> 01:23:55.882
My dad probably knew
those guys were

843
01:23:55.883 --> 01:23:58.100
coming and that's
why they took him.

844
01:23:58.735 --> 01:24:01.727
And also, I have your dog.

845
01:24:02.572 --> 01:24:03.732
Look, I'm on my way.

846
01:24:03.774 --> 01:24:05.264
I'll meet you out
front of the school.

847
01:24:05.342 --> 01:24:07.207
You've got to get out now.

848
01:24:07.778 --> 01:24:09.370
John?

849
01:24:09.413 --> 01:24:10.471
John.

850
01:24:15.118 --> 01:24:16.449
Let's go.

851
01:24:20.023 --> 01:24:23.254
Let go of me.

852
01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:29.755
Jesus.

853
01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.600
Sarah. If you're in there, run.

854
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:36.400
Run.

855
01:24:39.943 --> 01:24:42.912
Let me go.

856
01:24:48.752 --> 01:24:51.653
Listen to me. I'm not gonna
let them hurt you, ok?

857
01:24:51.721 --> 01:24:54.383
Do you understand me? Come on.

858
01:26:08.165 --> 01:26:09.661
It'd be a good idea,
cowboy, if you

859
01:26:09.662 --> 01:26:11.157
kept your heroics
off the Internet.

860
01:26:13.503 --> 01:26:14.621
Who are you?

861
01:26:14.622 --> 01:26:17.735
Number Six. Where's
your protector?

862
01:26:17.807 --> 01:26:21.208
- Dead.
- Yeah. Mine, too.

863
01:26:21.244 --> 01:26:22.677
Mogs got her four months ago.

864
01:26:22.712 --> 01:26:25.272
- We've been tracking them down.
- Tracking them?

865
01:26:25.348 --> 01:26:27.578
Yeah. Lucky for you,
I saved your ass.

866
01:26:27.651 --> 01:26:29.881
You should be watching
your own ass.

867
01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.218
Mogs have all the exits covered.

868
01:26:32.255 --> 01:26:35.247
Looks like you're gonna
have to fight to get out.

869
01:26:35.325 --> 01:26:37.555
- Are you game?
- Yeah.

870
01:26:37.594 --> 01:26:40.028
There's a tunnel under the school
that leads to the stadium.

871
01:26:40.063 --> 01:26:42.827
Oh, you made friends. How nice.

872
01:26:44.901 --> 01:26:46.198
Let's go.

873
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:50.064
Got any other legacies
I should know about?

874
01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:51.698
Stay tuned.

875
01:27:23.873 --> 01:27:26.341
Oh, shit.

876
01:27:33.783 --> 01:27:35.216
Oh, shit.

877
01:27:44.961 --> 01:27:46.792
Careful, they'll see us.

878
01:27:48.098 --> 01:27:49.998
And you're going to
need all your energy.

879
01:27:54.104 --> 01:27:57.096
- What was that?
- They're coming.

880
01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.608
Ah. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

881
01:27:59.643 --> 01:28:02.134
Whoa. Sam, what are you doing?

882
01:28:02.179 --> 01:28:03.679
Did you see what just
flew out of that truck?

883
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:05.808
And your dog just shape-shifted
into one of them.

884
01:28:05.882 --> 01:28:09.010
I thought he was gonna eat
me. Here's your rock.

885
01:28:11.087 --> 01:28:15.023
Hi. I'm Sam. What's your name?

886
01:28:16.026 --> 01:28:17.254
Jane Doe.

887
01:28:17.294 --> 01:28:18.591
That's cool. It's cool.

888
01:28:18.628 --> 01:28:19.993
So, are you a number, too?

889
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:23.022
- Who is this tool?
- Sam, focus.

890
01:28:23.099 --> 01:28:25.659
What flew out of the truck?

891
01:28:29.773 --> 01:28:32.333
Come on. Go, go.

892
01:28:32.375 --> 01:28:35.674
Sam. Come on. Go.

893
01:28:39.949 --> 01:28:41.712
Come on. Come on.

894
01:28:44.821 --> 01:28:47.153
Come on.

895
01:29:55.925 --> 01:29:58.257
- Hit me.
- What?

896
01:29:58.328 --> 01:30:00.728
With your lumen. I
need to power-up.

897
01:30:02.932 --> 01:30:04.297
Hit me.

898
01:30:15.278 --> 01:30:17.109
Red Bull's for pussies.

899
01:30:19.449 --> 01:30:21.576
He killed Henri. I want him.

900
01:30:53.283 --> 01:30:56.343
Ah.

901
01:30:58.154 --> 01:30:59.553
Four.

902
01:31:11.768 --> 01:31:13.861
You're good with your hands.

903
01:31:13.937 --> 01:31:15.905
- Thanks.
- No problem.

904
01:31:17.407 --> 01:31:21.707
- My dog, he, he just...
- Yeah, he's a chimaera.

905
01:31:21.778 --> 01:31:23.905
He came with you from Lorien.

906
01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:26.380
Someone had to look after you.

907
01:32:29.479 --> 01:32:31.572
You brought a gun?
Are you serious?

908
01:32:31.614 --> 01:32:34.048
- What? It might come in handy.
- This way.

909
01:32:44.761 --> 01:32:45.785
Go.

910
01:32:54.771 --> 01:32:56.405
- Take her back to the tunnel.
- Got it. Come on.

911
01:33:03.746 --> 01:33:05.976
Holy...

912
01:33:10.587 --> 01:33:11.884
I play a lot of Xbox.

913
01:33:18.194 --> 01:33:19.218
Oh.

914
01:33:39.482 --> 01:33:41.643
Oh.

915
01:34:51.487 --> 01:34:55.753
Number Four, I think you
have something I need?

916
01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.729
Oh, thank you for making
this so nice and easy.

917
01:35:01.764 --> 01:35:04.330
Think of how quickly
we'll finish off

918
01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:07.031
the rest of the planet.
It's fantastic.

919
01:35:07.770 --> 01:35:10.398
Soon, I'll be done
with all of you.

920
01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:12.704
Just relax.

921
01:35:14.110 --> 01:35:17.876
You can't stop what's
coming. You never could.

922
01:35:17.914 --> 01:35:20.007
You have...

923
01:35:20.049 --> 01:35:22.483
no idea...

924
01:35:23.686 --> 01:35:25.153
what I'm capable of.

925
01:35:41.404 --> 01:35:42.701
Ah.

926
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:40.823
John.

927
01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.795
Fireproof?

928
01:36:46.969 --> 01:36:49.335
I told you to stay tuned.

929
01:37:18.234 --> 01:37:20.361
All right, give me that. Come on.

930
01:37:21.237 --> 01:37:22.465
Thank you.

931
01:37:53.502 --> 01:37:57.495
Oh. Well, that was disappointing.
So, not a tracking device?

932
01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.599
No, it was.

933
01:37:59.675 --> 01:38:02.075
- Did you feel that, too?
- Yeah.

934
01:38:02.144 --> 01:38:05.307
- We know where we need to go.
- Yeah, we can find the others.

935
01:38:11.554 --> 01:38:14.751
- Here.
- Thank you.

936
01:38:15.725 --> 01:38:17.590
I hope this doesn't
get you in trouble.

937
01:38:17.627 --> 01:38:22.121
Nah. Stuff goes missing
from evidence all the time.

938
01:38:22.198 --> 01:38:24.598
My dad won't even know.

939
01:38:24.634 --> 01:38:27.535
- You want to be heading west now.
- Why?

940
01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:30.061
Because I told my dad
you're going east.

941
01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:41.882
- Six, Sam's coming with us.
- What?

942
01:38:42.985 --> 01:38:44.748
- No way.
- He's one of us now.

943
01:38:44.787 --> 01:38:47.017
We need to find his father.

944
01:38:50.626 --> 01:38:54.027
You slow us down, I'll
shoot you myself.

945
01:38:54.096 --> 01:38:56.564
And I believe you.
Could we go now?

946
01:39:02.538 --> 01:39:04.665
You know, I wouldn't
leave if it wasn't...

947
01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.504
- Safer.
- Yeah.

948
01:39:07.576 --> 01:39:09.134
I know.

949
01:39:10.346 --> 01:39:12.814
Really sorry about what
happened with Henri.

950
01:39:14.083 --> 01:39:15.846
Me, too.

951
01:39:19.221 --> 01:39:21.712
You know I'll find you again.

952
01:39:24.026 --> 01:39:27.018
Probably still be here.

953
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:29.822
It's the people that
make the place.

954
01:39:30.599 --> 01:39:32.931
- Right?
- Yeah.

955
01:39:39.275 --> 01:39:43.143
Henri warned me that we
only fall for one person.

956
01:39:45.348 --> 01:39:46.815
Ever?

957
01:39:47.650 --> 01:39:49.083
Ever.

958
01:41:21.877 --> 01:41:24.778
This is the first town
I've left without Henri.

959
01:41:25.714 --> 01:41:29.172
But it's also the first one I
have a reason to come back to.

960
01:41:30.553 --> 01:41:34.045
Henri was right, we're
stronger together.

961
01:41:34.590 --> 01:41:37.184
So we will find the others.

962
01:41:39.428 --> 01:41:44.058
My planet is called Lorien,
but Earth is my home now.

963
01:41:45.101 --> 01:41:48.798
It's as good a place as
any in the universe.

964
01:41:48.838 --> 01:41:51.272
And that's how it's going to stay.

965
01:41:51.473 --> 01:41:55.473
I Am Number Four...
