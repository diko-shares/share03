1
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.525
I forgot where I am.

2
00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:33.165
You're at the place
where the killers meet

3
00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.285
to decide what to do
with the crippled girl.

4
00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:37.685
Oh, that's right. That's right.

5
00:03:45.005 --> 00:03:46.725
Did you hear that?

6
00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:50.725
That's funny.

7
00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:55.965
That's weird. Those people look
like they're clawing at themselves.

8
00:03:56.845 --> 00:03:58.405
Is that blood?

9
00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:20.485
Claire, are you seeing this?

10
00:04:20.565 --> 00:04:21.845
Claire.

11
00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:24.445
Claire?

12
00:04:25.605 --> 00:04:27.325
Claire?

13
00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:29.325
What page was I on?

14
00:04:33.765 --> 00:04:35.125
Page.

15
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:02.605
- I need an extension over here.
- Fall back. Fall back.

16
00:05:02.685 --> 00:05:03.805
You kidding me?
Like another 20 feet.

17
00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:06.365
Don't touch that.
That's for the drywall guys.

18
00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:07.565
I told you he wouldn't do it!

19
00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:09.125
So then the little guy says,

20
00:05:09.205 --> 00:05:13.525
"You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too?
Well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY'."

21
00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:18.685
The big guy says, "No, man, mine says,
'Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."'

22
00:05:26.405 --> 00:05:28.565
Christ, McKenzie fell.

23
00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:40.085
Medic, we have a major accident
at the south side of the building.

24
00:05:40.165 --> 00:05:42.125
<i>- We'll need an ambulance.
- Copy.</i>

25
00:05:43.445 --> 00:05:44.685
Jesus.

26
00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.285
Give him some room.

27
00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:52.725
- Hey!
- Somebody fell!

28
00:05:52.805 --> 00:05:54.885
- Davis?
- Oh, my God, he just fell!

29
00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:58.325
Someone fell! Over that building!

30
00:06:02.085 --> 00:06:03.085
Oh, my God!

31
00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:04.205
- Watch it.
- Oh, my God!

32
00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:06.085
Watch it. Get out of there!

33
00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:11.765
- Help!
- Look out!

34
00:06:13.565 --> 00:06:14.965
Look out!

35
00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:27.405
God in heaven.

36
00:06:29.205 --> 00:06:31.005
Look, I don't know if you guys
have heard about this article

37
00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:32.925
<i>in The New York Times
about honeybees vanishing?</i>

38
00:06:33.845 --> 00:06:37.205
Well, apparently, honeybees are
disappearing all over the country.

39
00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:39.485
Tens of millions of them.
Just disappearing.

40
00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:42.925
There's no bodies, no sign of them.
They're just mysteriously gone.

41
00:06:43.005 --> 00:06:45.005
It's scary, huh?

42
00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:49.365
All right, let's hear some theories
about why this might be happening.

43
00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:51.485
Nothing? Come on, guys.

44
00:06:52.885 --> 00:06:55.085
- Laura.
- Disease?

45
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.005
Right. Could be a virus or infection.

46
00:06:58.045 --> 00:07:00.845
But it's all over the country.
It's a coordinated event in 24 states.

47
00:07:00.885 --> 00:07:03.285
It's a little tricky.

48
00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:04.765
- Pollution?
- Could be.

49
00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:07.165
I mean, we're just pumping
so much junk into the environment

50
00:07:07.285 --> 00:07:08.845
they're just keeling over.

51
00:07:08.885 --> 00:07:11.925
But there are no bodies. Keep guessing.

52
00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:13.485
Dylan.

53
00:07:13.525 --> 00:07:15.725
Global warming.

54
00:07:15.765 --> 00:07:19.405
Temperature goes up a fraction of a
degree, makes them disoriented?

55
00:07:19.485 --> 00:07:20.685
Maybe.

56
00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:24.445
Jake?

57
00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.885
You don't have an opinion?

58
00:07:28.725 --> 00:07:31.965
You're not interested
in what happened to the bees?

59
00:07:32.365 --> 00:07:34.445
You should be more interested
in science, Jake.

60
00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:38.045
You know why?
Because your face is perfect.

61
00:07:39.085 --> 00:07:41.725
The problem is,
your face is perfect at 15.

62
00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:43.885
Now, if you were interested in science,
you would know facts

63
00:07:43.925 --> 00:07:46.925
like the human nose and ears
grow a fraction of an inch each year.

64
00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:48.445
So a perfect balance of features now

65
00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.965
might not look so perfect
five years from now.

66
00:07:51.085 --> 00:07:54.405
They might look downright whack
10 years from now.

67
00:07:55.605 --> 00:07:58.125
Come on, buddy.
Take an interest in science.

68
00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:01.165
What could be a reason
the bees have vanished?

69
00:08:05.125 --> 00:08:09.005
An act of nature and
we'll never fully understand it.

70
00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:11.205
Nice answer, Jake.

71
00:08:11.285 --> 00:08:12.725
He's right.

72
00:08:12.845 --> 00:08:15.725
I mean, science will come up
with some reason to put in the books,

73
00:08:15.765 --> 00:08:18.005
but in the end, it'll be just a theory.

74
00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:23.085
We will fail to acknowledge that there are
forces at work beyond our understanding.

75
00:08:23.205 --> 00:08:25.005
To be a good scientist,

76
00:08:25.045 --> 00:08:28.525
you must have a respectful awe
for the laws of nature.

77
00:08:28.645 --> 00:08:29.685
Jake?

78
00:08:29.805 --> 00:08:31.725
How much does the human nose
grow each year?

79
00:08:31.765 --> 00:08:33.285
- Oh, man.
- It's minuscule, buddy, okay?

80
00:08:33.365 --> 00:08:35.525
Don't worry about it. You're gonna
be a heartthrob your whole life.

81
00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:37.765
I was just messing with you.

82
00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:45.485
The Dark Lord.
Don't look into her eyes.

83
00:08:50.285 --> 00:08:53.005
Vice Principal!
What can we do for you?

84
00:08:53.045 --> 00:08:56.805
I'm afraid I have to interrupt you
for a moment, Mr. Moore.

85
00:08:57.605 --> 00:08:59.725
Okay, guys, calm down.
I'll be right back.

86
00:09:01.525 --> 00:09:03.125
- What is that?
- I can't believe it.

87
00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:05.205
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

88
00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:08.045
- I've never seen anything like it before.
- What's going on?

89
00:09:08.085 --> 00:09:09.285
I don't know.

90
00:09:10.005 --> 00:09:12.245
You excused all the teachers?

91
00:09:12.365 --> 00:09:14.925
The administration makes us teach
with a foot of snow on the ground.

92
00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:16.485
What is this?

93
00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:19.605
- They stopped class.
- Elliot!

94
00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:22.725
All right.

95
00:09:24.165 --> 00:09:26.245
There appears to be an event happening.

96
00:09:27.405 --> 00:09:30.925
Central Park was just hit by
what seems to be a terrorist attack.

97
00:09:31.005 --> 00:09:32.285
Oh, no.

98
00:09:32.645 --> 00:09:35.245
They're not clear on the scale yet.

99
00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:37.485
It's some kind of
airborne chemical toxin

100
00:09:37.605 --> 00:09:40.645
that's been released
in and around the park.

101
00:09:40.725 --> 00:09:43.365
They said to watch
for warning signs.

102
00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:46.285
The first stage
is confused speech.

103
00:09:46.365 --> 00:09:50.765
The second stage is physical
disorientation, loss of direction.

104
00:09:50.885 --> 00:09:53.565
The third stage is fatal.

105
00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:56.805
Central Park? That's kind of odd.

106
00:09:56.885 --> 00:10:00.845
I spoke with the head of schools.
He said we should dismiss the students.

107
00:10:00.965 --> 00:10:04.685
So take your planners home
so we can get back when this is over.

108
00:10:04.765 --> 00:10:07.325
All right? Let's do our jobs.

109
00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:12.005
Hey, you guys still got to work on
your science projects for next week.

110
00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:14.285
What are the rules of
scientific investigation?

111
00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:17.645
Identify variables.
Design the experiment.

112
00:10:17.725 --> 00:10:22.285
Careful observation and measurement.
Interpretation of experimental data.

113
00:10:23.685 --> 00:10:25.005
Hey, guys?

114
00:10:28.325 --> 00:10:29.605
Nothing.

115
00:10:35.765 --> 00:10:37.165
Alacrity. With alacrity, please.

116
00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:41.805
My mother just called my cell again.
She's hysterical. Hysterical.

117
00:10:41.925 --> 00:10:46.405
I told her the probability of something
happening in Philadelphia is very low.

118
00:10:46.485 --> 00:10:48.925
I mean, nobody's telling us
to leave the city, right?

119
00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:52.325
So I threw some figures at her.
It's good to be a math teacher sometimes.

120
00:10:52.405 --> 00:10:55.565
You know, people are comforted
by percentages. Didn't work.

121
00:10:55.645 --> 00:10:57.805
She still wants us to get out of
the city and come out to her house.

122
00:10:57.885 --> 00:11:00.365
But she said for
you and Alma to come.

123
00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:02.085
Yeah, let me think
about that, okay?

124
00:11:02.445 --> 00:11:04.685
Did you hear about New York?

125
00:11:04.765 --> 00:11:06.285
Are you okay?

126
00:11:06.405 --> 00:11:08.485
No, I mean, are you okay?

127
00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:11.005
Yeah, me, too.
Listen, I want to talk about it more.

128
00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:13.165
Julian's mom offered for all of us to
get out of the city and stay with her.

129
00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:14.245
What do you think?

130
00:11:17.565 --> 00:11:19.005
Yo, Chris!

131
00:11:20.445 --> 00:11:22.685
I'll bring Jess and Evette
and I'll meet you at the station.

132
00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:26.085
Listen, Julian, if Alma's acting
weird, just be cool, okay?

133
00:11:26.205 --> 00:11:27.245
What's going on?

134
00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:31.165
She's acting odd.
Just don't worry about it, okay?

135
00:11:31.245 --> 00:11:32.525
Odd?

136
00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:36.365
Look, if she's acting like
she's distant or something...

137
00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:38.045
What?

138
00:11:38.285 --> 00:11:40.045
I can't say any more.

139
00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:41.725
Is she leaving you?

140
00:11:41.805 --> 00:11:45.605
I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay?
Just relax, please?

141
00:11:47.605 --> 00:11:48.605
Hey.

142
00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:53.285
I'm going to tell you something you
should never tell your best friend.

143
00:11:53.365 --> 00:11:55.565
Why is everybody saying that?

144
00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:57.765
I saw her on your wedding day.

145
00:11:57.845 --> 00:12:00.045
Again with the wedding. What?

146
00:12:01.245 --> 00:12:03.885
I walked into a waiting room by mistake,
and she was crying.

147
00:12:03.965 --> 00:12:06.605
She looked up. I saw her face.

148
00:12:07.565 --> 00:12:09.805
She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot.
That's not who she is.

149
00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:13.205
She's never going to jump in
when you need her, man.

150
00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:17.245
<i>So do federal, state and local
officials have a plan in place</i>

151
00:12:17.325 --> 00:12:18.285
<i>for this type of catastrophe?</i>

152
00:12:18.405 --> 00:12:21.725
<i>Are they utilizing all the
manpower or the money...</i>

153
00:12:49.005 --> 00:12:50.445
- Hi.
- Are you packed?

154
00:12:50.565 --> 00:12:52.205
- Yes.
- What are they saying?

155
00:12:52.285 --> 00:12:54.685
They're evacuating New York City.

156
00:12:55.765 --> 00:12:59.045
<i>Well, our brains come equipped
with a self-preservation mechanism</i>

157
00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:01.165
<i>to stop us from harmful actions.</i>

158
00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:05.285
<i>This is controlled by a combination
of electrochemical signals in the brain.</i>

159
00:13:05.365 --> 00:13:08.845
<i>The blocking of neurotransmitters
by certain toxins</i>

160
00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:13.245
<i>has been proven to cause hallucinations,
asphyxiation and paralysis.</i>

161
00:13:13.325 --> 00:13:17.405
<i>This new neurotoxin is basically
flipping the preservation switch,</i>

162
00:13:17.485 --> 00:13:20.325
<i>blocking neurotransmitters
in a specific order,</i>

163
00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:24.285
<i>causing specific self-damaging
and catastrophic effects.</i>

164
00:13:24.365 --> 00:13:26.605
<i>Just how the toxin works
and who the terrorists are...</i>

165
00:13:26.725 --> 00:13:28.685
It makes you kill yourself.

166
00:13:28.805 --> 00:13:33.405
Just when you thought there couldn't be
any more evil that could be invented.

167
00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:35.725
I'll be packed in two minutes.

168
00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:11.565
<i>Hello?</i>

169
00:14:19.765 --> 00:14:22.925
- No need to rush.
- Sir. Thank you.

170
00:14:23.005 --> 00:14:25.485
Sir, we need to check your suitcase.

171
00:14:26.645 --> 00:14:28.925
Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!

172
00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:35.405
<i>This just in to the Eyewitness News
room and this is the latest development.</i>

173
00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:40.125
<i>Autopsies on the first victims confirm
the toxin is a natural compound.</i>

174
00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:44.205
<i>The attacks remain confined
to the New York metropolitan area.</i>

175
00:14:44.325 --> 00:14:45.805
<i>This is a very,
very disturbing story...</i>

176
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:48.165
<i>Track three now
boarding for Harrisburg.</i>

177
00:14:48.245 --> 00:14:50.285
Hey, Jess. Where's Evette?

178
00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:53.125
She was at a shop across town,
she got stuck in traffic.

179
00:14:53.205 --> 00:14:54.885
- She's gonna take the next train.
- We'll wait.

180
00:14:54.965 --> 00:14:56.685
No, no, no. She wanted us
to get on this train with Jess.

181
00:14:56.805 --> 00:14:57.805
She'll feel a lot safer.

182
00:14:57.925 --> 00:14:59.885
- Where's Alma?
- Restroom.

183
00:15:02.205 --> 00:15:03.365
Hey, Julian!

184
00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:06.125
Please have your tickets out and ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:15:06.205 --> 00:15:07.565
I bought them.

186
00:15:07.645 --> 00:15:09.565
It was like getting one
of those Cabbage Patch Dolls

187
00:15:09.645 --> 00:15:11.245
when they first came out.

188
00:15:11.325 --> 00:15:13.005
Madhouse. How are you?

189
00:15:13.085 --> 00:15:15.245
- Good. You?
- Good.

190
00:15:16.605 --> 00:15:20.845
- Okay, good. Why don't we all...
- I'm really glad you chose to come.

191
00:15:22.645 --> 00:15:26.725
Thanks. Elliot, can I
talk to you for a second?

192
00:15:26.805 --> 00:15:27.885
Yeah.

193
00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:32.685
Please show me your tickets,
ladies and gentlemen.

194
00:15:32.805 --> 00:15:35.885
- You told him about our fight?
- No.

195
00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:38.125
- Why did he say that?
- He guessed.

196
00:15:38.205 --> 00:15:41.605
I love you, Elliot, but I don't like to put
my feelings out there for everyone to see.

197
00:15:41.685 --> 00:15:43.685
I'm not that type of person.

198
00:15:43.765 --> 00:15:46.125
Elliot, these are our problems.

199
00:15:47.245 --> 00:15:50.085
I am upset.
I'm going to sit alone and cool off.

200
00:15:50.165 --> 00:15:52.445
By the time we get there I'll be fine.
Is that okay?

201
00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:53.645
Fine.

202
00:16:00.205 --> 00:16:01.485
I'm going to get on the train.

203
00:16:01.605 --> 00:16:04.045
We're not gonna
get to sit together anyways.

204
00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:05.325
Okay.

205
00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:11.085
Hey, babe.

206
00:16:11.165 --> 00:16:13.165
- Hi, Aunt Alma.
- How you doing?

207
00:16:13.285 --> 00:16:15.565
- Hanging in there.
- Me, too.

208
00:16:19.885 --> 00:16:21.565
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

209
00:16:21.645 --> 00:16:24.045
You're wrong about her.
She just needs time to figure it out.

210
00:16:24.165 --> 00:16:25.525
Come on, don't get all sensitive.

211
00:16:25.605 --> 00:16:28.325
- Just give her a chance.
- Okay, fine. If you don't want my help...

212
00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:30.525
- I don't want your help!
- Okay. I heard it.

213
00:16:30.605 --> 00:16:33.725
Jess, could you ask your dad
for my ticket, please?

214
00:16:33.805 --> 00:16:36.685
Thank you.
I'll see you on the train, Jess.

215
00:16:37.285 --> 00:16:40.645
<i>Track 3 now boarding
all ticketed passengers.</i>

216
00:16:40.725 --> 00:16:42.085
Here we go.

217
00:16:42.925 --> 00:16:45.125
When will Mom meet us at Grandma's?

218
00:16:45.205 --> 00:16:49.045
Mommy's gonna get on the next train.
You know how she's always late.

219
00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:17.005
- Come on. Come on. I know. I know.
- Mom.

220
00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:31.205
- Chilly, isn't it today, Sal?
- Maybe a little.

221
00:18:35.765 --> 00:18:39.325
Hey, it's me. I'm on a train.
I just want to say something, okay?

222
00:18:39.405 --> 00:18:40.885
You've got to stop calling me.

223
00:18:40.965 --> 00:18:42.925
<i>You're acting like the
Fatal Attraction guy, here.</i>

224
00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:45.085
I feel like I'm
going to take a shower

225
00:18:45.165 --> 00:18:48.165
and see your silhouette
on the shower curtain.

226
00:18:48.765 --> 00:18:52.325
We ate tiramisu together,
that is it.

227
00:18:52.405 --> 00:18:56.245
I told you that would be it.
You have got to chill out.

228
00:18:58.805 --> 00:18:59.925
What?

229
00:19:01.485 --> 00:19:03.005
When?

230
00:19:03.085 --> 00:19:04.685
In Philadelphia?

231
00:19:04.965 --> 00:19:09.085
- I don't know. What did you hear?
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

232
00:19:09.485 --> 00:19:10.565
What's the news?

233
00:19:10.645 --> 00:19:13.485
Apparently Philadelphia
was just attacked.

234
00:19:14.685 --> 00:19:17.685
- Oh, my God. Evette.
- Call Mommy. Call Mommy!

235
00:19:24.205 --> 00:19:25.725
Honey!

236
00:19:25.805 --> 00:19:28.005
Honey...
Yeah, yeah, where are you?

237
00:19:28.085 --> 00:19:30.805
What? What?
I can't hear you.

238
00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:34.885
I said I can't hear you!
Text me.

239
00:19:35.725 --> 00:19:37.965
Text me. I can't hear you!

240
00:19:38.765 --> 00:19:41.405
They think it started
in Rittenhouse Square Park.

241
00:19:41.485 --> 00:19:43.085
Another park?

242
00:19:48.525 --> 00:19:51.085
- She got on a bus going to New Jersey.
- I want to talk to her.

243
00:19:51.165 --> 00:19:53.725
I know, baby. I know. She got out.
She's headed to the town of Princeton.

244
00:19:53.805 --> 00:19:55.645
I want to talk to her.

245
00:20:06.725 --> 00:20:08.845
- Do you have a phone?
- No, I'm sorry.

246
00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:12.845
- You okay?
- They say Boston got hit, too.

247
00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:15.605
- Where'd you hear that?
- A friend from work. What about Evette?

248
00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:17.565
Oh, God. She made it out on a bus.

249
00:20:17.645 --> 00:20:20.165
What the hell is going on, Elliot?

250
00:20:22.405 --> 00:20:24.245
I honestly don't know.

251
00:20:48.685 --> 00:20:49.965
Now what?

252
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.765
It just stopped. I don't know.

253
00:20:53.045 --> 00:20:54.685
- Can't go nowhere.
- They're not telling us anything.

254
00:20:54.765 --> 00:20:57.045
- Well, until we hear from...
- Sir?

255
00:20:57.125 --> 00:20:58.565
Train service has
been discontinued.

256
00:20:58.685 --> 00:21:01.845
This will be the last stop
for all passengers.

257
00:21:01.925 --> 00:21:04.685
Hey! What do you mean?
Where are we?

258
00:21:06.205 --> 00:21:07.525
Filbert, Pennsylvania.

259
00:21:07.605 --> 00:21:10.725
Filbert?
Does anybody know where that is?

260
00:21:10.805 --> 00:21:13.485
Why are you giving me one useless
piece of information at a time?

261
00:21:13.565 --> 00:21:15.165
What's going on?

262
00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:18.365
Hey, why would you just stop?
You can't just leave us here.

263
00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:21.685
Sir, we lost contact.

264
00:21:21.765 --> 00:21:23.165
With whom?

265
00:21:25.645 --> 00:21:27.005
Everyone.

266
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:31.845
I'm scared. I don't like it here.
I want Mom.

267
00:21:31.925 --> 00:21:34.645
Don't be silly.
We're safe here, okay?

268
00:21:38.605 --> 00:21:41.645
Sorry. She whispers to us
when she gets scared.

269
00:21:43.005 --> 00:21:47.405
We're so much the same, Jess.
I don't like to show my emotions, either.

270
00:21:48.765 --> 00:21:49.925
She's shivering.

271
00:21:50.005 --> 00:21:52.485
I know. I know.
She's never right without her mom.

272
00:21:52.565 --> 00:21:53.645
It's okay.

273
00:21:53.725 --> 00:21:55.245
They're not saying anything.

274
00:21:55.325 --> 00:21:57.005
We're stuck here.

275
00:21:58.765 --> 00:22:00.445
Is Jess okay?

276
00:22:00.525 --> 00:22:02.245
She's not talking.

277
00:22:03.005 --> 00:22:06.925
We're in a small town, Jess.
Nothing will happen to us here.

278
00:22:16.925 --> 00:22:17.965
Don't know what you want?

279
00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.685
Then just have the grilled cheese
plain with milk, okay?

280
00:22:19.765 --> 00:22:20.805
Come on, come over here.

281
00:22:20.885 --> 00:22:22.005
No, you know what?
Why don't you stay here?

282
00:22:22.085 --> 00:22:24.765
Stay here, all right?
You can see me from over there.

283
00:22:24.845 --> 00:22:25.885
What?
All right, you want to come with me?

284
00:22:25.965 --> 00:22:27.645
You can come with me and wait in line.
You want to do that?

285
00:22:27.725 --> 00:22:30.405
Bro! Bro, I got it.
Go get the milk.

286
00:22:30.485 --> 00:22:33.365
All right, yeah. Okay.

287
00:22:38.365 --> 00:22:41.245
You know that everyone
gives off energy, right?

288
00:22:41.325 --> 00:22:43.205
It's scientifically proven.

289
00:22:43.325 --> 00:22:45.365
They got these cameras
that can record what color you are

290
00:22:45.445 --> 00:22:47.245
when you're feeling different things.

291
00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:51.605
People that are angry give off a
different color than people that are sad.

292
00:22:51.685 --> 00:22:53.245
See this ring?

293
00:22:53.325 --> 00:22:57.085
This ring can supposedly tell you
what you're feeling.

294
00:22:57.165 --> 00:22:59.925
Let's see what
you're feeling right now.

295
00:23:04.045 --> 00:23:08.125
Yellow! That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.

296
00:23:08.845 --> 00:23:10.845
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.

297
00:23:10.925 --> 00:23:12.285
You must be about
to laugh or something.

298
00:23:12.365 --> 00:23:15.325
It's probably just
about to come out.

299
00:23:15.405 --> 00:23:16.805
We'll wait.

300
00:23:17.965 --> 00:23:19.565
We got all day.

301
00:23:22.805 --> 00:23:27.165
Oh, my God. There it is! Cool.
That ring really works. That's amazing.

302
00:23:27.245 --> 00:23:30.245
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

303
00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:32.405
My sister sent it to me.

304
00:23:32.485 --> 00:23:35.725
It was taken an hour ago
at the Philadelphia Zoo.

305
00:24:06.685 --> 00:24:09.965
Mother of God,
what kind of terrorists are these?

306
00:24:25.205 --> 00:24:27.605
They're not sure it's terrorists now.

307
00:24:27.685 --> 00:24:29.445
<i>Moments ago,
in an official statement,</i>

308
00:24:29.525 --> 00:24:31.885
<i>the government moved away
from its initial position</i>

309
00:24:31.965 --> 00:24:33.925
<i>that this was a
terrorist attack.</i>

310
00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:35.285
<i>Authorities are now feeling,</i>

311
00:24:35.365 --> 00:24:37.765
<i>by the sheer number
of incidents being reported,</i>

312
00:24:37.885 --> 00:24:42.725
<i>that a terrorist group being responsible
is becoming less and less likely.</i>

313
00:24:42.805 --> 00:24:45.365
<i>The event appears to be
limited to the Northeast,</i>

314
00:24:45.445 --> 00:24:48.445
<i>where smaller and smaller towns
are being attacked.</i>

315
00:24:48.525 --> 00:24:49.525
Where are we?

316
00:24:49.605 --> 00:24:51.445
<i>The infected area now
includes most of New England,</i>

317
00:24:51.525 --> 00:24:53.285
<i>from Massachusetts to Maryland.</i>

318
00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:54.605
We're dead center.

319
00:24:57.165 --> 00:24:58.765
Everything okay?

320
00:25:09.005 --> 00:25:12.765
If we stay here,
we are gonna die here.

321
00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:20.485
Whatever this is, it looks like it's
not occurring about 90 miles from here.

322
00:25:22.405 --> 00:25:23.685
Let's go.

323
00:25:27.005 --> 00:25:29.965
Anyone got a car?
Can anyone give us a ride?

324
00:25:42.725 --> 00:25:43.805
Hey!

325
00:25:52.365 --> 00:25:54.125
Excuse me, sir?

326
00:25:54.205 --> 00:25:55.485
Sir, could we get a ride, please?

327
00:25:55.565 --> 00:25:57.765
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.

328
00:25:57.845 --> 00:26:00.165
Sir, did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation!

329
00:26:00.245 --> 00:26:03.005
- We have a little girl with us. Please.
- Drive. Just roll up the window.

330
00:26:03.085 --> 00:26:05.805
Sir! You're not just going to...

331
00:26:10.045 --> 00:26:12.725
Can you believe
how crappy people are?

332
00:26:18.085 --> 00:26:19.365
There's a car.

333
00:26:20.765 --> 00:26:23.525
Hi. I run a plant
nursery up the street.

334
00:26:23.605 --> 00:26:26.405
We're picking up a few things from home,
then heading

335
00:26:27.365 --> 00:26:29.205
wherever this isn't happening.

336
00:26:29.285 --> 00:26:30.365
We have room.

337
00:26:30.445 --> 00:26:32.125
- We have two others.
- That's okay.

338
00:26:33.445 --> 00:26:34.805
Julian!

339
00:26:35.645 --> 00:26:37.245
Is Julian okay?

340
00:26:44.445 --> 00:26:47.485
We got a ride. He can fit all of us.

341
00:26:47.565 --> 00:26:51.325
Elliot, I can't get Evette on
the phone or e-mail or nothing.

342
00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:53.885
- How long?
- It's been about two hours.

343
00:26:53.965 --> 00:26:56.725
She was on that
bus headed to Princeton.

344
00:26:58.125 --> 00:27:00.005
There's a car over there headed
to pick up friends and family,

345
00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:02.765
they said they
could squeeze one more.

346
00:27:04.565 --> 00:27:06.085
We got to go.

347
00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.965
Look, think real carefully about this.

348
00:27:10.045 --> 00:27:11.805
She was looking
for a birthday present for Jess.

349
00:27:11.885 --> 00:27:15.405
Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.

350
00:27:15.485 --> 00:27:17.565
I'm just gonna go get her
and I want to bring her back,

351
00:27:17.645 --> 00:27:20.285
and then I'm gonna find you guys.

352
00:27:20.365 --> 00:27:22.925
I just...
I need you to take Jess, okay?

353
00:27:23.885 --> 00:27:26.405
She's gonna be
a lot safer with you.

354
00:27:26.765 --> 00:27:28.525
Don't do this to me.

355
00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:31.885
I'm doing my best
here not to fall down.

356
00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:36.445
I'm sure the probability of
Princeton not being hit is good.

357
00:27:36.525 --> 00:27:37.565
Yeah.

358
00:27:37.645 --> 00:27:39.405
You want me to throw some
figures and percentages at you

359
00:27:39.485 --> 00:27:40.565
so we both feel better?

360
00:27:40.645 --> 00:27:42.405
- Please.
- All right.

361
00:27:42.485 --> 00:27:46.405
62% chance.
62% chance it hasn't even been hit.

362
00:27:46.485 --> 00:27:48.525
- Well, you go get her, Jules, okay?
- Of course, man, of course.

363
00:27:48.605 --> 00:27:50.045
Come on.
This is all some weird event, that's all.

364
00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:53.925
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.

365
00:27:55.765 --> 00:27:57.245
I have to go.

366
00:27:58.285 --> 00:27:59.405
I got her, Julian.

367
00:27:59.485 --> 00:28:02.645
Don't take my daughter's hand
unless you mean it.

368
00:28:07.965 --> 00:28:10.045
I'm going to go get Mommy.

369
00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:12.765
Hold our picture.

370
00:29:05.165 --> 00:29:08.165
Take a look around.
We'll be ready in a jiffy.

371
00:29:24.325 --> 00:29:27.045
We're packing
hot dogs for the road.

372
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:29.525
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.

373
00:29:29.605 --> 00:29:32.245
They've got a cool shape,
they've got protein.

374
00:29:32.325 --> 00:29:34.285
You like hot dogs, right?

375
00:29:36.325 --> 00:29:39.485
By the way,
I think I know what's causing this.

376
00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:43.325
- You do?
- It's the plants.

377
00:29:43.405 --> 00:29:45.525
They can release chemicals.

378
00:29:47.445 --> 00:29:49.925
You like hot dogs, don't you?

379
00:29:53.245 --> 00:29:58.285
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going,
but we will be back soon, okay?

380
00:30:00.245 --> 00:30:04.085
Oh, plants react to human stimulus.
They've proved it in tests.

381
00:30:08.485 --> 00:30:10.285
Did you get the mustard?

382
00:30:52.885 --> 00:30:55.565
Don't look outside. Stop it!

383
00:30:55.645 --> 00:30:58.845
Stop it! Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!

384
00:31:01.805 --> 00:31:03.405
Close the vents.

385
00:31:08.565 --> 00:31:12.485
I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay?
And you're gonna tell me the answer.

386
00:31:12.565 --> 00:31:13.725
What?

387
00:31:15.325 --> 00:31:19.285
How much would you have if I said
I would pay you a penny on the first day

388
00:31:19.365 --> 00:31:21.925
and then two pennies on the second,
and then four pennies on the third day

389
00:31:22.005 --> 00:31:23.925
and I just kept doubling it
and I did this for a month?

390
00:31:24.005 --> 00:31:27.125
How much money would you have
at the end of the month?

391
00:31:28.085 --> 00:31:30.445
- Ten dollars.
- No, higher. Higher, higher.

392
00:31:30.525 --> 00:31:33.605
Just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.

393
00:31:35.445 --> 00:31:36.605
Twenty dollars?

394
00:31:36.685 --> 00:31:38.845
No, keep going. Keep going.

395
00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:50.805
Thirty. It's thirty. It's $30.

396
00:32:00.245 --> 00:32:02.725
I'm gonna tell you the answer.

397
00:32:02.805 --> 00:32:05.285
It's over $10 million.

398
00:32:05.365 --> 00:32:08.685
You'd have over $10 million
at the end of the month.

399
00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:15.005
You want to hear another one?

400
00:33:13.485 --> 00:33:16.445
<i>Water contamination has surfaced
as one of the many theories</i>

401
00:33:16.525 --> 00:33:21.205
<i>being taken seriously as to the cause
of the events in the Northeast.</i>

402
00:33:21.285 --> 00:33:23.325
We have to go through
this little community of homes.

403
00:33:23.405 --> 00:33:25.445
Small town called Holcomb,
then we hit the highway.

404
00:33:25.525 --> 00:33:28.685
From there,
we're 30 miles from the state line.

405
00:33:31.605 --> 00:33:34.005
Are those dead animals up ahead?

406
00:33:36.645 --> 00:33:38.085
Stop the car.

407
00:33:43.325 --> 00:33:45.925
- You don't think it's...
- I don't know.

408
00:33:46.005 --> 00:33:50.565
You got binoculars in the back, from
when you were spying on our neighbors.

409
00:34:01.405 --> 00:34:02.805
Can I have the map?

410
00:34:02.885 --> 00:34:04.605
Elliot...

411
00:34:04.685 --> 00:34:06.445
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.

412
00:34:06.525 --> 00:34:08.725
It's bodies, isn't it?
I knew it would be bodies.

413
00:34:08.805 --> 00:34:09.925
How could it not be bodies?

414
00:34:10.005 --> 00:34:12.125
Please, give me the map.

415
00:34:24.165 --> 00:34:25.525
Well, we have to turn around.

416
00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:27.445
There's a right turn
about a quarter of a mile back.

417
00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:30.885
We're just gonna take a different route,
honey, okay?

418
00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:52.645
Oh, it's the Army. We're safe!

419
00:35:01.085 --> 00:35:02.285
My name is Private Auster.

420
00:35:02.365 --> 00:35:05.885
I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base,
about 10 miles back.

421
00:35:05.965 --> 00:35:07.845
I think they've been affected
by whatever's happening.

422
00:35:07.965 --> 00:35:09.685
I lost communication with them.

423
00:35:09.765 --> 00:35:10.845
When I approached the base,

424
00:35:10.925 --> 00:35:16.325
I saw military personnel
in the barbed wire, in the fence.

425
00:35:16.405 --> 00:35:17.765
So I suggest no one take that road.

426
00:35:17.845 --> 00:35:19.445
There's a town
about eight miles behind us.

427
00:35:19.525 --> 00:35:22.285
There were bodies on the road into town.

428
00:35:24.245 --> 00:35:26.165
Cheese and crackers.

429
00:35:27.045 --> 00:35:29.925
Well, that still
leaves us two directions.

430
00:35:33.125 --> 00:35:36.085
Just stop! Stop the vehicle!

431
00:35:37.125 --> 00:35:38.805
- What's going on?
- Is everyone all right?

432
00:35:38.885 --> 00:35:40.605
We have no communication with anybody.

433
00:35:42.245 --> 00:35:44.525
- I'll talk to them.
- Did you see anything out of the ordinary?

434
00:35:46.285 --> 00:35:48.485
Hello! Please stop!

435
00:35:49.765 --> 00:35:51.085
Excuse me.

436
00:35:56.485 --> 00:35:57.805
Who's Joey?

437
00:35:57.965 --> 00:35:59.645
Oh, it's no one.

438
00:36:02.885 --> 00:36:04.485
Any luck?

439
00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:06.125
I can't get Julian
on his cell phone.

440
00:36:06.205 --> 00:36:09.245
I'm sure he'll be all right.
They'll be okay.

441
00:36:10.165 --> 00:36:13.165
Has anyone seen any other people
on the roads?

442
00:36:13.405 --> 00:36:15.565
Maybe he's on to something.

443
00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:20.325
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

444
00:36:20.405 --> 00:36:22.445
Why did it start in parks?

445
00:36:23.365 --> 00:36:25.645
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back.

446
00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:28.325
They say there's a bus in a lake.

447
00:36:30.485 --> 00:36:33.925
Five miles back.
There were dozens of bodies.

448
00:36:41.285 --> 00:36:42.685
Okay.

449
00:36:43.405 --> 00:36:48.045
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.

450
00:36:57.405 --> 00:36:59.045
There's a woman
talking to her daughter.

451
00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:00.565
She's talking to her
daughter in Princeton.

452
00:37:00.645 --> 00:37:02.765
Isn't that where your friend went?

453
00:37:02.845 --> 00:37:04.245
Come on.

454
00:37:09.445 --> 00:37:12.805
It's okay.
Honey, it's okay.

455
00:37:13.605 --> 00:37:14.765
She's so scared.

456
00:37:14.845 --> 00:37:19.845
You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.

457
00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:22.085
Just keep watching out the window
with the tree, baby.

458
00:37:22.165 --> 00:37:23.685
Someone will come and get you soon.

459
00:37:23.765 --> 00:37:26.925
Tell her not to go near the window
with the tree. Just tell her.

460
00:37:27.005 --> 00:37:28.845
Baby, don't go near the window
with the tree.

461
00:37:28.925 --> 00:37:30.485
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.

462
00:37:30.565 --> 00:37:34.725
Honey, someone wants to know
if Princeton's had any problems.

463
00:37:37.365 --> 00:37:39.925
She says everyone's dead outside.

464
00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:43.325
You just stay in your room.

465
00:37:44.405 --> 00:37:45.525
Honey?

466
00:37:46.685 --> 00:37:49.045
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?

467
00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:51.685
- What do you mean? Everyone's dead?
- What?

468
00:37:51.765 --> 00:37:55.165
Stacy... Stacy, you're scaring me.

469
00:37:55.245 --> 00:37:58.085
I don't understand what you're saying.

470
00:37:59.205 --> 00:38:00.325
What, baby?

471
00:38:00.405 --> 00:38:03.285
She's just not making any sense.

472
00:38:03.365 --> 00:38:04.805
<i>Calculus.</i>

473
00:38:04.885 --> 00:38:07.685
<i>I see in calculus.</i>

474
00:38:08.605 --> 00:38:10.045
<i>Calculus.</i>

475
00:38:10.125 --> 00:38:12.125
<i>- Stacy!
- Calculus.</i>

476
00:38:12.205 --> 00:38:13.685
Stacy!

477
00:38:15.645 --> 00:38:17.245
Stacy Ann!

478
00:38:17.765 --> 00:38:18.925
Oh, my God.

479
00:38:20.885 --> 00:38:24.965
- I hear wind from outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

480
00:38:25.045 --> 00:38:27.765
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.

481
00:38:30.405 --> 00:38:31.845
Oh, no!

482
00:38:46.165 --> 00:38:49.205
We're going to go back to the car,
okay, Jess?

483
00:38:54.365 --> 00:38:57.445
If we went down that road,
where would that take us?

484
00:39:51.445 --> 00:39:53.965
I walked down a quarter mile,
it was clean.

485
00:39:54.045 --> 00:39:57.845
I can't tell you what's after that,
but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing.

486
00:39:57.925 --> 00:40:00.445
- Quarter mile?
- That's not enough.

487
00:40:00.565 --> 00:40:03.325
Hey, it's better than going back
the other way.

488
00:40:03.765 --> 00:40:08.005
Get a battle plan.
Everybody makes a clean break.

489
00:40:08.085 --> 00:40:10.325
Elliot's resilient, isn't he?

490
00:40:12.725 --> 00:40:14.845
Yeah. He never gives up.

491
00:40:16.765 --> 00:40:20.085
You know, plants have the ability
to target specific threats.

492
00:40:20.165 --> 00:40:22.725
Tobacco plants,
when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars

493
00:40:22.805 --> 00:40:27.565
will send out a chemical attracting
wasps to kill just those caterpillars.

494
00:40:27.645 --> 00:40:29.245
We don't know how plants
attain these abilities.

495
00:40:29.365 --> 00:40:32.485
They just evolve very rapidly.

496
00:40:32.565 --> 00:40:36.605
Which species do you think is
doing it if you think it's true?

497
00:40:36.725 --> 00:40:39.845
Plants have the ability to communicate
with other species of plants.

498
00:40:39.925 --> 00:40:41.725
Trees can communicate with bushes,

499
00:40:41.845 --> 00:40:44.765
bushes with grass
and everything in between.

500
00:40:46.645 --> 00:40:50.245
The radio says these attacks
started happening in the cities

501
00:40:50.325 --> 00:40:52.805
then went to the towns
and now the roads.

502
00:40:52.885 --> 00:40:54.405
That's right.

503
00:40:54.485 --> 00:40:58.125
Whatever's happening is happening
to smaller and smaller populations.

504
00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:00.205
So we shouldn't be on the roads, then.

505
00:41:00.285 --> 00:41:04.165
The terrorists, or whatever
could be watching the roads.

506
00:41:07.285 --> 00:41:10.325
I don't have any reason
to disagree right now.

507
00:41:12.485 --> 00:41:14.445
We are in the area of attack.

508
00:41:14.525 --> 00:41:17.925
If you can't find a way
through the area of attack

509
00:41:18.005 --> 00:41:22.765
we are told to find a safe zone
within the area being attacked.

510
00:41:22.845 --> 00:41:25.325
They're attacking populations.

511
00:41:25.405 --> 00:41:28.005
We need to go where there
aren't that many people.

512
00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:30.125
Where people don't travel.

513
00:41:30.205 --> 00:41:34.605
Now this is Mr. Collins.
He's a realtor that works in this area.

514
00:41:36.245 --> 00:41:39.205
If we go west,
we'll hit a county called Arundell.

515
00:41:39.285 --> 00:41:40.765
It's not on that map.

516
00:41:40.885 --> 00:41:45.485
It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads.
Hardly anybody lives out there.

517
00:41:46.325 --> 00:41:50.325
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.

518
00:41:50.405 --> 00:41:54.885
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?

519
00:41:57.525 --> 00:41:59.125
We should go into two groups.

520
00:41:59.205 --> 00:42:00.805
Those that are
ready to go right now

521
00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:03.205
and those that need
to get things from their cars.

522
00:42:03.285 --> 00:42:06.645
We need to stay in groups.
Stay together.

523
00:42:09.525 --> 00:42:11.925
We'll go soon, honey.
We'll go soon.

524
00:42:16.085 --> 00:42:17.325
Maybe we should've waited
for the rest of them,

525
00:42:17.405 --> 00:42:20.445
stayed in a big group,
like the Private said.

526
00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:22.965
Your phone's out, too?

527
00:42:26.245 --> 00:42:27.685
What's wrong?

528
00:42:29.125 --> 00:42:31.325
Okay. I was going to tell you, okay?

529
00:42:31.445 --> 00:42:33.645
There was this guy, Joey.

530
00:42:33.725 --> 00:42:35.045
His name is Joey.
He's at work.

531
00:42:35.125 --> 00:42:36.685
We went out and we had dessert.

532
00:42:36.765 --> 00:42:39.445
I went out and I had dessert with him
when I told you I worked late.

533
00:42:39.525 --> 00:42:40.725
And I didn't work late.

534
00:42:40.805 --> 00:42:42.565
I'm feeling really guilty
in case we're gonna die.

535
00:42:42.645 --> 00:42:44.925
I just wanted you to know that.

536
00:42:46.725 --> 00:42:48.245
You lied to me?

537
00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:01.285
- How much farther is it?
- I don't know.

538
00:43:12.285 --> 00:43:14.365
- We need to keep going forward.
- Who the hell made you boss?

539
00:43:14.485 --> 00:43:18.125
Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die.
You follow me, you're gonna live.

540
00:43:18.205 --> 00:43:22.125
I'm in charge of this group!
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group!

541
00:43:22.205 --> 00:43:26.525
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!

542
00:43:27.485 --> 00:43:29.085
Private Auster?

543
00:43:32.245 --> 00:43:34.445
My firearm is my friend.

544
00:44:09.685 --> 00:44:10.925
Jesus.

545
00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:16.605
Oh, no.

546
00:44:16.725 --> 00:44:18.165
What, "Oh, no"?

547
00:44:22.005 --> 00:44:23.405
The toxin?

548
00:44:26.365 --> 00:44:28.645
The toxin is affecting them?

549
00:44:28.725 --> 00:44:30.685
Are those people killing themselves?

550
00:44:30.805 --> 00:44:32.445
You were with the Private.
What do we do?

551
00:44:32.565 --> 00:44:35.525
- We need to do something!
- Just let me think.

552
00:44:37.525 --> 00:44:39.165
- They're dying!
- I need a second.

553
00:44:39.285 --> 00:44:41.725
They released it?
We're not near the roads.

554
00:44:41.845 --> 00:44:44.125
We can't just stand here
as uninvolved observers!

555
00:44:44.245 --> 00:44:45.525
I need a second, okay.
Just give me a second!

556
00:44:45.605 --> 00:44:47.765
We are not going to be
one of those assholes on the news

557
00:44:47.845 --> 00:44:49.645
who watches a crime happen
and not do something!

558
00:44:49.725 --> 00:44:51.525
- We're not assholes!
- Just a second!

559
00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:52.765
There were children in that group!

560
00:44:52.885 --> 00:44:55.485
- Elliot, please tell us what to do.
- I need a second, okay!

561
00:44:55.605 --> 00:44:58.685
Why can't anybody
give me a goddamn second?

562
00:44:58.805 --> 00:45:00.285
All right, be scientific, douchebag.

563
00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:03.205
Identify the variables.
That's the two groups.

564
00:45:03.285 --> 00:45:06.205
Design an experiment.
That's what we're in.

565
00:45:06.325 --> 00:45:09.125
Careful observation and measurements.
That's what I'm trying to do.

566
00:45:09.205 --> 00:45:12.085
Interpret the experimental data.
Interpret.

567
00:45:14.485 --> 00:45:16.485
What if it is the plants?

568
00:45:17.565 --> 00:45:19.925
Their group was larger than ours.

569
00:45:20.005 --> 00:45:21.925
This thing has been escalating all day.

570
00:45:22.005 --> 00:45:24.685
Smaller and smaller populations
have been setting this off.

571
00:45:24.765 --> 00:45:27.005
They react to human stimulus.

572
00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:30.125
Maybe people are
setting off the plants?

573
00:45:30.205 --> 00:45:32.605
What are you saying? That guy was crazy.
We have to save them.

574
00:45:32.725 --> 00:45:34.845
They're already dead.

575
00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:37.365
What if they're
targeting us as threats?

576
00:45:37.445 --> 00:45:41.405
This part of the field
may not have been set off.

577
00:45:41.525 --> 00:45:44.165
Something in this field could be
releasing the chemical into the air

578
00:45:44.245 --> 00:45:47.045
when there's too
many of us together.

579
00:45:48.725 --> 00:45:51.125
Let's just stay
ahead of the wind.

580
00:46:06.885 --> 00:46:09.245
Let's just break up into groups.

581
00:46:17.845 --> 00:46:21.845
Come on! Come on! This way!
Come on, follow me!

582
00:46:24.565 --> 00:46:28.445
I'm right here! Keep going!
I'm right behind you!

583
00:46:36.725 --> 00:46:38.285
Here it comes!

584
00:46:39.965 --> 00:46:42.205
Don't you let go of my hand.

585
00:47:32.245 --> 00:47:34.205
Nothing happened.

586
00:47:34.325 --> 00:47:37.005
It's the size of the groups,
I think.

587
00:47:37.245 --> 00:47:39.125
Could this really be happening?

588
00:47:42.845 --> 00:47:44.165
What are your names?

589
00:47:44.245 --> 00:47:46.725
- Jared.
- Josh.

590
00:47:46.805 --> 00:47:48.205
Wait, wait!

591
00:48:02.685 --> 00:48:06.485
I'm going to go see if that truck
has a map. You guys wait here.

592
00:48:31.205 --> 00:48:33.605
<i>Why aren't they looking
into nuclear power plants?</i>

593
00:48:33.685 --> 00:48:35.965
<i>There are 15 or more
in the Northeast alone.</i>

594
00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:38.325
<i>More than anywhere else
in the United States.</i>

595
00:48:38.405 --> 00:48:40.845
<i>There's probably been
some leak or something.</i>

596
00:48:40.925 --> 00:48:43.245
<i>It's probably poisoning the air.</i>

597
00:48:50.725 --> 00:48:53.325
There's a house over there! Come on!

598
00:48:56.725 --> 00:48:58.165
It could have been
some terrorist booby-trap,

599
00:48:58.245 --> 00:48:59.965
someone stepped on
it out in the field.

600
00:49:00.085 --> 00:49:02.005
Yeah, in a field
in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania.

601
00:49:02.085 --> 00:49:03.645
I don't know.

602
00:49:04.885 --> 00:49:08.605
Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent in a certain density.

603
00:49:08.725 --> 00:49:12.125
The source had to be close to that field,
if not in the field.

604
00:49:12.245 --> 00:49:13.685
Here's one.

605
00:49:14.325 --> 00:49:19.805
Plants have the chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.

606
00:49:20.005 --> 00:49:21.965
You think it could be plants?

607
00:49:22.045 --> 00:49:23.565
I don't know.

608
00:49:23.965 --> 00:49:26.605
But if it is, and people are
setting it off in groups,

609
00:49:26.685 --> 00:49:29.725
we need to go to the least
populated place we can to be safe.

610
00:49:29.845 --> 00:49:33.005
We can't walk to the borders where this
isn't happening, Alma. It's too far.

611
00:49:33.085 --> 00:49:37.245
Whatever it is, terrorists,
a nuclear leak, plants,

612
00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:40.605
it's probably safe to get
away from people right now.

613
00:49:40.725 --> 00:49:43.325
That must be Arundell.
It's 10 miles from here.

614
00:49:43.445 --> 00:49:46.525
Okay, this place must have a bathroom.
I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave.

615
00:49:46.645 --> 00:49:47.925
Hurry.

616
00:50:02.845 --> 00:50:04.085
Hello?

617
00:50:05.045 --> 00:50:06.925
My name is Elliot Moore.

618
00:50:08.565 --> 00:50:11.285
I'm just going to talk
in a very positive manner.

619
00:50:11.365 --> 00:50:14.045
Giving off good vibes.

620
00:50:14.165 --> 00:50:18.765
We're just here to use the bathroom
and then we're just gonna leave.

621
00:50:18.845 --> 00:50:20.685
I hope that's okay.

622
00:50:29.045 --> 00:50:30.285
Plastic.

623
00:50:31.125 --> 00:50:33.525
I'm talking to a plastic plant.

624
00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:36.725
I'm still doing it.

625
00:50:40.285 --> 00:50:42.125
You guys ready to leave?

626
00:50:42.205 --> 00:50:46.045
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving the front door unlocked?

627
00:50:46.165 --> 00:50:48.045
Hey, everything's fake.

628
00:51:07.285 --> 00:51:09.405
Why is this happening?

629
00:51:09.525 --> 00:51:11.485
I don't know for sure, Josh.

630
00:51:11.605 --> 00:51:14.285
But I read this article
about the coast of Australia.

631
00:51:14.365 --> 00:51:17.885
It said they found large quantities
of a primordial bacteria.

632
00:51:18.005 --> 00:51:21.165
It hadn't been around for billions
of years, it just appeared in the water.

633
00:51:21.245 --> 00:51:24.845
It's toxic to humans, fishermen
who come in contact with it are dying.

634
00:51:24.925 --> 00:51:26.165
It feels kind of similar to that.

635
00:51:26.245 --> 00:51:30.325
With the bees disappearing, I mean,
I don't know, it feels like a pattern.

636
00:51:31.125 --> 00:51:32.685
The nature of events
like the one in Australia

637
00:51:32.765 --> 00:51:35.325
is that they crest and then stop.

638
00:51:35.445 --> 00:51:38.445
We just have to be
alive when it's over.

639
00:51:38.525 --> 00:51:41.165
I don't believe it's nature.

640
00:51:41.245 --> 00:51:45.365
It may not be. There could be some
other explanation. I don't know.

641
00:51:47.205 --> 00:51:48.605
Let's go.

642
00:51:49.245 --> 00:51:50.685
There are people coming!

643
00:51:50.805 --> 00:51:54.565
We can't stay here. It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.

644
00:52:09.685 --> 00:52:12.205
There's two groups coming together.

645
00:52:13.365 --> 00:52:15.845
There's too many of them together.

646
00:52:16.885 --> 00:52:18.485
Run. Run.

647
00:53:01.245 --> 00:53:03.365
- Is she your kid?
- No.

648
00:53:03.445 --> 00:53:05.485
- You got kids?
- No.

649
00:53:05.565 --> 00:53:07.205
How come? You got a problem?

650
00:53:07.285 --> 00:53:10.045
No. She wanted to wait.

651
00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:11.725
Really? For what?

652
00:53:11.805 --> 00:53:14.805
Me to grow up.
Why are we talking about this?

653
00:53:17.205 --> 00:53:20.125
Sweet. I used to love those.
Can I see it?

654
00:53:21.845 --> 00:53:25.565
You need to take personal responsibility
for yourself in a relationship.

655
00:53:25.685 --> 00:53:28.125
- That'll make a difference.
- Okay. Thank you.

656
00:53:28.245 --> 00:53:31.205
Hey, that's not a toy.
It's got meaning to me.

657
00:53:32.725 --> 00:53:35.645
- Elliot! Look!
- Come on.

658
00:53:38.725 --> 00:53:39.725
Oh, wow.

659
00:53:45.845 --> 00:53:47.445
<i>... is an emergency broadcast.</i>

660
00:53:47.525 --> 00:53:50.965
<i>All those who are still inside
the affected area of the Northeast</i>

661
00:53:51.045 --> 00:53:54.925
<i>are asked to proceed to the police
borders west of your state.</i>

662
00:53:55.605 --> 00:53:56.605
Come on.

663
00:53:56.725 --> 00:53:58.925
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

664
00:54:00.405 --> 00:54:02.645
<i>... inside the affected area...</i>

665
00:54:09.365 --> 00:54:12.285
Jess needs a 10-minute rest
and some food.

666
00:54:19.445 --> 00:54:21.645
Are you sure?
We should keep going.

667
00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:24.445
I know, but she's only eight.

668
00:54:27.005 --> 00:54:28.565
What?

669
00:54:28.645 --> 00:54:31.165
If we're going to die,
I want you to know something.

670
00:54:31.285 --> 00:54:33.245
I was in the pharmacy a while ago,

671
00:54:33.365 --> 00:54:36.205
and there was a really good-looking
pharmacist behind the counter.

672
00:54:36.285 --> 00:54:37.805
Really good-looking.

673
00:54:37.885 --> 00:54:40.285
And I went up and I asked her
where the cough syrup was.

674
00:54:40.365 --> 00:54:42.525
I didn't even have a cough.

675
00:54:42.645 --> 00:54:44.685
And I almost bought it.

676
00:54:44.765 --> 00:54:48.205
And I'm talking about a completely
superfluous bottle of cough syrup.

677
00:54:48.285 --> 00:54:50.445
That's like six bucks.

678
00:54:51.925 --> 00:54:53.525
Are you joking?

679
00:55:00.405 --> 00:55:01.805
Thank you.

680
00:55:31.605 --> 00:55:35.405
- Maybe that's not a good idea.
- I told her just for a minute.

681
00:55:40.965 --> 00:55:42.645
Mr. Moore,
I think I can open this door.

682
00:55:42.725 --> 00:55:45.285
Wait. We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?

683
00:55:45.365 --> 00:55:47.125
- Come on, guys.
- Listen, nobody's home.

684
00:55:47.205 --> 00:55:48.765
We're just gonna
get some food for Jess.

685
00:55:48.885 --> 00:55:51.205
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's
lived here for a long time anyway.

686
00:55:51.285 --> 00:55:53.085
I mean, it's all boarded up.

687
00:55:53.205 --> 00:55:55.525
Maybe we could leave some money.

688
00:55:58.805 --> 00:56:02.645
- What kind of tree is this?
- I think it's a maple.

689
00:56:03.605 --> 00:56:05.405
Not so high.

690
00:56:05.525 --> 00:56:07.885
Okay, Josh, open the door.

691
00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:09.925
Wait!

692
00:56:10.805 --> 00:56:13.045
I see something.

693
00:56:13.125 --> 00:56:14.885
- There's somebody in there!
- You sure?

694
00:56:14.965 --> 00:56:16.765
Yeah, I saw him move.

695
00:56:18.165 --> 00:56:19.605
I see him!

696
00:56:21.205 --> 00:56:22.605
Let's stop.

697
00:56:25.405 --> 00:56:29.085
Is there any way we could get some food?
We have a little girl.

698
00:56:29.205 --> 00:56:31.565
- We just want to get her some food.
- You best leave now.

699
00:56:31.645 --> 00:56:33.525
You ain't gonna bring that
poison gas in here with you.

700
00:56:33.605 --> 00:56:36.285
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.

701
00:56:36.405 --> 00:56:39.485
- They said to stay inside.
- We're fine right now.

702
00:56:39.565 --> 00:56:41.485
Nothing's happened out here yet.

703
00:56:41.565 --> 00:56:44.645
I mean, you can see that.
Just listen to our voices.

704
00:56:44.725 --> 00:56:46.645
We're perfectly normal.

705
00:56:47.845 --> 00:56:50.005
<i>Old black water,
keep on rolling</i>

706
00:56:50.085 --> 00:56:53.445
<i>Mississippi moon
Won't you keep on shining on me?</i>

707
00:56:53.685 --> 00:56:55.485
See? We're normal.

708
00:56:58.325 --> 00:57:01.445
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.

709
00:57:01.525 --> 00:57:03.525
Okay. It's not worth it.

710
00:57:04.405 --> 00:57:05.685
Open the door, bitch!

711
00:57:05.765 --> 00:57:09.205
Hey, Josh, don't do that.
He didn't mean that!

712
00:57:09.285 --> 00:57:13.205
- There's more than one in there.
- Jess! Jess, come here.

713
00:57:13.285 --> 00:57:16.885
Stop it, Jess. Listen, we just want some
food for a little girl, you pussies!

714
00:57:16.965 --> 00:57:19.285
- Jess, come here.
- Josh, stop it.

715
00:57:20.845 --> 00:57:22.325
You'd best not let that gas in here.

716
00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:25.485
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.

717
00:57:25.565 --> 00:57:30.085
- You might be with the terrorists!
- I don't think it's terrorists, sir.

718
00:57:30.165 --> 00:57:33.005
- Josh, stop it!
- They're being crazy, Mr. Moore!

719
00:57:33.085 --> 00:57:35.125
- Show your faces!
- Let the gas in...

720
00:57:35.205 --> 00:57:36.605
No!

721
00:57:50.325 --> 00:57:52.285
Jared!

722
00:58:07.325 --> 00:58:10.045
We're gonna get
out of this nightmare.

723
00:58:17.725 --> 00:58:19.125
Elliot!

724
00:58:24.165 --> 00:58:27.765
We have to go.
We have to protect Jess.

725
00:58:28.405 --> 00:58:29.525
Okay?

726
00:58:33.965 --> 00:58:36.805
You've got to three
to get off our porch!

727
00:58:43.205 --> 00:58:44.645
Come here.

728
00:58:48.245 --> 00:58:51.485
<i>No new people have crossed
over the border for a few hours.</i>

729
00:58:51.605 --> 00:58:55.285
<i>It appears those residents that are still
in the affected area of the Northeast</i>

730
00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:56.605
<i>are trying to wait it out.</i>

731
00:58:56.685 --> 00:58:58.925
<i>We have Professor Kendel Wallace
of Carnegie Mellon,</i>

732
00:58:58.965 --> 00:59:01.965
<i>a statistician, here with us.
Professor, what can you tell us?</i>

733
00:59:02.165 --> 00:59:05.445
<i>Calculating by the rise in
intensity of reports of incidents</i>

734
00:59:05.485 --> 00:59:10.045
<i>within the affected area,
one can guess at a crude timetable.</i>

735
00:59:10.125 --> 00:59:13.445
<i>One can see the incident
is rising in sensitivity.</i>

736
00:59:13.725 --> 00:59:17.165
<i>We've seen fewer and fewer people
can provoke the attacks.</i>

737
00:59:17.725 --> 00:59:21.645
<i>The event should be at its most
sensitive tomorrow morning.</i>

738
00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:25.405
<i>Typically, these type of slopes
drop precipitously after cresting,</i>

739
00:59:25.485 --> 00:59:29.565
<i>meaning it could end suddenly,
at any moment.</i>

740
00:59:29.645 --> 00:59:32.285
<i>Of course,
these are only probabilities.</i>

741
00:59:32.365 --> 00:59:33.605
<i>There are some quiet rumblings</i>

742
00:59:33.685 --> 00:59:36.245
<i>that the government may be
involved in the tragic events</i>

743
00:59:36.325 --> 00:59:39.565
<i>playing out in the Northeast.
Now, these rumors have been fuelled</i>

744
00:59:39.605 --> 00:59:42.325
<i>by the statements
of a confidential informant</i>

745
00:59:42.405 --> 00:59:46.165
<i>who claims that the CIA
has facilities in the Northeast,</i>

746
00:59:46.245 --> 00:59:50.165
<i>where they are testing drugs with
some similar psychotropic properties</i>

747
00:59:50.245 --> 00:59:52.845
<i>as a defense against
chemical weapons.</i>

748
00:59:52.925 --> 00:59:54.645
<i>CIA and White House officials</i>

749
00:59:54.725 --> 00:59:57.605
<i>have declined to respond
to these accusations.</i>

750
00:59:57.685 --> 01:00:00.845
<i>Perimeters have been set up
all along the East Coast</i>

751
01:00:00.925 --> 01:00:03.765
<i>from Maryland
all the way to Massachusetts.</i>

752
01:00:14.765 --> 01:00:17.805
This house has no power going to it.

753
01:00:17.885 --> 01:00:20.925
Nobody's driven on this driveway
for a long time, either.

754
01:00:21.045 --> 01:00:23.525
Let me go. You guys stay right here.

755
01:00:52.725 --> 01:00:54.485
That's for Clement.

756
01:00:58.525 --> 01:01:00.165
He's a retriever.

757
01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.685
You lost?

758
01:01:06.325 --> 01:01:08.165
You must be.

759
01:01:08.245 --> 01:01:11.125
There ain't nothing
around here for miles.

760
01:01:13.685 --> 01:01:16.085
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?

761
01:01:20.245 --> 01:01:24.325
I suppose the kind thing for me
to do is to offer you supper.

762
01:01:33.325 --> 01:01:35.485
I ain't gonna ask you again.

763
01:01:52.365 --> 01:01:54.645
I hope the meal was sufficient.

764
01:01:56.365 --> 01:01:58.525
I wasn't expecting guests.

765
01:02:03.245 --> 01:02:05.485
This is a beautiful place.

766
01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:10.245
There's a springhouse in the back.

767
01:02:11.885 --> 01:02:15.365
They used to hide people
from slave chasers back there.

768
01:02:17.325 --> 01:02:21.845
It has a speaking tube running
under the ground to the main house.

769
01:02:23.805 --> 01:02:27.285
You can hear each other
like you were in the same room.

770
01:02:32.045 --> 01:02:34.045
So, what's with you two?

771
01:02:35.965 --> 01:02:37.645
Who's chasing who?

772
01:02:38.365 --> 01:02:39.765
I'm sorry?

773
01:02:41.245 --> 01:02:45.685
Ain't no time two people staring
at each other, standing still,

774
01:02:45.765 --> 01:02:48.965
love in both their eyes,
at the same time, equal.

775
01:02:50.685 --> 01:02:53.885
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.

776
01:02:55.285 --> 01:02:57.365
That's the way we's built.

777
01:02:59.045 --> 01:03:00.205
So?

778
01:03:01.205 --> 01:03:02.765
Who's chasing?

779
01:03:05.765 --> 01:03:07.885
I knew that. I knew that.

780
01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.725
Don't touch things that aren't yours.

781
01:03:25.045 --> 01:03:27.405
- Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
- No.

782
01:03:27.485 --> 01:03:30.325
I got enough to fill my time right here.

783
01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:34.205
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.

784
01:03:36.285 --> 01:03:38.605
Although I ain't got the touch.

785
01:03:40.125 --> 01:03:43.405
Gardens don't grow the way they should.
Never have.

786
01:03:44.725 --> 01:03:49.245
- How do you stay in contact with others?
- I don't.

787
01:03:50.325 --> 01:03:53.005
How would you know if something
were to happen? Like a world event?

788
01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:56.965
Mrs. Jones, something's happened
along the East Coast.

789
01:03:57.045 --> 01:03:58.925
Whatever it is that
you think is so important

790
01:03:59.005 --> 01:04:01.325
that you need to tell me, don't.

791
01:04:03.405 --> 01:04:05.405
Just keep it to yourself.

792
01:04:06.405 --> 01:04:09.845
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.

793
01:04:14.525 --> 01:04:17.445
Suppose I have to
let you spend the night.

794
01:04:18.685 --> 01:04:21.285
Guest room's up on the left.

795
01:04:21.365 --> 01:04:22.885
Mind the steps.

796
01:04:45.445 --> 01:04:47.805
I'm scared, Elliot.

797
01:04:47.925 --> 01:04:49.325
It's okay.

798
01:04:51.485 --> 01:04:56.045
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. I was being stupid.

799
01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:58.805
You've been great taking care of Jess.

800
01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.645
I don't like this woman.

801
01:05:03.725 --> 01:05:08.365
<i>There's something Exorcist-y about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?</i>

802
01:05:09.645 --> 01:05:11.925
Well, we need to stay in this house.

803
01:05:12.005 --> 01:05:14.605
You want me to protect you,
this is how we have to do it.

804
01:05:14.685 --> 01:05:16.725
Let's just deal with her.

805
01:05:33.725 --> 01:05:35.565
I hear you whispering.

806
01:05:36.485 --> 01:05:39.005
Planning on stealing something?

807
01:05:39.085 --> 01:05:40.805
No, ma'am, we're not.

808
01:05:40.885 --> 01:05:43.445
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?

809
01:05:43.525 --> 01:05:45.205
What? No!

810
01:07:15.845 --> 01:07:17.285
Mrs. Jones?

811
01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.565
Mrs. Jones?

812
01:07:44.285 --> 01:07:45.485
Crazy lady.

813
01:07:45.685 --> 01:07:47.485
You trying to steal my things?

814
01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:50.605
No! No, Mrs. Jones,
I actually wanted to talk with you.

815
01:07:50.685 --> 01:07:55.005
- You all are gonna leave right now!
- Ma'am, you don't understand.

816
01:07:55.085 --> 01:07:57.725
There's something happening
in a few states, in this region.

817
01:07:57.805 --> 01:08:00.165
- It's not safe!
- Leave now!

818
01:08:16.685 --> 01:08:18.965
The Lord is my shepherd.

819
01:08:19.045 --> 01:08:23.925
The Lord is my shepherd.

820
01:08:24.885 --> 01:08:27.605
Mrs. Jones,
could we talk calmly for a second?

821
01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:30.885
Just hear me out.
See, I'm a teacher...

822
01:08:46.485 --> 01:08:48.085
Mrs. Jones?

823
01:08:52.125 --> 01:08:53.485
Oh, my God.

824
01:09:00.125 --> 01:09:02.725
Alma, shut the windows
and the doors!

825
01:09:07.045 --> 01:09:08.485
Alma?

826
01:09:14.045 --> 01:09:15.485
Alma?

827
01:10:34.045 --> 01:10:35.445
Alma?

828
01:10:37.085 --> 01:10:38.325
Jess?

829
01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:45.165
Hi, froggie! Hi, froggie!

830
01:11:05.245 --> 01:11:06.805
Okay, yeah. Wait.

831
01:11:08.565 --> 01:11:12.565
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby? I think he's a baby.

832
01:11:13.805 --> 01:11:17.205
He's so tiny.
I didn't know frogs could be like that.

833
01:11:17.285 --> 01:11:19.525
Oh, he got water on my shoe.

834
01:11:22.205 --> 01:11:23.445
Isn't this a cool house?

835
01:11:23.525 --> 01:11:27.085
If we had this house,
we could make it look so pretty.

836
01:11:29.885 --> 01:11:33.605
Get him again. Get him again.
Hey, froggie.

837
01:11:33.685 --> 01:11:35.085
Alma?

838
01:11:36.005 --> 01:11:39.245
Good morning, Elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.

839
01:11:39.325 --> 01:11:42.285
- Close the windows and the doors, Alma.
- Why?

840
01:11:43.045 --> 01:11:46.325
Mrs. Jones just died.
Close the windows.

841
01:11:49.125 --> 01:11:50.965
Close the door, Jess!

842
01:12:13.165 --> 01:12:15.245
- Is everything closed?
- Yes.

843
01:12:27.525 --> 01:12:31.525
- I'm sorry, Alma.
- What's going on, Elliot?

844
01:12:32.445 --> 01:12:34.125
It's happening here.

845
01:12:34.205 --> 01:12:37.125
It could be the grass and
the trees are doing this now.

846
01:12:37.205 --> 01:12:40.005
She was alone when it happened.

847
01:12:40.085 --> 01:12:43.245
Seems like they might have
gotten more sensitive.

848
01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:47.445
It's too dangerous
to go outside, isn't it?

849
01:12:47.525 --> 01:12:48.925
Yes.

850
01:12:51.685 --> 01:12:53.725
This is the end, isn't it?

851
01:12:55.885 --> 01:12:57.685
I wish you were here.

852
01:12:58.645 --> 01:13:00.085
Me, too.

853
01:13:14.325 --> 01:13:16.125
You remember our first date?

854
01:13:17.445 --> 01:13:18.845
You were so quiet.

855
01:13:18.925 --> 01:13:21.165
You bought me the mood ring.

856
01:13:23.925 --> 01:13:26.405
It turned purple when you wore it.

857
01:13:27.645 --> 01:13:30.805
Then you said,
"That means you're in love."

858
01:13:33.165 --> 01:13:35.525
It got you to talk, didn't it?

859
01:13:44.325 --> 01:13:46.285
Then we checked
the little paper chart,

860
01:13:46.365 --> 01:13:49.485
and it turned out that
purple meant I was horny.

861
01:13:50.445 --> 01:13:52.925
- You loved that.
- I had no idea.

862
01:13:55.285 --> 01:13:58.605
Yours was blue.
Peaceful, right?

863
01:13:59.645 --> 01:14:01.085
Right.

864
01:14:02.725 --> 01:14:04.485
What color was love?

865
01:14:09.165 --> 01:14:11.285
I don't remember.

866
01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:12.765
Me, neither.

867
01:14:20.925 --> 01:14:22.685
Elliot?

868
01:14:22.765 --> 01:14:23.845
Yeah?

869
01:14:24.845 --> 01:14:26.605
I was just making
sure you're there.

870
01:14:34.085 --> 01:14:36.845
It's not right for it to end like this.

871
01:14:36.925 --> 01:14:39.245
If we're gonna die,
I want to be with you.

872
01:14:39.325 --> 01:14:43.045
I want to be with you,
and I'm gonna come and be with you.

873
01:14:46.925 --> 01:14:48.485
Elliot, don't!

874
01:17:10.165 --> 01:17:13.445
<i>The event must have ended
before we went out there.</i>

875
01:17:22.445 --> 01:17:24.285
I found the hair clip!

876
01:17:28.325 --> 01:17:32.125
You don't want to be late
for the first day schools are open.

877
01:17:32.925 --> 01:17:34.365
Oh, wait.

878
01:17:36.885 --> 01:17:39.365
I'm just gonna put this right here.

879
01:17:40.725 --> 01:17:42.125
Okay?

880
01:17:46.565 --> 01:17:50.365
- Are you okay?
- Yes, Aunt Alma. I love you.

881
01:17:51.645 --> 01:17:53.805
I love you, too. Come here.

882
01:18:04.325 --> 01:18:08.245
All right. I'll pick you up
after you're done with school, okay?

883
01:18:19.005 --> 01:18:20.405
Bye.

884
01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:27.605
<i>As everyone knows by now,</i>

885
01:18:27.685 --> 01:18:30.925
<i>traces of the neurotoxin have been
found in some plants and trees.</i>

886
01:18:31.005 --> 01:18:32.325
<i>Now, most environmentalists feel</i>

887
01:18:32.405 --> 01:18:36.165
<i>that this event is like
the red tide in the ocean,</i>

888
01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:40.485
<i>but instead of algae killing fish,
this happened on land.</i>

889
01:18:40.565 --> 01:18:42.085
<i>Now, plants and trees
just can't pick up and move</i>

890
01:18:42.165 --> 01:18:43.805
<i>when they feel threatened,
like other species.</i>

891
01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:47.845
<i>They have only one option,
to rapidly evolve their chemistry.</i>

892
01:18:47.965 --> 01:18:49.405
<i>Well.</i>

893
01:18:49.485 --> 01:18:54.165
<i>Kay from Mississippi wants to know
why it started so suddenly,</i>

894
01:18:54.245 --> 01:18:59.285
<i>on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended
so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning.</i>

895
01:18:59.365 --> 01:19:04.365
<i>Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest,
this was an act of nature,</i>

896
01:19:04.445 --> 01:19:06.805
<i>and we'll never fully understand it.</i>

897
01:19:06.885 --> 01:19:10.365
<i>And, Doctor, there's been
a lot of speculation</i>

898
01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:13.485
<i>as to why this happened
in the Northeast only.</i>

899
01:19:14.085 --> 01:19:15.165
<i>How do you explain that?</i>

900
01:19:15.245 --> 01:19:17.685
<i>Well, I believe, all right,
and this is just my opinion,</i>

901
01:19:17.765 --> 01:19:19.445
<i>that this was a prelude, okay?</i>

902
01:19:19.525 --> 01:19:22.685
<i>A warning,
like the first spot of a rash.</i>

903
01:19:22.765 --> 01:19:24.805
<i>We have become
a threat to this planet.</i>

904
01:19:24.925 --> 01:19:26.845
<i>I don't think anybody
will argue that.</i>

905
01:19:26.925 --> 01:19:28.805
<i>- And this is a warning.
- A warning?</i>

906
01:19:28.885 --> 01:19:32.445
<i>I think the skeptics would believe that
if it had occurred anywhere else.</i>

907
01:19:32.525 --> 01:19:35.005
<i>That's why most people
believe it was the government.</i>

908
01:19:35.085 --> 01:19:38.965
<i>If it had happened in one other place,
anywhere else,</i>

909
01:19:39.045 --> 01:19:40.285
<i>we could all believe
what you're saying.</i>

910
01:21:13.525 --> 01:21:16.605
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

911
01:21:16.885 --> 01:21:18.845
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?

912
01:21:20.685 --> 01:21:23.805
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

913
01:21:30.205 --> 01:21:32.165
That frightened me.

914
01:21:35.965 --> 01:21:37.725
I should drop my bicycle off

915
01:21:37.885 --> 01:21:38.885
What?

916
01:21:48.765 --> 01:21:50.485
My God...

917
01:21:51.325 --> 01:21:53.325
My
bicycle.

918
01:24:45.725 --> 01:24:46.685
