1
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.785
He's in.

2
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.561
He's uploading.

3
00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:22.463
If he logs out

4
00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:24.799
we can kiss the max
sentence goodbye.

5
00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:28.422
It's messed up world, man.

6
00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:30.191
You know, I've been
to a lot

7
00:11:30.224 --> 00:11:31.425
of murder scenes.

8
00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:35.729
This shit's different.

9
00:11:37.898 --> 00:11:39.800
Like, as soon as
I lay down

10
00:11:41.802 --> 00:11:43.737
all I see are
those kids faces.

11
00:11:53.247 --> 00:11:55.416
I don't think I can do
this job. Tim.

12
00:11:56.685 --> 00:11:57.718
Let me ask you something.

13
00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:00.387
How many pedophiles,
you caught?

14
00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:02.389
as of today,

15
00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.392
288, not so bad.

16
00:12:06.727 --> 00:12:08.862
How many kids you found?

17
00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:13.434
It is a high probability

18
00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:16.904
that most of those kids are
outside of the US, Chris.

19
00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:20.241
So our job,

20
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:22.810
is to get the pedophiles.

21
00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:24.945
And that's it?

22
00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:30.417
It's a messed up world, right

23
00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:06.380
Hello, Mr.
Oshinsky

24
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.152
I'm Agent Ballard.

25
00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:14.522
I'm in charge of your case.

26
00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:20.528
Everybody's gone home
for the weekend,

27
00:14:20.894 --> 00:14:24.632
So it's just the two of us.

28
00:14:28.803 --> 00:14:31.171
How about we grab
some fresh air?

29
00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:34.642
Come on, put your shoes on.

30
00:15:14.783 --> 00:15:17.117
I really feel
connected to you.

31
00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.657
Like maybe you'll
understand.

32
00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:28.630
But I need to know.

33
00:15:30.598 --> 00:15:31.965
Can I trust you?

34
00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:40.542
See, part of my job,

35
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.377
is looking

36
00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:46.480
at everything.

37
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.920
You tell me how I'm
supposed to gaze

38
00:15:51.985 --> 00:15:53.353
at so much beauty,

39
00:15:55.489 --> 00:15:56.624
without...

40
00:15:58.526 --> 00:15:59.727
being drawn to it?

41
00:16:01.195 --> 00:16:02.764
Without wanting it.

42
00:16:02.897 --> 00:16:05.232
You want me to believe
you're one of us?

43
00:16:09.236 --> 00:16:11.038
You think I'm that stupid?

44
00:16:11.071 --> 00:16:13.273
"Only the courageous act.

45
00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.309
The rest are tyrannized

46
00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:17.779
by a legal system,
made by cowardly men

47
00:16:17.812 --> 00:16:19.714
who cannot admit
their true desires."

48
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.516
End quote.

49
00:16:24.218 --> 00:16:25.753
So what?

50
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.187
You read my book.

51
00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:29.056
I studied your book

52
00:17:47.569 --> 00:17:49.436
Daddy's home!

53
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.579
Okay, everybody.
Come on.

54
00:17:57.779 --> 00:17:59.013
You gotta clear
your plates now.

55
00:17:59.047 --> 00:18:01.583
You're gonna be late.
Let's go. Come on.

56
00:18:14.929 --> 00:18:16.396
Are you okay?

57
00:18:32.547 --> 00:18:33.715
Come on, Tim.

58
00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:35.248
What's going on?

59
00:18:44.993 --> 00:18:46.694
Just give me a week,

60
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.261
please.

61
00:18:49.797 --> 00:18:51.398
That's all I'm asking.

62
00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:58.072
One week.

63
00:19:01.709 --> 00:19:03.343
Mr. Oshinsky...

64
00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.715
Time to go home.

65
00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:43.651
Bottom line,
they've got you.

66
00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:47.487
20 to 30, conservative.

67
00:19:48.823 --> 00:19:50.457
But here's the thing...

68
00:19:51.592 --> 00:19:53.928
Whatever they build up
against you --

69
00:19:55.096 --> 00:19:56.764
I'll knock down.

70
00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:59.232
That's my job.

71
00:20:06.774 --> 00:20:07.875
But,...

72
00:20:08.109 --> 00:20:09.844
here's the thing I need...

73
00:20:16.383 --> 00:20:17.752
I need a real one.

74
00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:21.756
I don't act on
my fantasies.

75
00:20:22.255 --> 00:20:24.592
What about that trip
you took last year?

76
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.862
The one out of Cartagena?

77
00:20:30.164 --> 00:20:32.232
The "Butterfly Cruise".

78
00:20:35.069 --> 00:20:36.804
Come on.

79
00:20:42.176 --> 00:20:44.377
I need this,
my friend.

80
00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:48.015
Almost as bad as you do.

81
00:21:21.616 --> 00:21:23.818
But I already have
three copies.

82
00:21:24.018 --> 00:21:25.186
Not like this.

83
00:21:25.219 --> 00:21:27.320
There's an inscription
on the inside.

84
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:28.856
Just for you.

85
00:21:34.327 --> 00:21:36.463
"To the
bravest man I know.

86
00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:39.967
Though I didn't know
it at the time."

87
00:21:40.802 --> 00:21:41.836
So Sweet.

88
00:21:42.203 --> 00:21:43.403
Flip the page.

89
00:21:50.443 --> 00:21:52.613
His name
is Teddy Bear.

90
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.522
My God, he's so little.

91
00:22:02.056 --> 00:22:02.990
Yeah.

92
00:22:03.124 --> 00:22:04.826
This time tomorrow,

93
00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:06.661
that little boy

94
00:22:06.694 --> 00:22:09.630
is gonna be yours for
the whole weekend.

95
00:22:15.603 --> 00:22:16.971
"Better a millstone

96
00:22:18.873 --> 00:22:20.407
be hung around your neck

97
00:22:21.742 --> 00:22:23.878
and you be cast
into the sea

98
00:22:24.145 --> 00:22:25.412
than that you should

99
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:28.149
ever hurt for one of
these little ones."

100
00:22:28.583 --> 00:22:30.518
What does that mean?

101
00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:41.562
You're under arrest for
crimes against children.

102
00:23:03.383 --> 00:23:04.619
I trusted you.

103
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.788
Never trust a pedophile.

104
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.031
Line six.

105
00:24:16.624 --> 00:24:19.827
Is there some kind
of problem officer?

106
00:24:24.999 --> 00:24:28.336
Oh, yeah, that...
that's an old picture.

107
00:24:28.369 --> 00:24:30.204
You know kids are
these days.

108
00:24:30.237 --> 00:24:33.607
They just grow up so fast.

109
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:43.551
That's him.

110
00:24:43.584 --> 00:24:45.753
No, no, no,
I'm his uncle.

111
00:24:47.722 --> 00:24:49.957
I'm his uncle,
you just ask him

112
00:25:58.426 --> 00:26:00.161
Why don't you go
right over there?

113
00:26:00.194 --> 00:26:01.862
okay?

114
00:26:05.699 --> 00:26:08.402
He has lacerations

115
00:26:08.436 --> 00:26:10.905
consistent with
sexual abuse.

116
00:26:11.405 --> 00:26:14.175
It's only three or
four days old.

117
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:36.277
Help us, please.

118
00:31:51.278 --> 00:31:54.616
They're ready Amigo,
you pick.

119
00:32:10.532 --> 00:32:11.533
That one there.

120
00:32:11.965 --> 00:32:14.001
No! No! No!

121
00:32:29.283 --> 00:32:31.318
These are good for
when he wake up.

122
00:32:34.321 --> 00:32:38.025
Alright now, Fuego.
Don't party too much.

123
00:34:16.456 --> 00:34:17.424
No?

124
00:34:27.802 --> 00:34:29.202
You gonna love it.

125
00:34:30.939 --> 00:34:33.407
You just gonna
really love it.

126
00:38:02.016 --> 00:38:04.018
She's just Miranda's age.

127
00:38:07.287 --> 00:38:10.323
Imagine walking into her
room right now...

128
00:38:12.026 --> 00:38:14.361
Seeing an empty bed.

129
00:38:17.064 --> 00:38:19.432
What would we do?

130
00:39:36.744 --> 00:39:38.713
You're gonna rot
in jail, Earl,

131
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.716
the only question is
which one?

132
00:39:42.583 --> 00:39:44.352
And normally I'd
extradite your ass

133
00:39:44.384 --> 00:39:45.753
straight to Colombia.

134
00:39:47.121 --> 00:39:50.691
There you'd be
raped every day,

135
00:39:51.158 --> 00:39:53.261
have your balls cut off.

136
00:39:53.828 --> 00:39:55.428
Which quite frankly
you deserve.

137
00:39:55.462 --> 00:39:57.198
Or you can tell me
what I need to know,

138
00:39:57.231 --> 00:39:59.800
and stay in the U.S.

139
00:40:02.803 --> 00:40:04.772
Get this to our embassy in
Columbia as soon as

140
00:40:04.805 --> 00:40:06.974
possible and set me up for
another call with

141
00:40:07.008 --> 00:40:07.875
the national police.

142
00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:08.976
Got it.

143
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.046
Captain Jorge? I'm good,
thank you. Hey, I...

144
00:42:15.703 --> 00:42:18.139
Rocio Aguilar.

145
00:42:18.773 --> 00:42:20.741
The boy's sister.

146
00:42:23.611 --> 00:42:24.912
Now pull-up on the
reins here, son --

147
00:42:24.945 --> 00:42:28.049
we're going to hand this
case to the prosecution,

148
00:42:28.082 --> 00:42:30.284
and we're gonna let the
Colombians mop-up Colombia.

149
00:42:30.317 --> 00:42:32.386
Which means she'll
disappear, sir.

150
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.788
For good.

151
00:42:34.255 --> 00:42:35.589
We're Homeland Security,

152
00:42:35.623 --> 00:42:36.724
you know we can't
go off rescuing

153
00:42:36.757 --> 00:42:38.793
Honduran kids in Colombia.

154
00:42:39.427 --> 00:42:41.462
Look, the boy's back
with his father --

155
00:42:41.495 --> 00:42:44.231
that's a career-capper,
take it and move on.

156
00:42:57.144 --> 00:42:58.145
I can't.

157
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:01.615
I don't...

158
00:43:01.649 --> 00:43:03.584
think you understand
what I'm asking you.

159
00:43:06.087 --> 00:43:07.321
See ah...

160
00:43:11.492 --> 00:43:15.362
This job tears
you to pieces.

161
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.998
And this is...

162
00:43:18.732 --> 00:43:23.771
my one chance to put those
pieces back together.

163
00:43:30.077 --> 00:43:32.279
I suppose I could tell
DC that you're...

164
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.916
You're going down there to
have a "training seminar".

165
00:43:37.418 --> 00:43:39.820
Fund it out of
discretionary.

166
00:43:40.721 --> 00:43:42.289
Keep it under ten grand.

167
00:43:44.225 --> 00:43:46.026
Honey...

168
00:44:02.209 --> 00:44:03.744
Hey...

169
00:44:07.848 --> 00:44:09.584
Welcome to Cartagena.

170
00:44:09.618 --> 00:44:11.185
Mucho gusto.

171
00:44:52.893 --> 00:44:56.665
So, I took the liberty of
sending your report

172
00:44:56.697 --> 00:44:58.399
to a "non-police" type.

173
00:44:58.465 --> 00:45:00.467
And he came back
with a lead.

174
00:45:01.268 --> 00:45:03.470
Welcome to his office.

175
00:45:28.095 --> 00:45:31.398
There are two things you
should know about Vampiro.

176
00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:34.703
He ran the Cali cartel's
money-laundering operations

177
00:45:34.735 --> 00:45:36.003
in the nineties.

178
00:45:36.671 --> 00:45:38.439
He did time in prison.

179
00:45:40.174 --> 00:45:43.444
And the second thing:
He buys children.

180
00:45:45.779 --> 00:45:48.182
And then he sets them free.

181
00:45:49.183 --> 00:45:51.885
He puts these kids
in safe houses.

182
00:45:52.721 --> 00:45:56.090
He gives them a
new chance at life.

183
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.995
Vampiro!

184
00:46:07.602 --> 00:46:09.671
Some ground-rules, Timoteo.

185
00:46:10.037 --> 00:46:12.906
Don't ever step into my
office again looking like

186
00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:14.341
you just walked
out of a friggin'

187
00:46:14.375 --> 00:46:15.776
Banana Republic ad.

188
00:46:16.243 --> 00:46:17.011
Hm?

189
00:46:17.778 --> 00:46:19.313
Save that for Bogotá, man.

190
00:46:19.614 --> 00:46:21.081
This is Cartagena.

191
00:46:21.115 --> 00:46:23.350
It's a beach town,
a party town.

192
00:46:23.784 --> 00:46:25.019
Lighten up.

193
00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.755
Jorge,

194
00:46:27.187 --> 00:46:29.356
guy's down here looking for
a little pedo-action,

195
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:30.558
what's he wear?

196
00:46:31.492 --> 00:46:33.528
Chancletas, flip-flops,
T-shirt.

197
00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:35.829
Exactly.
What I need to see

198
00:46:35.863 --> 00:46:38.432
is some horny hung-over
rich American,

199
00:46:38.465 --> 00:46:39.833
stinking of beer,

200
00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:42.870
crawling out of a big
honking automobile.

201
00:46:43.538 --> 00:46:45.573
Rent something obnoxious.

202
00:46:45.607 --> 00:46:47.374
And black.

203
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:51.245
And now Timoteo, the kid.

204
00:46:51.278 --> 00:46:52.079
Miguel.

205
00:46:52.346 --> 00:46:54.248
He's back with his father,
huh?

206
00:46:54.281 --> 00:46:55.282
Yes.

207
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.851
How did that
make you feel?

208
00:46:58.553 --> 00:47:00.588
Giving a child
his freedom?

209
00:47:01.188 --> 00:47:02.456
Felt good.

210
00:47:02.489 --> 00:47:05.859
Like, "back-rub" good, or
"chicken-wings" good?

211
00:47:05.893 --> 00:47:07.595
What kind of good are we
talking about here?

212
00:47:09.096 --> 00:47:10.665
The kind that gives hope.

213
00:47:10.799 --> 00:47:12.667
Come on, amigo.

214
00:47:12.701 --> 00:47:15.903
You've been at this
for 12 years.

215
00:47:16.837 --> 00:47:19.039
Why are you doing it?

216
00:47:24.144 --> 00:47:28.349
Because God's children
are not for sale.

217
00:47:37.091 --> 00:47:40.194
That is why I am giving you
my Friday night.

218
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:45.065
And the plan unfolds.

219
00:47:50.003 --> 00:47:52.574
Now the sister,
the pretty one,

220
00:47:53.273 --> 00:47:54.108
What's her name?

221
00:47:54.141 --> 00:47:54.942
Rocio.

222
00:47:55.008 --> 00:47:56.076
As of this moment,

223
00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.277
she could be a block
down the road,

224
00:47:57.311 --> 00:48:01.516
or she could be in
Moscow, Bangkok, L.A.

225
00:48:02.249 --> 00:48:03.752
And yes,

226
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:07.254
I do know an young
attractive woman

227
00:48:07.287 --> 00:48:08.956
who matches your "Giselle".

228
00:48:09.223 --> 00:48:13.227
Major operator,
runs 10, 15 kids.

229
00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.429
Sources her children out
of Central America,

230
00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:18.098
so she doesn't have to deal
with the Colombian cops.

231
00:48:18.132 --> 00:48:20.100
Lures them in
with her looks,

232
00:48:20.134 --> 00:48:22.269
promises the sun
and the moon...

233
00:48:22.837 --> 00:48:24.071
a month later,

234
00:48:24.104 --> 00:48:25.507
they're turning five,
six tricks a night.

235
00:48:28.909 --> 00:48:31.178
You got a photo?

236
00:48:32.012 --> 00:48:33.681
That's the easy part.

237
00:48:34.783 --> 00:48:36.718
Meet Miss Cartagena.

238
00:48:37.084 --> 00:48:39.319
A verifiable beauty queen.

239
00:48:39.788 --> 00:48:42.289
Her name's Katty Juarez.

240
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:43.892
She's clean,

241
00:48:43.924 --> 00:48:45.627
not even a parking ticket
in the colonial area.

242
00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.463
No record of leaving
Colombia since she was 12.

243
00:48:49.764 --> 00:48:51.533
Set me up on a date.

244
00:48:51.566 --> 00:48:55.135
Tell Miss Cartagena

245
00:48:55.436 --> 00:48:57.404
you got a horny,
hung-over, rich, American

246
00:48:57.438 --> 00:48:59.273
looking for a little
pedo-action.

247
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.043
You don't just set up a
date with Katty Juarez.

248
00:49:03.812 --> 00:49:06.113
She only deals with
street traffickers,

249
00:49:06.146 --> 00:49:08.315
people she knows,
old friends.

250
00:49:08.348 --> 00:49:10.484
She keeps her nails
very clean.

251
00:49:11.318 --> 00:49:15.055
That is a tough
marlin to hook.

252
00:49:29.504 --> 00:49:35.375
AMERICAN EXECUTIVE RAN
CHILD SEX CLUB IN THAILAND

253
00:49:42.584 --> 00:49:45.687
Guy was making close to a
quarter million a month.

254
00:49:48.288 --> 00:49:51.391
You said that Katie has
about 15-20 kids, right?

255
00:49:51.693 --> 00:49:53.126
Scattered all over
Cartagena?

256
00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.330
Probably some in
Cali, Medellin?

257
00:49:56.965 --> 00:49:58.065
Timoteo?

258
00:49:58.098 --> 00:50:00.501
So Rocio could be anywhere.

259
00:50:01.201 --> 00:50:03.337
But what if we needed
all those kids?

260
00:50:03.972 --> 00:50:05.640
I don't understand, amigo.

261
00:50:05.907 --> 00:50:07.207
You ever heard of
Club Bangkok?

262
00:50:07.374 --> 00:50:09.644
It's a members-only club
full of rich perverts,

263
00:50:09.677 --> 00:50:12.246
jet-setters, CEO's.
It's a high-end facility,

264
00:50:12.279 --> 00:50:15.115
stocked 24/7 with
a hundred kids.

265
00:50:15.148 --> 00:50:16.951
And who supplied them?

266
00:50:16.985 --> 00:50:19.286
A bunch of sex traffickers
who got greedy.

267
00:50:19.521 --> 00:50:21.221
If they can build
one in Bangkok

268
00:50:21.255 --> 00:50:23.691
why can't we
build one here?

269
00:50:26.293 --> 00:50:28.897
You wanna build a
high-end sex hotel?

270
00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:29.998
Yes I do.

271
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.733
And I found just
the right investor.

272
00:50:38.673 --> 00:50:41.375
Pablo Delgado --
runs a four billion dollar

273
00:50:41.408 --> 00:50:43.545
real estate development
company, with holdings

274
00:50:43.578 --> 00:50:44.679
all over the world.

275
00:50:44.946 --> 00:50:46.280
He loves to play cop.

276
00:50:46.446 --> 00:50:48.983
We've already used him
on two separate missions,

277
00:50:49.017 --> 00:50:50.150
he eats this stuff up.

278
00:50:50.183 --> 00:50:52.219
That's the look, my friend.

279
00:50:52.754 --> 00:50:55.188
And he can build
a sex hotel

280
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:57.659
anywhere he wants.

281
00:50:58.058 --> 00:51:00.193
you know someone who can
bring a deal like this

282
00:51:00.227 --> 00:51:02.296
to the marketplace?

283
00:51:09.904 --> 00:51:11.271
Hello, pretty.

284
00:51:12.774 --> 00:51:14.074
Calacas!

285
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.377
Vampiro!

286
00:51:21.281 --> 00:51:23.250
Where is your horny friend?

287
00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:24.986
Change of plans.

288
00:51:25.252 --> 00:51:26.453
Put on a bow tie.

289
00:51:26.486 --> 00:51:28.690
We're going to the
classy part of town.

290
00:51:36.931 --> 00:51:38.498
Like the old days.

291
00:51:42.336 --> 00:51:47.107
Wow! This guy knows
how to party.

292
00:51:52.647 --> 00:51:54.114
That's it, amigo.

293
00:51:54.147 --> 00:51:56.383
No more aguardiente.

294
00:52:04.525 --> 00:52:07.895
I think I may have to
expand your mind

295
00:52:08.096 --> 00:52:10.531
to an entirely new reality.

296
00:52:11.933 --> 00:52:13.333
Okay.

297
00:52:14.102 --> 00:52:16.504
These gentlemen
want to build

298
00:52:16.838 --> 00:52:17.905
a one of a kind,

299
00:52:17.939 --> 00:52:20.875
members-only club
near Cartagena.

300
00:52:21.509 --> 00:52:23.044
Annual fee:

301
00:52:23.578 --> 00:52:26.313
one hundred grand
per member.

302
00:52:26.581 --> 00:52:28.683
They take care of
the facility

303
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:30.685
we take care of the talent.

304
00:52:30.918 --> 00:52:32.219
And the members,

305
00:52:32.419 --> 00:52:34.789
they get a
world-class resort

306
00:52:34.956 --> 00:52:38.458
with full access
to models, 24/7,

307
00:52:38.559 --> 00:52:40.460
all-you-can-eat.

308
00:52:41.095 --> 00:52:44.297
Live-in models. Young ones.

309
00:52:44.632 --> 00:52:45.667
How young?

310
00:52:46.299 --> 00:52:48.201
Shock me.

311
00:52:49.871 --> 00:52:51.072
Which one is this?

312
00:52:51.271 --> 00:52:53.041
El Calacas.

313
00:52:53.641 --> 00:52:56.744
He used to deliver
escorts for Escobar.

314
00:52:57.344 --> 00:52:59.681
He sold me a
chicken last year,

315
00:52:59.847 --> 00:53:01.582
9 years old.

316
00:53:01.783 --> 00:53:04.184
And she was...

317
00:53:05.687 --> 00:53:10.591
Nine legit or a
15 year-old with pigtails?

318
00:53:10.625 --> 00:53:13.127
I deal in pure
cocaine, papi...

319
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:16.931
So how many chickens
do you want?

320
00:53:17.197 --> 00:53:18.733
For starters,

321
00:53:19.834 --> 00:53:21.769
50 or 60.

322
00:53:24.939 --> 00:53:26.306
Minimum.

323
00:53:26.941 --> 00:53:30.277
Go big or go home. Right?

324
00:53:33.114 --> 00:53:36.383
I think your amigo
ate the worm.

325
00:53:37.384 --> 00:53:40.253
I think he just sobered up.

326
00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:47.294
That's a lot of
chickens, papi.

327
00:53:48.029 --> 00:53:50.531
No one can do that alone.

328
00:53:53.601 --> 00:53:56.704
I'm not asking you if
you can do it alone.

329
00:53:57.739 --> 00:54:00.575
I'm just asking if
you can do it.

330
00:55:10.778 --> 00:55:13.247
...plus five support agents
for a month in-country,

331
00:55:13.281 --> 00:55:14.649
the penthouse in Bogota,

332
00:55:14.682 --> 00:55:17.285
the mansion in Cartagena,
on and on,

333
00:55:17.317 --> 00:55:18.920
and yet somehow...

334
00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.755
somehow, you have
failed to bring me

335
00:55:20.788 --> 00:55:22.489
one real-world lead,

336
00:55:22.523 --> 00:55:24.892
or one American child,
or one American trafficker,

337
00:55:24.926 --> 00:55:27.228
or one reason DC would
let you within a million

338
00:55:27.261 --> 00:55:29.130
miles of this, and a bunch
of glamor shots

339
00:55:29.163 --> 00:55:30.865
of Miss Cartagena
don't count!

340
00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:31.933
She has the girl.

341
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.400
And I say the girl
is in Russia.

342
00:55:33.433 --> 00:55:35.036
Prove me wrong.

343
00:55:41.876 --> 00:55:43.644
It's over, Tim.

344
00:55:44.212 --> 00:55:45.847
Close up,

345
00:55:46.379 --> 00:55:48.649
get on a plane and

346
00:55:48.716 --> 00:55:50.885
come back home.

347
00:55:59.093 --> 00:56:01.629
Bureaucracy is shit.

348
00:56:03.164 --> 00:56:06.734
This is why I
operate black.

349
00:56:15.243 --> 00:56:17.612
Have a nice flight,
Timoteo.

350
00:56:20.214 --> 00:56:21.983
You were a cartel guy...

351
00:56:23.517 --> 00:56:24.986
Yeah.

352
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.557
Kept your mouth shut,
did your time.

353
00:56:29.991 --> 00:56:32.727
Could've picked up
where you left off,

354
00:56:33.426 --> 00:56:35.963
bought yourself a condo
on the beach.

355
00:56:38.431 --> 00:56:41.769
Instead you're doing this.
Why?

356
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:44.105
Really?

357
00:57:05.492 --> 00:57:08.062
I had that condo
on the beach.

358
00:57:09.263 --> 00:57:11.565
Fifteenth floor,
marble everything,

359
00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.834
overlooking the whole bay.

360
00:57:14.802 --> 00:57:17.939
First night out of jail I
slept in my own bed.

361
00:57:18.873 --> 00:57:21.309
Day two, I was
back in business,

362
00:57:21.342 --> 00:57:23.210
same old life.

363
00:57:23.611 --> 00:57:27.248
But it doesn't
feel right --

364
00:57:27.515 --> 00:57:29.583
not the drugs,
not the hookers.

365
00:57:29.617 --> 00:57:33.621
But dammit if I didn't
keep trying...

366
00:57:37.024 --> 00:57:39.026
So one night

367
00:57:41.028 --> 00:57:43.798
I'm leaving a bar all
jacked up on coca

368
00:57:43.831 --> 00:57:48.069
and I notice this young
girl on the corner.

369
00:57:48.468 --> 00:57:51.539
Fine looking, maybe 20, 25.

370
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.010
I take her up to my place,
do the deed, pay the bill.

371
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.512
She's putting on her shoes,

372
00:57:59.146 --> 00:58:00.915
and I notice something.

373
00:58:03.317 --> 00:58:05.186
I notice her foot.

374
00:58:06.587 --> 00:58:08.422
She's got these little

375
00:58:08.656 --> 00:58:12.626
pink cat faces painted
on her toenails.

376
00:58:14.494 --> 00:58:16.197
And it hit me.

377
00:58:16.998 --> 00:58:18.766
She's not 25.

378
00:58:21.602 --> 00:58:24.839
Then she glances up
and our eyes connect.

379
00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.274
And

380
00:58:28.576 --> 00:58:32.179
it was like I was granted
a glimpse into her soul,

381
00:58:35.216 --> 00:58:39.053
and all I saw
was sadness...

382
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:43.557
Out of nowhere
she starts talking.

383
00:58:43.591 --> 00:58:46.794
Turns out she's not 25.
Not even 20.

384
00:58:48.562 --> 00:58:52.633
This girl is 14 years old,
Timoteo.

385
00:58:54.068 --> 00:58:57.238
She's been doing this
since she was six.

386
00:58:59.473 --> 00:59:00.875
Looks at me,

387
00:59:01.008 --> 00:59:01.942
smiles,

388
00:59:02.076 --> 00:59:03.310
takes the money,

389
00:59:03.344 --> 00:59:05.146
walks out the door.

390
00:59:17.691 --> 00:59:20.428
All of a sudden I'm hit
by this tidal wave,

391
00:59:20.861 --> 00:59:24.598
this tsunami of darkness,

392
00:59:24.865 --> 00:59:26.467
and I know

393
00:59:26.834 --> 00:59:29.804
I'm the sadness
in her eyes. Me.

394
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:33.107
I'm the darkness.

395
00:59:36.444 --> 00:59:38.245
And I know

396
00:59:39.313 --> 00:59:42.149
the darkness has to die.

397
00:59:45.453 --> 00:59:48.222
So I get my 45.

398
00:59:55.162 --> 00:59:57.231
Put it to my head.

399
00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.635
Put my finger
on the trigger.

400
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:08.476
Now if there's a time
to ask if God exists,

401
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.611
that would be it.

402
01:00:22.089 --> 01:00:23.390
So I did.

403
01:00:25.793 --> 01:00:28.963
When God tells
you what to do,

404
01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.401
you cannot hesitate.

405
01:00:56.757 --> 01:00:58.259
So you've thought
of that...

406
01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:00.127
of doing it on your own?

407
01:01:00.629 --> 01:01:02.663
I won't be on my own.

408
01:01:03.632 --> 01:01:05.799
I just have to
convince Pablo.

409
01:01:06.467 --> 01:01:08.135
Okay.

410
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:12.273
So you quit your job

411
01:01:13.474 --> 01:01:16.043
and you go and
rescue these kids.

412
01:01:44.939 --> 01:01:47.141
My resignation's
in your box.

413
01:01:47.642 --> 01:01:50.311
Wait. You do realize

414
01:01:50.778 --> 01:01:53.414
you're ten months away from
vesting your pension.

415
01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:55.349
I do.

416
01:01:57.885 --> 01:01:59.853
You know I did
everything I could,

417
01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:02.122
but the law is the law.

418
01:02:04.659 --> 01:02:06.460
Did you know that were
over 22 million

419
01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:07.962
new images of
child pornography

420
01:02:07.995 --> 01:02:09.396
on the web this past year?

421
01:02:10.864 --> 01:02:12.032
That's a five
thousand percent

422
01:02:12.066 --> 01:02:14.868
increase over the
past five years.

423
01:02:15.502 --> 01:02:17.404
Five thousand percent.

424
01:02:19.106 --> 01:02:20.140
The fact is

425
01:02:20.508 --> 01:02:23.612
it is the fastest growing
international crime network

426
01:02:23.645 --> 01:02:25.312
that the world
has ever seen.

427
01:02:26.715 --> 01:02:28.449
I agreed to it because
we were working

428
01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:29.850
with the U.S. government.

429
01:02:29.883 --> 01:02:31.452
If you back out now this
whole thing will blow!

430
01:02:31.752 --> 01:02:33.622
It has already passed the
illegal arms trade.

431
01:02:33.655 --> 01:02:35.856
And soon it's gonna
pass the drug trade.

432
01:02:35.889 --> 01:02:37.258
You Wanna know why?

433
01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:40.327
Because you can sell a
bag of cocaine one time.

434
01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:44.832
But a child, the most
precious child...

435
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.501
You can sell a five
year-old kid

436
01:02:47.901 --> 01:02:50.037
five to ten times a day

437
01:02:51.539 --> 01:02:53.508
for ten years straight!

438
01:02:55.409 --> 01:02:57.778
And everyday
ordinary people

439
01:02:58.846 --> 01:03:00.347
don't want to hear it,

440
01:03:01.048 --> 01:03:03.752
it's too ugly for
polite conversation,

441
01:03:04.018 --> 01:03:06.020
but meanwhile over two
million children a year

442
01:03:06.053 --> 01:03:09.223
are being sucked into the
deepest recesses of hell.

443
01:03:09.591 --> 01:03:12.893
Trust me, man.
If we do nothing,

444
01:03:17.965 --> 01:03:20.467
their pain is gonna
spread and spread

445
01:03:21.402 --> 01:03:24.838
till some day it's gonna
reach the likes of you.

446
01:03:26.807 --> 01:03:28.909
And that will be
a nightmare

447
01:03:29.043 --> 01:03:31.478
that you never gonna
wake up from.

448
01:03:35.784 --> 01:03:37.284
I'm sorry.

449
01:03:57.104 --> 01:03:58.807
Sir, the gentleman
who just left

450
01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:00.575
asked me to give you this.

451
01:05:06.273 --> 01:05:08.308
Jorge found us a property
on Cartagena Bay.

452
01:05:08.342 --> 01:05:09.977
It's a private
island confiscated

453
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:11.478
by the Colombian
government.

454
01:05:11.513 --> 01:05:13.013
Here's some intel on that.

455
01:05:13.414 --> 01:05:15.149
The palapa will be
located here.

456
01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:18.118
The traffickers will
arrive up here...

457
01:05:22.557 --> 01:05:24.659
So what do you think?

458
01:05:34.769 --> 01:05:37.337
2.6 Not bad, huh?

459
01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.812
So let's go meet
him in Bogota

460
01:05:43.845 --> 01:05:45.446
and get him excited.

461
01:06:21.215 --> 01:06:22.416
Better?

462
01:06:22.483 --> 01:06:23.317
Too stiff.

463
01:06:24.318 --> 01:06:25.352
If you don't know
what to say,

464
01:06:25.385 --> 01:06:27.354
just don't say
anything at all.

465
01:06:27.555 --> 01:06:28.388
Silence.

466
01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:30.725
Don't forget to smile.

467
01:06:31.291 --> 01:06:32.493
I forgot.

468
01:06:44.404 --> 01:06:45.439
My love...

469
01:06:50.879 --> 01:06:53.180
Yeah. I don't know
about the kiss.

470
01:07:09.296 --> 01:07:13.166
Welcome. Beware of
your heads.

471
01:07:19.273 --> 01:07:22.577
My soul brother,
let me introduce Katty.

472
01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:25.445
Katty, this is the man
that's gonna make

473
01:07:25.479 --> 01:07:28.115
your dreams come true.
Pablo.

474
01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:30.952
Gentlemen...

475
01:07:30.985 --> 01:07:32.219
Adolfo.

476
01:07:32.452 --> 01:07:33.253
Adolfo.

477
01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:35.790
Don Fuego.

478
01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:36.858
Don Fuego.

479
01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:38.292
You know El Calacas.

480
01:07:38.893 --> 01:07:39.928
Extravagant.

481
01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.461
Who would like a drink?

482
01:07:42.329 --> 01:07:43.598
We've got fourteen members

483
01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:45.365
showing up for the
"Kick-Off Party," plus

484
01:07:46.266 --> 01:07:47.902
a dozen prospects.

485
01:07:48.168 --> 01:07:50.805
And we would like
all our talent on site,

486
01:07:51.005 --> 01:07:53.908
rested, tested
and ready to rock

487
01:07:53.942 --> 01:07:56.511
the day before the
first guest arrives.

488
01:07:56.578 --> 01:07:58.111
Absolutely.

489
01:07:58.746 --> 01:08:00.447
So

490
01:08:00.915 --> 01:08:02.684
how many can you deliver?

491
01:08:03.918 --> 01:08:05.319
You asked for 50.

492
01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:07.254
At least that,

493
01:08:07.889 --> 01:08:11.491
more if you're lucky.

494
01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:18.398
Tell me, amor...

495
01:08:20.935 --> 01:08:23.270
What do you like?

496
01:08:36.718 --> 01:08:38.586
Depends on the mood.

497
01:08:55.603 --> 01:08:59.206
Just deliver no less
than 50 models.

498
01:08:59.941 --> 01:09:02.175
And you will
leave the island...

499
01:09:02.543 --> 01:09:04.444
with 100 grand

500
01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:25.767
Cheers.

501
01:09:25.833 --> 01:09:26.868
Cheers.

502
01:09:26.934 --> 01:09:27.969
Cheers.

503
01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.273
Ok, it's handled...

504
01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.976
you have the support of our
Embassy in Colombia,

505
01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:36.309
One of our guys
will track the raid

506
01:09:36.343 --> 01:09:38.913
in case you need any
legal back-up.

507
01:09:41.816 --> 01:09:43.350
Hey Tim,

508
01:09:45.787 --> 01:09:47.354
I hope you find her.

509
01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:08.976
For you, papi.

510
01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.678
Gracias.

511
01:10:13.447 --> 01:10:14.982
Negotiation is over there.

512
01:10:15.016 --> 01:10:16.450
I want the kids back here,

513
01:10:16.483 --> 01:10:19.486
as far away from the
traffickers as possible...

514
01:10:36.704 --> 01:10:38.940
They didn't bring
all the kids.

515
01:10:39.272 --> 01:10:40.708
It doesn't surprise me.

516
01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:42.910
It gotta be less than 30.

517
01:10:47.815 --> 01:10:53.453
Let's go. Quick,
so you don't get wet.

518
01:11:18.478 --> 01:11:19.981
You keeping the rest
of the talent

519
01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:21.616
in the glove compartment?

520
01:11:22.049 --> 01:11:23.483
They'll be here soon.

521
01:11:32.026 --> 01:11:33.961
Osorio Rodriguez.

522
01:11:35.963 --> 01:11:38.866
But my friends
call me Carne.

523
01:11:40.768 --> 01:11:42.203
Carne is our lawyer.

524
01:11:42.236 --> 01:11:44.705
He got good friends
at the borders.

525
01:11:47.842 --> 01:11:49.076
No, no, no, no, no.

526
01:11:49.309 --> 01:11:51.311
No Don King.

527
01:11:51.546 --> 01:11:54.515
I like to get in the ring.

528
01:12:11.032 --> 01:12:13.400
Tenacious. Love him.

529
01:12:17.772 --> 01:12:19.472
That's it.

530
01:13:04.318 --> 01:13:06.654
Excuse me. Want more?

531
01:13:09.257 --> 01:13:10.490
And what's plan B?

532
01:13:11.626 --> 01:13:12.627
We wait.

533
01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:15.363
We're not gonna lose the
kids in the other boat.

534
01:13:15.495 --> 01:13:17.665
Rocio must be with them.

535
01:13:18.165 --> 01:13:19.233
Jorge, listen to me.

536
01:13:19.399 --> 01:13:20.601
When you land,

537
01:13:20.868 --> 01:13:23.704
take their fat bulldog and
get him off the island,

538
01:13:23.738 --> 01:13:27.642
keep him separate
and no handcuffs.

539
01:13:29.377 --> 01:13:33.180
No, no, no, no, no.
Sorry. He's mine.

540
01:13:34.815 --> 01:13:36.918
Choose another.

541
01:13:38.653 --> 01:13:41.122
You're joking, right?

542
01:13:50.998 --> 01:13:52.967
You know where is the most

543
01:13:53.234 --> 01:13:55.770
dangerous place
in Colombia?

544
01:13:57.204 --> 01:13:59.040
Between me

545
01:14:00.241 --> 01:14:02.677
and my chicken.

546
01:14:15.756 --> 01:14:17.858
You're a real big man, huh?

547
01:14:19.393 --> 01:14:21.529
I can kill you
without a glance.

548
01:14:23.698 --> 01:14:25.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

549
01:14:30.271 --> 01:14:32.974
Give the man what he wants.

550
01:14:40.715 --> 01:14:45.619
Carne, tell your fathead
goon to put this gun away.

551
01:15:14.181 --> 01:15:15.883
Alright.

552
01:15:16.584 --> 01:15:17.752
Come on, guys.

553
01:15:17.785 --> 01:15:19.920
Let's have a drink, huh?

554
01:15:20.454 --> 01:15:21.689
Hey,

555
01:15:22.757 --> 01:15:25.659
you'll have all afternoon
in that damn bungalow.

556
01:16:16.410 --> 01:16:23.150
Hurray! Finally arrived!

557
01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.017
Stop! Hands up!
Nobody moves!

558
01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:07.695
On the ground!
On the ground!

559
01:17:42.263 --> 01:17:43.264
Who set us up?

560
01:17:44.431 --> 01:17:45.666
Your Don King?

561
01:18:22.571 --> 01:18:24.305
Fifty four kids.

562
01:18:26.473 --> 01:18:28.742
Did you get their names?

563
01:18:33.247 --> 01:18:35.316
Rocio?

564
01:18:41.822 --> 01:18:44.291
I'm sorry, Tim.

565
01:18:44.425 --> 01:18:46.493
But we rescued 54.

566
01:19:43.685 --> 01:19:45.419
Hear that?

567
01:19:56.531 --> 01:19:59.233
That's the
sound of freedom.

568
01:20:12.514 --> 01:20:13.347
I hear it.

569
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:57.211
Hm.

570
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.149
Fuego handed her off here.

571
01:24:42.316 --> 01:24:44.351
At a village on
the Guáitara River.

572
01:24:44.586 --> 01:24:48.155
South of that river,
it's all rebel territory.

573
01:24:49.657 --> 01:24:51.191
No one goes in.

574
01:24:51.425 --> 01:24:54.361
Not the army,
not the police.

575
01:24:54.662 --> 01:24:56.396
Not us.

576
01:25:01.335 --> 01:25:02.502
What?

577
01:25:03.605 --> 01:25:04.806
That's it?

578
01:25:05.105 --> 01:25:06.306
You're talking
about extracting

579
01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:08.610
an 11 year-old girl
from unknown terrain.

580
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:10.044
So?

581
01:25:10.177 --> 01:25:12.245
It's controlled by an
army of rebels!

582
01:25:12.379 --> 01:25:13.280
Right.

583
01:25:14.048 --> 01:25:16.283
Forget about what could
happen to us!

584
01:25:16.751 --> 01:25:19.353
She could be killed too...

585
01:25:23.558 --> 01:25:25.526
Tim.

586
01:25:27.929 --> 01:25:31.733
What if this was your
daughter, Jorge.

587
01:25:38.338 --> 01:25:41.141
Sorry, man.
She's gone.

588
01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:44.846
She got sold to
the wrong guy!

589
01:25:45.113 --> 01:25:48.281
Unless that guy
needs our help.

590
01:25:51.552 --> 01:25:53.554
I remember hearing
about a groups

591
01:25:53.588 --> 01:25:57.290
that could sweet-talk their
way into those areas.

592
01:25:57.592 --> 01:25:58.492
Medical folks,

593
01:25:58.626 --> 01:26:02.429
treating cholera, malaria,
dengue fever.

594
01:26:04.197 --> 01:26:05.867
Makes me wonder

595
01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:08.402
if there's any epidemics

596
01:26:08.435 --> 01:26:11.171
going around the
mountains these days.

597
01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:23.216
Put up your hand.

598
01:26:23.518 --> 01:26:24.284
What?

599
01:26:24.317 --> 01:26:26.587
I said "put up your hand".

600
01:26:34.996 --> 01:26:37.197
These gringos.

601
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:44.572
Now you're a doctor.

602
01:26:45.039 --> 01:26:47.374
Moving up in life.

603
01:27:08.162 --> 01:27:09.630
Tim!

604
01:27:10.198 --> 01:27:12.033
I got orders.

605
01:27:12.232 --> 01:27:14.869
I can go as far
as the river.

606
01:27:14.902 --> 01:27:16.604
No further.

607
01:27:17.304 --> 01:27:19.640
When you get on that water,

608
01:27:20.041 --> 01:27:21.776
you're on your own.

609
01:27:22.309 --> 01:27:23.644
Do me a favor.

610
01:27:23.978 --> 01:27:25.747
Keep these with you.

611
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:29.884
GPS?

612
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:33.420
You can keep it in
your wallet or...

613
01:27:33.955 --> 01:27:36.691
I don't know, inject it.

614
01:27:43.231 --> 01:27:46.433
So you can locate
our bodies, hm?

615
01:29:11.451 --> 01:29:13.087
Hey, Timoteo...

616
01:29:18.391 --> 01:29:20.228
If things go
south tomorrow,

617
01:29:20.261 --> 01:29:23.164
which is not
particularly unlikely,

618
01:29:23.698 --> 01:29:25.800
there's no
Marine unit coming.

619
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.035
We're done.

620
01:30:31.899 --> 01:30:33.067
Hey.

621
01:30:33.834 --> 01:30:35.202
Take this.

622
01:30:36.170 --> 01:30:37.705
I'll feel safer.

623
01:30:38.973 --> 01:30:41.776
I think I'll be
better off without it.

624
01:31:42.670 --> 01:31:45.272
I hope we get a
warm welcome.

625
01:31:54.715 --> 01:31:57.084
Don't shoot. Don't...

626
01:31:57.518 --> 01:32:00.021
Get down!
Are you out of your mind?

627
01:33:25.574 --> 01:33:27.274
Come on.

628
01:33:32.146 --> 01:33:35.049
If I come back in the dark,
be ready to run.

629
01:34:16.625 --> 01:34:17.858
What's happening?

630
01:34:18.225 --> 01:34:20.127
He's on his own.

631
01:37:14.435 --> 01:37:17.438
You got some cojones
coming here, amigo.

632
01:37:20.441 --> 01:37:22.376
The cholera must be bad.

633
01:37:23.077 --> 01:37:25.580
There are cases in Leticia,

634
01:37:25.814 --> 01:37:30.117
San Gil, and it can
spread like wildfire.

635
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:32.086
So with your permission

636
01:37:32.186 --> 01:37:34.789
I'd like to take the rest
of the evening to

637
01:37:34.823 --> 01:37:36.123
look for anyone

638
01:37:36.223 --> 01:37:39.126
who might need our
immediate attention.

639
01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:42.129
If I do -- God forbid --

640
01:37:42.296 --> 01:37:44.865
we'll have to evacuate
them immediately.

641
01:37:44.898 --> 01:37:46.634
It's the only way to
make sure the cholera

642
01:37:46.668 --> 01:37:48.068
doesn't spread.

643
01:37:48.435 --> 01:37:49.671
Evacuate?

644
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:52.473
Yes. It's just
our protocol.

645
01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:54.576
Yeah, yeah.

646
01:38:02.483 --> 01:38:04.619
If you find sick people --

647
01:38:05.754 --> 01:38:07.354
God forbid --

648
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:09.591
you bring them to me.

649
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:11.626
My protocol.

650
01:39:49.824 --> 01:39:52.226
Rocio!

651
01:39:55.128 --> 01:39:58.265
Rocio Aguilar!

652
01:40:14.481 --> 01:40:15.650
Come here.

653
01:40:19.988 --> 01:40:21.656
Oh, shit!

654
01:40:42.075 --> 01:40:43.611
Is this one sick?

655
01:40:44.012 --> 01:40:47.782
No, no, no. They're fine.
She's fine.

656
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:10.638
Okay.

657
01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:15.677
Ei, amigo.

658
01:41:16.611 --> 01:41:19.279
Let's go, man.

659
01:44:10.818 --> 01:44:15.656
Rocio... Rocio.

660
01:44:18.092 --> 01:44:19.961
No! No!

661
01:48:32.646 --> 01:48:34.482
It's time to go home now.

662
01:48:34.515 --> 01:48:36.650
Tu casa.

663
01:48:50.998 --> 01:48:52.666
Vamos.

664
01:49:07.348 --> 01:49:10.885
Boss, boss...

665
01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:22.029
Alacran, Alacran!

666
01:49:22.997 --> 01:49:24.765
Checho!

667
01:50:18.385 --> 01:50:22.189
Yeah, yeah.
They took the boat!

668
01:50:28.129 --> 01:50:29.063
Hey!

669
01:50:31.132 --> 01:50:32.399
He's on the move.

670
01:50:32.433 --> 01:50:34.201
Look.

671
01:50:51.553 --> 01:50:53.053
Let's go, let's go.

672
01:50:57.892 --> 01:51:00.027
Go, go, go, go, go.

673
01:51:28.722 --> 01:51:29.857
You guys good?

674
01:51:30.024 --> 01:51:30.891
You alright?

675
01:51:30.925 --> 01:51:31.458
yes

676
01:51:31.593 --> 01:51:33.861
Yeah, we're fine.

677
01:54:23.230 --> 01:54:27.635
Rocio. Rocio.
