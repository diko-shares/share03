10
00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:41.665
<font color="#ffff54">Hello. I’m Giselle.</font>

11
00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.001
<font color="#ffff54">I heard you singing
in the market.</font>

12
00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:45.202
<font color="#ffff54">Remember?</font>

13
00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:46.313
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>

14
00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:48.577
<font color="#ffff54">Wow...</font>

15
00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:51.876
<font color="#ffff54">You’re even prettier
than I remember.</font>

16
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:55.418
<font color="#ffff54">Is your daddy home?</font>

17
00:01:56.543 --> 00:01:57.710
<font color="#ffff54">OK. OK.</font>

18
00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:02.491
<font color="#ffff54">Mister Aguilar?</font>

19
00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:03.605
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>

20
00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:04.399
<font color="#ffff54">Giselle.</font>

21
00:02:05.098 --> 00:02:06.515
<font color="#ffff54">Founder of “Discover
Your Dreams”.</font>

22
00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:08.170
<font color="#ffff54">Nice to meet you.</font>

23
00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.659
<font color="#ffff54">I’d love to steal five
minutes of your time.</font>

24
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:21.157
<font color="#ffff54">I believe Rocio may have the talent
to be in the entertainment business.</font>

25
00:02:23.055 --> 00:02:23.835
<font color="#ffff54">But of course,</font>

26
00:02:24.092 --> 00:02:28.092
<font color="#ffff54">you’d need to bring her to
our annual audition tomorrow.</font>

27
00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:30.842
<font color="#ffff54">If I were you, I’d convince him.</font>

28
00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.555
<font color="#ffff54">And who is this cutie?</font>

29
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.469
<font color="#ffff54">Is he your little brother?</font>

30
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.470
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>

31
00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:46.999
<font color="#ffff54">What’s your name?</font>

32
00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:18.776
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>

33
00:03:19.368 --> 00:03:21.327
<font color="#ffff54">No stage-fathers allowed.</font>

34
00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:25.000
<font color="#ffff54">But pick-up is at 7 p.m. Sharp.</font>

35
00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:27.959
<font color="#ffff54">- Okay.
- Bye, daddy.</font>

36
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.092
<font color="#ffff54">Bye, sweetie.</font>

37
00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:31.794
<font color="#ffff54">Give me a hug.</font>

38
00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:36.715
<font color="#ffff54">See you later, okay?</font>

39
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.085
<font color="#ffff54">Take good care of them.</font>

40
00:03:44.566 --> 00:03:45.566
<font color="#ffff54">Don’t worry.</font>

41
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.673
<font color="#ffff54">Yeah. Let’s see a cute smile.</font>

42
00:04:41.962 --> 00:04:46.087
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s fix something.
Your hair like this.</font>

43
00:04:46.805 --> 00:04:49.787
<font color="#ffff54">Yeah, you look like a star.</font>

44
00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.114
He's in.

45
00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:25.273
He's uploading.

46
00:09:25.495 --> 00:09:26.949
If he logs out

47
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.253
we can kiss the max
sentence goodbye.

48
00:11:31.287 --> 00:11:32.822
It's messed up world, man.

49
00:11:32.855 --> 00:11:34.517
You know, I've been to a lot

50
00:11:34.518 --> 00:11:35.719
of murder scenes.

51
00:11:38.728 --> 00:11:40.129
This shit's different.

52
00:11:42.298 --> 00:11:44.200
Like, as soon as I lay down

53
00:11:46.202 --> 00:11:48.137
all I see are those kids faces.

54
00:11:57.647 --> 00:11:59.816
I don't think I can
do this job. Tim.

55
00:12:01.085 --> 00:12:02.118
Let me ask you something.

56
00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:04.787
How many pedophiles, you caught?

57
00:12:05.555 --> 00:12:06.789
As of today,

58
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.954
288, not so bad.

59
00:12:11.127 --> 00:12:13.262
How many kids you found?

60
00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.834
It is a high probability

61
00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:21.304
that most of those kids are
outside of the US, Chris.

62
00:12:22.238 --> 00:12:24.641
So our job,

63
00:12:25.441 --> 00:12:27.210
is to get the pedophiles.

64
00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:29.345
And that's it?

65
00:12:33.383 --> 00:12:34.817
It's a messed up world, right

66
00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:10.717
Hello, Mr. Oshinsky

67
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.552
I'm Agent Ballard.

68
00:14:17.087 --> 00:14:18.922
I'm in charge of your case.

69
00:14:22.725 --> 00:14:24.928
Everybody's gone
home for the weekend,

70
00:14:25.103 --> 00:14:29.032
So it's just the two of us.

71
00:14:33.203 --> 00:14:35.571
How about we grab
some fresh air?

72
00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:39.042
Come on, put your shoes on.

73
00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:21.400
I really feel
connected to you.

74
00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:27.034
Like maybe you'll understand.

75
00:15:31.561 --> 00:15:33.030
But I need to know.

76
00:15:34.794 --> 00:15:36.161
Can I trust you?

77
00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:44.699
See, part of my job,

78
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.777
is looking

79
00:15:49.445 --> 00:15:50.880
at everything.

80
00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:56.241
You tell me how I'm
supposed to gaze

81
00:15:56.242 --> 00:15:57.610
at so much beauty,

82
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:00.945
without...

83
00:16:02.824 --> 00:16:04.025
being drawn to it?

84
00:16:05.595 --> 00:16:07.164
Without wanting it.

85
00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:09.500
You want me to believe
you're one of us?

86
00:16:13.565 --> 00:16:15.367
You think I'm that stupid?

87
00:16:15.369 --> 00:16:17.571
"Only the courageous act.

88
00:16:18.106 --> 00:16:19.607
The rest are tyrannized

89
00:16:19.751 --> 00:16:22.054
by a legal system,
made by cowardly men

90
00:16:22.055 --> 00:16:23.957
who cannot admit
their true desires."

91
00:16:24.576 --> 00:16:25.712
End quote.

92
00:16:28.164 --> 00:16:29.699
So what?

93
00:16:30.163 --> 00:16:31.430
You read my book.

94
00:16:31.464 --> 00:16:33.299
I studied your book

95
00:17:51.585 --> 00:17:53.142
Daddy's home!

96
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.869
Okay, everybody. Come on.

97
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.060
You gotta clear your plates now.

98
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.160
You're gonna be late.
Let's go. Come on.

99
00:18:18.977 --> 00:18:20.444
Are you okay?

100
00:18:36.525 --> 00:18:37.831
Come on, Tim.

101
00:18:37.832 --> 00:18:39.132
What's going on?

102
00:18:49.127 --> 00:18:50.828
Just give me a week,

103
00:18:51.359 --> 00:18:52.559
please.

104
00:18:53.853 --> 00:18:55.454
That's all I'm asking.

105
00:19:00.949 --> 00:19:02.050
One week.

106
00:19:05.898 --> 00:19:07.532
Mr. Oshinsky...

107
00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:11.763
Time to go home.

108
00:19:45.722 --> 00:19:47.824
Bottom line, they've got you.

109
00:19:49.053 --> 00:19:51.355
20 to 30, conservative.

110
00:19:52.644 --> 00:19:54.278
But here's the thing...

111
00:19:55.539 --> 00:19:57.875
Whatever they build
up against you...

112
00:19:58.973 --> 00:20:00.641
I'll knock down.

113
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:03.186
That's my job.

114
00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.744
But...

115
00:20:12.016 --> 00:20:13.751
here's the thing I need...

116
00:20:20.392 --> 00:20:21.761
I need a real one.

117
00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:26.208
I don't act on my fantasies.

118
00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:28.546
What about that trip
you took last year?

119
00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:32.003
The one out of Cartagena?

120
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.288
The "Butterfly Cruise".

121
00:20:39.469 --> 00:20:41.204
Come on.

122
00:20:46.192 --> 00:20:48.393
I need this, my friend.

123
00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:51.985
Almost as bad as you do.

124
00:21:25.581 --> 00:21:27.783
But I already have three copies.

125
00:21:27.886 --> 00:21:29.054
Not like this.

126
00:21:29.142 --> 00:21:31.243
There's an inscription
on the inside.

127
00:21:31.244 --> 00:21:32.680
Just for you.

128
00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:40.371
"To the bravest man I know.

129
00:21:41.878 --> 00:21:44.046
Though I didn't know
it at the time."

130
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.704
So Sweet.

131
00:21:45.797 --> 00:21:46.997
Flip the page.

132
00:21:54.256 --> 00:21:56.426
His name is Teddy Bear.

133
00:22:03.411 --> 00:22:05.413
My God, he's so little.

134
00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:06.859
Yeah.

135
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.562
This time tomorrow,

136
00:22:09.192 --> 00:22:10.560
that little boy

137
00:22:10.578 --> 00:22:13.514
is gonna be yours for
the whole weekend.

138
00:22:19.596 --> 00:22:20.964
"Better a millstone

139
00:22:22.749 --> 00:22:24.283
be hung around your neck

140
00:22:25.822 --> 00:22:27.958
and you be cast into the sea

141
00:22:28.068 --> 00:22:29.335
than that you should

142
00:22:29.336 --> 00:22:31.905
ever hurt for one of
these little ones."

143
00:22:31.906 --> 00:22:33.884
What does that mean?

144
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:45.454

crimes against children.

Is there some kind
of problem officer?

158
00:24:28.828 --> 00:24:32.165
Oh, yeah, that...
that's an old picture.

159
00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:34.487
You know kids are these days.

160
00:24:34.488 --> 00:24:37.334
They just grow up so fast.

161
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:47.520
That's him.

162
00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:49.690
No, no, no, I'm his uncle.

163
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.645
I'm his uncle, you just ask him

164
00:25:01.663 --> 00:25:02.538
<font color="#ffff54">Hello.</font>

165
00:25:05.485 --> 00:25:06.694
<font color="#ffff54">What’s your name?</font>

166
00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:13.628
<font color="#ffff54">Teddy Bear.</font>

167
00:25:23.464 --> 00:25:25.006
<font color="#ffff54">No, not that name.</font>

168
00:25:27.141 --> 00:25:28.891
<font color="#ffff54">Your real name.</font>

171
00:25:45.194 --> 00:25:46.944
<font color="#ffff54">Nice to meet you, Miguel.</font>

172
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.527
<font color="#ffff54">Come with me.</font>

173
00:26:01.879 --> 00:26:03.614
Why don't you go
right over there?

174
00:26:03.615 --> 00:26:05.283
Okay?

175
00:26:09.466 --> 00:26:11.975
He has lacerations

176
00:26:11.976 --> 00:26:15.053
consistent with sexual abuse.

177
00:26:15.054 --> 00:26:17.824
It's only three
or four days old.

178
00:26:26.868 --> 00:26:28.118
<font color="#ffff54">That’s a Mustang.</font>

179
00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:31.068
<font color="#ffff54">That’s a very fast car.</font>

180
00:26:36.074 --> 00:26:37.282
<font color="#ffff54">I’m hungry.</font>

181
00:26:39.644 --> 00:26:41.519
<font color="#ffff54">Wanna get a burger?</font>

182
00:26:44.751 --> 00:26:46.386
 <font color="#ffff54">Let me guess.</font>

183
00:26:46.387 --> 00:26:50.262
<font color="#ffff54">You’re seven and a half.</font>

184
00:26:52.934 --> 00:26:54.017
<font color="#ffff54">Is it April?</font>

185
00:26:54.407 --> 00:26:57.699
<font color="#ffff54">No. It’s July. July 12. Why?</font>

186
00:27:00.764 --> 00:27:02.555
<font color="#ffff54">Then I’m eight.</font>

187
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.738
<font color="#ffff54">I’ve got a son just your age.</font>

188
00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:17.217
<font color="#ffff54">His name’s Kalen.</font>

189
00:27:18.582 --> 00:27:19.749
<font color="#ffff54">And I’m Tim.</font>

190
00:27:20.886 --> 00:27:21.844
<font color="#ffff54">Tim Ballard.</font>

191
00:27:22.931 --> 00:27:26.598
<font color="#ffff54">But you can call me Timoteo.</font>

192
00:27:29.015 --> 00:27:30.223
<font color="#ffff54">Timoteo?</font>

193
00:27:31.972 --> 00:27:34.139
<font color="#ffff54">That’s my name in
Spanish, right?</font>

194
00:27:48.391 --> 00:27:50.016
<font color="#ffff54">It has your name on it.</font>

195
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.405
<font color="#ffff54">My sister gave it to me.</font>

196
00:27:59.095 --> 00:28:01.220
<font color="#ffff54">You rescue children, right?</font>

197
00:28:02.751 --> 00:28:06.876
<font color="#ffff54">Maybe you can help me find her.</font>

198
00:28:13.656 --> 00:28:15.240
<font color="#ffff54">Where is your sister?</font>

199
00:28:20.855 --> 00:28:23.855
<font color="#ffff54">The beach is the perfect
spot for a photo shoot.</font>

200
00:28:24.639 --> 00:28:25.930
<font color="#ffff54">You like the beach, right?</font>

201
00:28:26.488 --> 00:28:27.780
<font color="#ffff54">Yes!</font>

202
00:28:28.477 --> 00:28:30.686
<font color="#ffff54">Simba? What’s wrong?</font>

203
00:28:32.225 --> 00:28:33.725
<font color="#ffff54">My name is not Simba.</font>

204
00:28:34.227 --> 00:28:36.311
<font color="#ffff54">Well… From now on, it is.</font>

205
00:28:36.951 --> 00:28:39.576
<font color="#ffff54">Ma’am? But my papa doesn’t know.</font>

206
00:28:42.563 --> 00:28:44.063
<font color="#ffff54">Your papa knows.</font>

207
00:29:19.707 --> 00:29:21.499
<font color="#ffff54">On your feet. Come
down, come down.</font>

208
00:29:22.071 --> 00:29:23.168
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>

209
00:29:24.985 --> 00:29:25.918
<font color="#ffff54">Go.</font>

210
00:29:26.803 --> 00:29:30.178
<font color="#ffff54">Go, go. Go inside!</font>

211
00:29:30.425 --> 00:29:34.258
<font color="#ffff54">No! Where are you taking
us? Please, take us home!</font>

212
00:29:34.344 --> 00:29:36.928
<font color="#ffff54">Shut up or you’ll get a beating.</font>

213
00:29:37.118 --> 00:29:39.997
Help us, please. <font color="#ffff54">No,
please! Help us, please.</font>

214
00:29:53.402 --> 00:29:55.585
<font color="#ffff54">Help! Please!</font>

215
00:29:55.774 --> 00:29:58.649
<font color="#ffff54">Help! Please!</font>

216
00:29:59.559 --> 00:30:00.976
<font color="#ffff54">Get us out of here!</font>

217
00:30:56.613 --> 00:30:58.363
<font color="#ffff54">And where did they take you?</font>

218
00:31:11.485 --> 00:31:12.610
<font color="#ffff54">What do you see?</font>

219
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.355
<font color="#ffff54">Four men.</font>

220
00:31:15.045 --> 00:31:16.586
<font color="#ffff54">Are they nice men?</font>

221
00:31:25.183 --> 00:31:28.266
<font color="#ffff54">Why are you giving me
this? Dad gave it to you.</font>

222
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.217
<font color="#ffff54">It’s yours now. Don’t lose it.</font>

223
00:31:40.628 --> 00:31:43.378
<font color="#ffff54">Stand up! Get in a line! Now!</font>

224
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:49.882
<font color="#ffff54">Stand up! Come here!
In line, standing up.</font>

225
00:31:54.685 --> 00:31:58.023
They're ready Amigo, you pick.

226
00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:14.791
That one there.

227
00:32:14.792 --> 00:32:15.310
Okay.

228
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:16.625
No! No! No!

229
00:32:16.626 --> 00:32:17.792
<font color="#ffff54">- Come.
- No.</font>

230
00:32:17.793 --> 00:32:20.543
<font color="#ffff54">- Don’t take him! No!
- Come, come, come!</font>

231
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.765
These are good for
when he wake up.

232
00:32:37.807 --> 00:32:41.691
Alright now, Fuego.
Don't party too much.

233
00:33:16.785 --> 00:33:17.702
<font color="#ffff54">Want another one?</font>

234
00:33:22.351 --> 00:33:24.142
<font color="#ffff54">Here’s the deal:</font>

235
00:33:29.354 --> 00:33:34.021
<font color="#ffff54">I can help you, but you
need to help me too.</font>

236
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:37.081
<font color="#ffff54">If you don’t help me,</font>

237
00:33:37.886 --> 00:33:39.636
<font color="#ffff54">the bad men...</font>

238
00:33:40.527 --> 00:33:44.402
<font color="#ffff54">will find out and they
will kill your sister.</font>

239
00:33:45.446 --> 00:33:47.696
<font color="#ffff54">No, no, don’t worry.</font>

240
00:33:48.673 --> 00:33:52.382
<font color="#ffff54">Just do what I say,</font>

241
00:33:53.235 --> 00:33:56.110
<font color="#ffff54">and your sister will be fine.</font>

242
00:33:58.027 --> 00:34:03.110
<font color="#ffff54">Promise me you’ll do
whatever I tell you.</font>

243
00:34:05.285 --> 00:34:06.077
<font color="#ffff54">Okay?</font>

244
00:34:08.282 --> 00:34:09.741
<font color="#ffff54">Come on, eat, eat up.</font>

245
00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:11.741
<font color="#ffff54">Eat, eat.</font>

246
00:34:15.894 --> 00:34:19.144
<font color="#ffff54">Ever flown in an airplane?</font>

247
00:34:19.456 --> 00:34:20.424
No? <font color="#ffff54">No?</font>

248
00:34:23.501 --> 00:34:25.918
<font color="#ffff54">Captain Miguel, with the stars.</font>

249
00:34:30.999 --> 00:34:32.399
You gonna love it.

250
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.850
You just gonna really love it.

251
00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:12.523
<font color="#ffff54">Teddy Bear.</font>

252
00:35:14.578 --> 00:35:15.703
<font color="#ffff54">Do you like it?</font>

253
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:18.959
<font color="#ffff54">“Teddy Bear.”</font>

254
00:35:21.147 --> 00:35:25.813
<font color="#ffff54">Teddy Bear. I like it. We’re
gonna call you Teddy Bear.</font>

255
00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:29.688
<font color="#ffff54">How long you were with her?</font>

256
00:35:32.649 --> 00:35:34.441
<font color="#ffff54">A week? A month?</font>

257
00:35:37.438 --> 00:35:38.813
<font color="#ffff54">A long time...</font>

258
00:35:44.149 --> 00:35:45.524
<font color="#ffff54">Mister Timoteo?</font>

259
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.472
<font color="#ffff54">Yes?</font>

260
00:35:48.358 --> 00:35:50.608
<font color="#ffff54">Will they hurt my sister now?</font>

261
00:35:58.194 --> 00:35:59.444
<font color="#ffff54">I promise...</font>

262
00:36:00.363 --> 00:36:03.988
<font color="#ffff54">they will never find
out what you told me.</font>

263
00:36:05.566 --> 00:36:06.774
<font color="#ffff54">I promise.</font>

264
00:36:59.574 --> 00:37:01.616
<font color="#ffff54">We don’t know for certain,</font>

265
00:37:02.312 --> 00:37:06.396
<font color="#ffff54">but we think he spent about...</font>

266
00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.725
<font color="#ffff54">three months in Tijuana.</font>

267
00:37:19.585 --> 00:37:20.751
<font color="#ffff54">You’re a father.</font>

268
00:37:21.756 --> 00:37:22.631
<font color="#ffff54">Yes.</font>

269
00:37:25.706 --> 00:37:26.748
<font color="#ffff54">May I?</font>

270
00:37:41.803 --> 00:37:45.386
<font color="#ffff54">Could you sleep at night knowing
that one of your children’s beds...</font>

271
00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:47.839
<font color="#ffff54">is empty?</font>

272
00:38:04.924 --> 00:38:06.926
She's just Miranda's age.

273
00:38:10.397 --> 00:38:13.433
Imagine walking into
her room right now...

274
00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:17.260
Seeing an empty bed.

275
00:38:20.003 --> 00:38:22.371
What would we do?

276
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.057
<font color="#ffff54">Please keep this.</font>

277
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.457
<font color="#ffff54">No, it’s yours.</font>

278
00:38:48.006 --> 00:38:49.047
<font color="#ffff54">Please.</font>

279
00:39:39.636 --> 00:39:41.605
You're gonna rot in jail, Earl,

280
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.686
the only question is which one?

281
00:39:45.569 --> 00:39:47.338
And normally I'd
extradite your ass

282
00:39:47.339 --> 00:39:48.708
straight to Colombia.

283
00:39:50.028 --> 00:39:53.598
There you'd be raped every day,

284
00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:55.973
have your balls cut off.

285
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.390
Which quite frankly you deserve.

286
00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:00.426
Or you can tell me
what I need to know,

287
00:40:00.427 --> 00:40:02.834
and stay in the U.S.

288
00:40:05.804 --> 00:40:07.773
Get this to our embassy
in Columbia as soon as

289
00:40:07.774 --> 00:40:09.943
possible and set me up
for another call with

290
00:40:09.944 --> 00:40:10.944
the national police.

291
00:40:10.945 --> 00:40:11.467
Got it.

292
00:40:11.468 --> 00:40:15.326
Captain Jorge? I'm good,
thank you. Hey, I...

293
00:41:53.503 --> 00:41:56.973
♪ na, na, na, na ♪

294
00:41:57.747 --> 00:42:00.750
♪ na, na, na, na

295
00:42:02.087 --> 00:42:04.255
♪ na, na, na...

296
00:42:18.403 --> 00:42:20.839
Rocio Aguilar.

297
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:23.522
The boy's sister.

298
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.644
Now pull-up on the
reins here, son...

299
00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:30.749
we're going to hand this
case to the prosecution,

300
00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:32.984
and we're gonna let the
Colombians mop-up Colombia.

301
00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.086
Which means she'll
disappear, sir.

302
00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.488
For good.

303
00:42:36.955 --> 00:42:38.289
We're Homeland Security,

304
00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:39.457
you know we can't
go off rescuing

305
00:42:39.457 --> 00:42:41.493
Honduran kids in Colombia.

306
00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:44.107
Look, the boy's back
with his father...

307
00:42:44.108 --> 00:42:46.600
that's a career-capper,
take it and move on.

308
00:42:59.696 --> 00:43:00.697
I can't.

309
00:43:02.933 --> 00:43:03.725
I don't...

310
00:43:03.726 --> 00:43:05.694
think you understand
what I'm asking you.

311
00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:09.974
See ah...

312
00:43:14.192 --> 00:43:18.062
This job tears you to pieces.

313
00:43:18.859 --> 00:43:20.627
And this is...

314
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:26.471
my one chance to put those
pieces back together.

315
00:43:32.777 --> 00:43:34.979
I suppose I could
tell DC that you're...

316
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.616
You're going down there to
have a "training seminar".

317
00:43:40.118 --> 00:43:42.520
Fund it out of discretionary.

318
00:43:43.397 --> 00:43:44.965
Keep it under ten grand.

319
00:43:46.495 --> 00:43:48.296
Honey...

320
00:44:04.885 --> 00:44:06.420
Hey...

321
00:44:10.336 --> 00:44:12.072
Welcome to Cartagena.

322
00:44:12.073 --> 00:44:13.640
Mucho gusto. <font color="#ffff54">Nice to meet you.</font>

323
00:44:55.405 --> 00:44:59.177
So, I took the liberty
of sending your report

324
00:44:59.178 --> 00:45:00.880
to a "non-police" type.

325
00:45:00.881 --> 00:45:02.883
And he came back with a lead.

326
00:45:03.616 --> 00:45:05.527
Welcome to his office.

327
00:45:19.303 --> 00:45:22.001
<font color="#ffff54">Hey, Mami! Keep an
eye on my Ferrari.</font>

328
00:45:22.002 --> 00:45:24.238
<font color="#ffff54">Okay.</font>

329
00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:34.043
There are two things you
should know about Vampiro.

330
00:45:34.555 --> 00:45:37.192
He ran the Cali cartel's
money-laundering operations

331
00:45:37.193 --> 00:45:38.461
in the nineties.

332
00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:40.818
He did time in prison.

333
00:45:42.577 --> 00:45:46.043
And the second thing:
He buys children.

334
00:45:48.369 --> 00:45:50.772
And then he sets them free.

335
00:45:51.757 --> 00:45:54.459
He puts these kids
in safe houses.

336
00:45:55.225 --> 00:45:58.594
He gives them a
new chance at life.

337
00:46:01.654 --> 00:46:03.389
Vampiro!

338
00:46:10.105 --> 00:46:12.174
Some ground-rules, Timoteo.

339
00:46:12.588 --> 00:46:15.457
Don't ever step into my
office again looking like

340
00:46:15.458 --> 00:46:16.859
you just walked
out of a friggin'

341
00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.476
Banana Republic ad.

342
00:46:18.732 --> 00:46:19.500
Hm?

343
00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.755
Save that for Bogotá, man.

344
00:46:22.087 --> 00:46:23.554
This is Cartagena.

345
00:46:23.555 --> 00:46:25.790
It's a beach town, a party town.

346
00:46:26.311 --> 00:46:27.546
Lighten up.

347
00:46:28.294 --> 00:46:29.329
Jorge,

348
00:46:29.683 --> 00:46:31.852
guy's down here looking
for a little pedo-action,

349
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:33.029
what's he wear?

350
00:46:33.833 --> 00:46:35.869
Chancletas, flip-flops, T-shirt.

351
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:38.138
Exactly. What I need to see

352
00:46:38.391 --> 00:46:40.960
is some horny hung-over
rich American,

353
00:46:40.961 --> 00:46:42.329
stinking of beer,

354
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:45.333
crawling out of a big
honking automobile.

355
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.905
Rent something obnoxious.

356
00:46:47.987 --> 00:46:49.754
And black.

357
00:46:51.183 --> 00:46:53.718
And now Timoteo, the kid.

358
00:46:53.719 --> 00:46:54.520
Miguel.

359
00:46:54.725 --> 00:46:56.627
He's back with his father, huh?

360
00:46:56.628 --> 00:46:57.629
Yes.

361
00:46:58.592 --> 00:47:00.293
How did that make you feel?

362
00:47:00.854 --> 00:47:02.889
Giving a child his freedom?

363
00:47:03.543 --> 00:47:04.811
Felt good.

364
00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:08.190
Like, "back-rub" good,
or "chicken-wings" good?

365
00:47:08.191 --> 00:47:10.379
What kind of good are
we talking about here?

366
00:47:11.671 --> 00:47:13.240
The kind that gives hope.

367
00:47:13.241 --> 00:47:15.109
Come on, amigo.

368
00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:18.312
You've been at
this for 12 years.

369
00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:21.512
Why are you doing it?

370
00:47:26.664 --> 00:47:29.795
Because God's children
are not for sale.

371
00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:42.722
That is why I am giving
you my Friday night.

372
00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:47.210
And the plan unfolds.

373
00:47:52.375 --> 00:47:54.946
Now the sister, the pretty one,

374
00:47:55.481 --> 00:47:56.316
What's her name?

375
00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:57.251
Rocio.

376
00:47:57.315 --> 00:47:58.383
As of this moment,

377
00:47:58.384 --> 00:47:59.552
she could be a
block down the road,

378
00:47:59.553 --> 00:48:03.758
or she could be in
Moscow, Bangkok, L.A.

379
00:48:04.425 --> 00:48:05.928
And yes,

380
00:48:06.413 --> 00:48:09.516
I do know an young
attractive woman

381
00:48:09.517 --> 00:48:11.020
who matches your "Giselle".

382
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.504
Major operator,
runs 10, 15 kids.

383
00:48:15.545 --> 00:48:17.714
Sources her children
out of Central America,

384
00:48:17.715 --> 00:48:20.674
so she doesn't have to deal
with the Colombian cops.

385
00:48:20.675 --> 00:48:22.535
Lures them in with her looks,

386
00:48:22.536 --> 00:48:24.671
promises the sun and the moon...

387
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:25.808
a month later,

388
00:48:25.809 --> 00:48:28.207
they're turning five,
six tricks a night.

389
00:48:31.359 --> 00:48:33.628
You got a photo?

390
00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:36.154
That's the easy part.

391
00:48:36.982 --> 00:48:38.917
Meet Miss Cartagena.

392
00:48:39.495 --> 00:48:41.730
A verifiable beauty queen.

393
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.411
Her name's Katty Juarez.

394
00:48:44.594 --> 00:48:45.896
She's clean,

395
00:48:45.897 --> 00:48:48.256
not even a parking ticket
in the colonial area.

396
00:48:48.257 --> 00:48:51.879
No record of leaving
Colombia since she was 12.

397
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.649
Set me up on a date.

398
00:48:53.984 --> 00:48:57.553
Tell Miss Cartagena

399
00:48:57.652 --> 00:48:59.762
you got a horny,
hung-over, rich, American

400
00:48:59.763 --> 00:49:01.818
looking for a
little pedo-action.

401
00:49:01.819 --> 00:49:05.422
You don't just set up a
date with Katty Juarez.

402
00:49:06.199 --> 00:49:08.500
She only deals with
street traffickers,

403
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:10.670
people she knows, old friends.

404
00:49:10.671 --> 00:49:12.807
She keeps her nails very clean.

405
00:49:13.643 --> 00:49:17.380
That is a tough marlin to hook.

406
00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:37.731
AMERICAN EXECUTIVE RAN
CHILD SEX CLUB IN THAILAND

407
00:49:44.909 --> 00:49:48.012
Guy was making close to a
quarter million a month.

408
00:49:50.448 --> 00:49:53.551
You said that Katie has about
15-20 kids, right? <font color="#ffff54">Who’s this?</font>

409
00:49:53.566 --> 00:49:55.707
Scattered all over Cartagena?

410
00:49:55.708 --> 00:49:58.691
Probably some in Cali, Medellin?

411
00:49:59.212 --> 00:50:00.312
Timoteo?

412
00:50:00.313 --> 00:50:03.201
So Rocio could be anywhere.

413
00:50:03.202 --> 00:50:06.037
But what if we needed
all those kids?

414
00:50:06.054 --> 00:50:07.770
I don't understand, amigo.
<font color="#ffff54">I don’t understand, amigo.</font>

415
00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.785
You ever heard of Club Bangkok?

416
00:50:09.786 --> 00:50:12.056
It's a members-only club
full of rich perverts,

417
00:50:12.057 --> 00:50:14.626
jet-setters, CEO's. It's
a high-end facility,

418
00:50:14.627 --> 00:50:17.463
stocked 24/7 with
a hundred kids.

419
00:50:17.464 --> 00:50:19.059
And who supplied them?

420
00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.361
A bunch of sex traffickers
who got greedy.

421
00:50:21.728 --> 00:50:23.428
If they can build one in Bangkok

422
00:50:23.429 --> 00:50:25.865
why can't we build one here?

423
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.034
You wanna build a
high-end sex hotel?

424
00:50:31.035 --> 00:50:31.800
Yes I do.

425
00:50:31.801 --> 00:50:33.807
And I found just
the right investor.

426
00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:43.723
Pablo Delgado... runs
a four billion dollar

427
00:50:43.724 --> 00:50:45.861
real estate development
company, with holdings

428
00:50:45.862 --> 00:50:46.963
all over the world.

429
00:50:47.083 --> 00:50:48.417
He loves to play cop.

430
00:50:48.576 --> 00:50:51.113
We've already used him
on two separate missions,

431
00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:52.488
he eats this stuff up.

432
00:50:52.489 --> 00:50:54.525
That's the look, my friend.

433
00:50:54.954 --> 00:50:57.388
And he can build a sex hotel

434
00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.929
anywhere he wants.

435
00:51:00.241 --> 00:51:02.376
You know someone who can
bring a deal like this

436
00:51:02.377 --> 00:51:04.446
to the marketplace?

437
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:13.634
Hello, pretty. <font color="#ffff54">Hi,
love.</font> <font color="#ffff54">Hello, pretty.</font>

438
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:15.930
Calacas! <font color="#ffff54">Calacas!</font>

439
00:51:17.644 --> 00:51:19.411
Vampiro! <font color="#ffff54">Vampiro!</font>

440
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.449
Where is your horny friend?

441
00:51:25.744 --> 00:51:27.045
Change of plans.

442
00:51:27.294 --> 00:51:28.495
Put on a bow tie.

443
00:51:28.496 --> 00:51:30.700
We're going to the
classy part of town.

444
00:51:35.866 --> 00:51:37.616
<font color="#ffff54">This is sweet.</font>

445
00:51:38.807 --> 00:51:40.374
Like the old days.

446
00:51:44.462 --> 00:51:49.746
Wow! This guy
knows how to party.

447
00:51:54.875 --> 00:51:56.342
That's it, amigo.

448
00:51:56.343 --> 00:51:58.457
No more aguardiente.

449
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.170
I think I may have
to expand your mind

450
00:52:10.245 --> 00:52:12.680
to an entirely new reality.

451
00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.420
Okay.

452
00:52:16.135 --> 00:52:18.537
These gentlemen want to build

453
00:52:18.538 --> 00:52:19.914
a one of a kind,

454
00:52:19.915 --> 00:52:22.851
members-only club
near Cartagena.

455
00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.975
Annual fee:

456
00:52:25.704 --> 00:52:28.439
one hundred grand per member.

457
00:52:28.621 --> 00:52:30.723
They take care of the facility

458
00:52:30.788 --> 00:52:32.623
we take care of the talent.

459
00:52:32.708 --> 00:52:34.466
And the members,

460
00:52:34.467 --> 00:52:36.837
they get a world-class resort

461
00:52:36.838 --> 00:52:40.340
with full access
to models, 24/7,

462
00:52:40.373 --> 00:52:42.274
all-you-can-eat.

463
00:52:42.784 --> 00:52:46.444
Live-in models. Young ones.

464
00:52:46.445 --> 00:52:47.480
How young?

465
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:50.081
Shock me.

466
00:52:51.777 --> 00:52:52.978
Which one is this?

467
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.050
El Calacas.

468
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:58.643
He used to deliver
escorts for Escobar.

469
00:52:59.275 --> 00:53:01.612
He sold me a chicken last year,

470
00:53:01.879 --> 00:53:03.614
9 years old.

471
00:53:03.615 --> 00:53:06.016
And she was...

472
00:53:07.649 --> 00:53:12.553
Nine legit or a 15
year-old with pigtails?

473
00:53:12.743 --> 00:53:15.245
I deal in pure cocaine, papi...

474
00:53:15.648 --> 00:53:19.018
So how many chickens
do you want?

475
00:53:19.143 --> 00:53:20.679
For starters,

476
00:53:21.609 --> 00:53:23.544
50 or 60.

477
00:53:26.839 --> 00:53:28.206
Minimum.

478
00:53:28.824 --> 00:53:32.160
Go big or go home. Right?

479
00:53:35.014 --> 00:53:38.283
I think your amigo ate the worm.

480
00:53:39.284 --> 00:53:41.844
I think he just sobered up.

481
00:53:45.908 --> 00:53:49.077
That's a lot of chickens, papi.

482
00:53:49.873 --> 00:53:52.375
No one can do that alone.

483
00:53:55.501 --> 00:53:58.604
I'm not asking you if
you can do it alone.

484
00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:02.475
I'm just asking
if you can do it.

485
00:55:12.678 --> 00:55:15.147
plus five support agents
for a month in-country,

486
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:16.549
the penthouse in Bogota,

487
00:55:16.582 --> 00:55:19.185
the mansion in
Cartagena, on and on,

488
00:55:19.186 --> 00:55:20.789
and yet somehow...

489
00:55:20.856 --> 00:55:22.491
somehow, you have
failed to bring me

490
00:55:22.492 --> 00:55:24.193
one real-world lead,

491
00:55:24.194 --> 00:55:26.731
or one American child, or
one American trafficker,

492
00:55:26.732 --> 00:55:29.034
or one reason DC would
let you within a million

493
00:55:29.098 --> 00:55:30.967
miles of this, and a
bunch of glamor shots

494
00:55:30.968 --> 00:55:32.670
of Miss Cartagena don't count!

495
00:55:32.671 --> 00:55:34.051
She has the girl.

496
00:55:34.052 --> 00:55:35.253
And I say the girl is in Russia.

497
00:55:35.254 --> 00:55:36.889
Prove me wrong.

498
00:55:43.658 --> 00:55:45.426
It's over, Tim.

499
00:55:46.112 --> 00:55:47.747
Close up,

500
00:55:48.216 --> 00:55:50.329
get on a plane and

501
00:55:50.330 --> 00:55:52.499
come back home.

502
00:56:00.906 --> 00:56:03.442
Bureaucracy is shit.

503
00:56:04.915 --> 00:56:08.485
This is why I operate black.

504
00:56:17.002 --> 00:56:19.371
Have a nice flight, Timoteo.

505
00:56:22.019 --> 00:56:23.788
You were a cartel guy...

506
00:56:25.417 --> 00:56:26.886
Yeah.

507
00:56:29.249 --> 00:56:31.386
Kept your mouth
shut, did your time.

508
00:56:31.891 --> 00:56:34.627
Could've picked up
where you left off,

509
00:56:35.232 --> 00:56:37.769
bought yourself a
condo on the beach.

510
00:56:40.237 --> 00:56:43.575
Instead you're
doing this. Why?

511
00:56:44.612 --> 00:56:45.847
Really?

512
00:57:07.244 --> 00:57:09.814
I had that condo on the beach.

513
00:57:10.983 --> 00:57:13.285
Fifteenth floor,
marble everything,

514
00:57:13.286 --> 00:57:15.521
overlooking the whole bay.

515
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:19.807
First night out of jail
I slept in my own bed.

516
00:57:20.725 --> 00:57:23.161
Day two, I was back in business,

517
00:57:23.162 --> 00:57:25.030
same old life.

518
00:57:25.409 --> 00:57:29.046
But it doesn't feel right...

519
00:57:29.258 --> 00:57:31.326
not the drugs, not the hookers.

520
00:57:31.327 --> 00:57:35.331
But dammit if I
didn't keep trying...

521
00:57:38.619 --> 00:57:40.621
So one night

522
00:57:42.849 --> 00:57:45.619
I'm leaving a bar
all jacked up on coca

523
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:49.858
and I notice this young
girl on the corner.

524
00:57:50.038 --> 00:57:53.109
Fine looking, maybe 20, 25.

525
00:57:54.305 --> 00:57:57.675
I take her up to my place,
do the deed, pay the bill.

526
00:57:58.121 --> 00:58:00.123
She's putting on her shoes,

527
00:58:00.819 --> 00:58:02.588
and I notice something.

528
00:58:05.107 --> 00:58:06.976
I notice her foot.

529
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.095
She's got these little

530
00:58:10.368 --> 00:58:14.338
pink cat faces painted
on her toenails.

531
00:58:16.214 --> 00:58:17.917
And it hit me.

532
00:58:18.366 --> 00:58:20.134
She's not 25.

533
00:58:23.368 --> 00:58:26.605
Then she glances up
and our eyes connect.

534
00:58:27.936 --> 00:58:28.970
And

535
00:58:30.116 --> 00:58:33.719
it was like I was granted
a glimpse into her soul,

536
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:40.617
and all I saw was sadness...

537
00:58:43.269 --> 00:58:45.237
Out of nowhere she
starts talking.

538
00:58:45.303 --> 00:58:48.506
Turns out she's not
25. Not even 20.

539
00:58:50.235 --> 00:58:54.306
This girl is 14
years old, Timoteo.

540
00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:59.036
She's been doing this
since she was six.

541
00:59:01.044 --> 00:59:02.446
Looks at me,

542
00:59:02.447 --> 00:59:03.381
smiles,

543
00:59:03.452 --> 00:59:04.686
takes the money,

544
00:59:04.687 --> 00:59:06.489
walks out the door.

545
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.117
All of a sudden I'm
hit by this tidal wave,

546
00:59:22.479 --> 00:59:26.216
this tsunami of darkness,

547
00:59:26.412 --> 00:59:28.014
and I know

548
00:59:28.428 --> 00:59:31.398
I'm the sadness
in her eyes. Me.

549
00:59:31.863 --> 00:59:34.499
I'm the darkness.

550
00:59:38.171 --> 00:59:39.972
And I know

551
00:59:40.783 --> 00:59:43.619
the darkness has to die.

552
00:59:47.032 --> 00:59:49.801
So I get my 45.

553
00:59:56.773 --> 00:59:58.842
Put it to my head.

554
01:00:00.342 --> 01:00:03.144
Put my finger on the trigger.

555
01:00:05.681 --> 01:00:09.928
Now if there's a time
to ask if God exists,

556
01:00:09.929 --> 01:00:12.495
that would be it.

557
01:00:23.527 --> 01:00:24.828
So I did.

558
01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:30.496
When God tells you what to do,

559
01:00:33.179 --> 01:00:35.980
you cannot hesitate.

560
01:00:58.102 --> 01:00:59.622
So you've thought of that...

561
01:01:00.332 --> 01:01:01.800
of doing it on your own?

562
01:01:02.044 --> 01:01:04.078
I won't be on my own.

563
01:01:05.047 --> 01:01:07.214
I just have to convince Pablo.

564
01:01:08.015 --> 01:01:09.683
Okay.

565
01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.563
So you quit your job

566
01:01:14.819 --> 01:01:17.388
and you go and
rescue these kids.

567
01:01:46.635 --> 01:01:48.837
My resignation's in your box.

568
01:01:49.143 --> 01:01:51.812
Wait. You do realize

569
01:01:52.255 --> 01:01:54.891
you're ten months away
from vesting your pension.

570
01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:56.779
I do.

571
01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:01.417
You know I did
everything I could,

572
01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:03.653
but the law is the law.

573
01:02:06.285 --> 01:02:08.086
Did you know that
were over 22 million

574
01:02:08.087 --> 01:02:09.556
new images of child pornography

575
01:02:09.557 --> 01:02:10.958
on the web this past year?

576
01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:13.587
That's a five thousand percent

577
01:02:13.588 --> 01:02:16.390
increase over the
past five years.

578
01:02:16.941 --> 01:02:18.843
Five thousand percent.

579
01:02:20.522 --> 01:02:21.834
The fact is

580
01:02:22.079 --> 01:02:25.108
it is the fastest growing
international crime network

581
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:26.784
that the world has ever seen.

582
01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:29.855
I agreed to it because
we were working

583
01:02:29.855 --> 01:02:31.013
with the U.S. government.

584
01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:33.233
If you back out now this
whole thing will blow!

585
01:02:33.245 --> 01:02:35.303
It has already passed
the illegal arms trade.

586
01:02:35.304 --> 01:02:37.505
And soon it's gonna
pass the drug trade.

587
01:02:37.506 --> 01:02:38.875
You Wanna know why?

588
01:02:39.025 --> 01:02:41.961
Because you can sell a
bag of cocaine one time.

589
01:02:42.631 --> 01:02:46.302
But a child, the most
precious child...

590
01:02:46.984 --> 01:02:48.885
You can sell a five year-old kid

591
01:02:49.347 --> 01:02:51.483
five to ten times a day

592
01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:54.759
for ten years straight!

593
01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.029
And everyday ordinary people

594
01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:01.910
don't want to hear it,

595
01:03:02.393 --> 01:03:05.097
it's too ugly for
polite conversation,

596
01:03:05.426 --> 01:03:07.428
but meanwhile over two
million children a year

597
01:03:07.429 --> 01:03:10.599
are being sucked into the
deepest recesses of hell.

598
01:03:10.896 --> 01:03:14.198
Trust me, man.
If we do nothing,

599
01:03:19.411 --> 01:03:21.913
their pain is gonna
spread and spread

600
01:03:22.888 --> 01:03:26.324
till some day it's gonna
reach the likes of you.

601
01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:30.324
And that will be a nightmare

602
01:03:30.552 --> 01:03:32.987
that you never
gonna wake up from.

603
01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.574
I'm sorry.

604
01:03:58.518 --> 01:04:00.221
Sir, the gentleman who just left

605
01:04:00.222 --> 01:04:01.958
asked me to give you this.

606
01:05:07.656 --> 01:05:09.691
Jorge found us a property
on Cartagena Bay.

607
01:05:09.692 --> 01:05:11.327
It's a private
island confiscated

608
01:05:11.347 --> 01:05:12.815
by the Colombian government.

609
01:05:12.816 --> 01:05:14.209
Here's some intel on that.

610
01:05:14.337 --> 01:05:16.510
The palapa will be located here.

611
01:05:16.511 --> 01:05:19.213
The traffickers will
arrive up here...

612
01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.855
So what do you think?

613
01:05:35.785 --> 01:05:38.353
2.6 Not bad, huh?

614
01:05:42.779 --> 01:05:44.999
So let's go meet him in Bogota

615
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.209
and get him excited.

616
01:06:15.714 --> 01:06:16.797
<font color="#ffff54">My love…</font>

617
01:06:17.253 --> 01:06:20.001
<font color="#ffff54">Pablo Delgado. Nice to meet you.</font>

618
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:23.550
Better?

619
01:06:23.551 --> 01:06:25.123
Too stiff.

620
01:06:25.218 --> 01:06:27.151
If you don't know what
to say, <font color="#ffff54">Loosen up!</font>

621
01:06:27.152 --> 01:06:28.576
Just don't say anything at all.

622
01:06:28.577 --> 01:06:30.288
Silence.

623
01:06:30.364 --> 01:06:32.000
Don't forget to smile.

624
01:06:32.268 --> 01:06:33.470
I forgot.

625
01:06:34.477 --> 01:06:36.960
<font color="#ffff54">Loosen up! Loosen up!</font>

626
01:06:45.521 --> 01:06:46.556
My love... <font color="#ffff54">My love…</font>

627
01:06:47.366 --> 01:06:49.199
<font color="#ffff54">Pablo Delgado. A pleasure.</font>

628
01:06:52.122 --> 01:06:53.639
Yeah. I don't know
about the kiss.

629
01:07:10.688 --> 01:07:14.558
Welcome. Beware of your heads.
<font color="#ffff54">Welcome. Beware of your heads.</font>

630
01:07:20.735 --> 01:07:24.039
My soul brother, let me
introduce Katty. <font color="#ffff54">My soul brother,</font>

631
01:07:25.063 --> 01:07:26.797
Katty, this is the
man that's gonna make

632
01:07:26.798 --> 01:07:29.434
your dreams come true. Pablo.

633
01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:30.335
<font color="#ffff54">A pleasure.</font>

634
01:07:31.513 --> 01:07:32.304
Gentlemen...

635
01:07:32.305 --> 01:07:33.539
Adolfo.

636
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.341
Adolfo.

637
01:07:36.107 --> 01:07:36.908
Don Fuego.

638
01:07:36.909 --> 01:07:37.944
Don Fuego.

639
01:07:38.183 --> 01:07:39.418
You know El Calacas.

640
01:07:39.419 --> 01:07:40.454
Extravagant. <font color="#ffff54">Extravagant.</font>

641
01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:42.626
Who would like a drink?

642
01:07:43.319 --> 01:07:44.771
We've got fourteen members

643
01:07:44.772 --> 01:07:47.162
showing up for the
"Kick-Off Party," plus

644
01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.200
a dozen prospects.

645
01:07:49.302 --> 01:07:51.939
And we would like all
our talent on site,

646
01:07:52.154 --> 01:07:55.057
rested, tested and ready to rock

647
01:07:55.058 --> 01:07:57.627
the day before the
first guest arrives.

648
01:07:57.628 --> 01:07:59.161
Absolutely.

649
01:07:59.848 --> 01:08:01.549
So

650
01:08:02.134 --> 01:08:03.903
How many can you deliver?

651
01:08:04.927 --> 01:08:06.328
You asked for 50.

652
01:08:06.797 --> 01:08:08.231
At least that,

653
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:12.562
more if you're lucky.

654
01:08:17.886 --> 01:08:19.453
Tell me, amor...

655
01:08:22.068 --> 01:08:24.403
What do you like?

656
01:08:37.688 --> 01:08:39.556
Depends on the mood.

657
01:08:41.918 --> 01:08:43.460
<font color="#ffff54">The pretty boy is horny!</font>

658
01:08:56.792 --> 01:09:00.395
Just deliver no
less than 50 models.

659
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:03.184
And you will leave the island...

660
01:09:03.521 --> 01:09:05.422
with 100 grand

661
01:09:25.403 --> 01:09:26.767
Cheers. <font color="#ffff54">Cheers, hermanos.</font>

662
01:09:26.768 --> 01:09:27.803
Cheers. <font color="#ffff54">Cheers.</font>

663
01:09:27.804 --> 01:09:28.839
Cheers.

664
01:09:33.006 --> 01:09:34.273
Ok, it's handled...

665
01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.009
you have the support of
our Embassy in Colombia,

666
01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:37.343
One of our guys
will track the raid

667
01:09:37.343 --> 01:09:39.913
in case you need
any legal back-up.

668
01:09:42.816 --> 01:09:44.350
Hey Tim,

669
01:09:46.693 --> 01:09:48.260
I hope you find her.

670
01:10:08.612 --> 01:10:09.960
 <font color="#ffff54">For you, papi.</font>

671
01:10:09.961 --> 01:10:11.418
Gracias. <font color="#ffff54">Gracias.</font>

672
01:10:14.267 --> 01:10:16.015
Negotiation is over there.

673
01:10:16.016 --> 01:10:17.450
I want the kids back here,

674
01:10:17.483 --> 01:10:20.486
as far away from the
traffickers as possible...

675
01:10:37.704 --> 01:10:39.940
They didn't bring all the kids.

676
01:10:40.272 --> 01:10:41.708
It doesn't surprise me.

677
01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.855
It gotta be less than 30.

678
01:10:48.463 --> 01:10:51.440
Let's go. Quick, so you
don't get wet. <font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>

679
01:10:51.441 --> 01:10:53.191
<font color="#ffff54">Quick, so you don’t get wet.</font>

680
01:11:06.655 --> 01:11:08.363
<font color="#ffff54">Remember, it’s a party.</font>

681
01:11:16.446 --> 01:11:18.446
<font color="#ffff54">This is beautiful.</font>

682
01:11:19.462 --> 01:11:20.965
You keeping the
rest of the talent

683
01:11:20.966 --> 01:11:22.568
in the glove compartment?

684
01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.200
They'll be here soon.

685
01:11:24.225 --> 01:11:25.391
<font color="#ffff54">I died...</font>

686
01:11:26.475 --> 01:11:28.308
<font color="#ffff54">and went to heaven.</font>

687
01:11:30.045 --> 01:11:31.753
<font color="#ffff54">This is a paradise.</font>

688
01:11:32.892 --> 01:11:34.827
Osorio Rodriguez.
<font color="#ffff54">Osorio Rodriguez.</font>

689
01:11:36.759 --> 01:11:39.662
But my friends call me Carne.

690
01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:42.999
Carne is our lawyer.

691
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.469
He got good friends
at the borders.

692
01:11:46.097 --> 01:11:48.071
<font color="#ffff54">He’s our Don King, papi.</font>

693
01:11:48.072 --> 01:11:49.845
No, no, no, no, no.

694
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:52.162
No Don King.

695
01:11:52.546 --> 01:11:55.515
I like to get in the ring.

696
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:03.437
<font color="#ffff54">Get happy. Cheer up, cheer up.</font>

697
01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.184
Tenacious. Love him.

698
01:12:18.772 --> 01:12:20.472
That's it.

699
01:13:03.835 --> 01:13:06.186
<font color="#ffff54">Excuse me. Want more?</font>

700
01:13:06.187 --> 01:13:07.624
Excuse me. Want more?

701
01:13:10.194 --> 01:13:11.427
And what's plan B?

702
01:13:12.352 --> 01:13:13.353
We wait.

703
01:13:14.276 --> 01:13:16.324
We're not gonna lose the
kids in the other boat.

704
01:13:16.324 --> 01:13:18.494
Rocio must be with them.

705
01:13:19.039 --> 01:13:20.107
Jorge, listen to me.

706
01:13:20.289 --> 01:13:21.686
When you land,

707
01:13:21.687 --> 01:13:24.523
take their fat bulldog and
get him off the island,

708
01:13:24.524 --> 01:13:28.428
keep him separate
and no handcuffs.

709
01:13:30.244 --> 01:13:34.254
No, no, no, no, no.
Sorry. He's mine.

710
01:13:35.470 --> 01:13:37.573
Choose another.

711
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:41.793
You're joking, right?

712
01:13:51.786 --> 01:13:53.755
You know where is the most

713
01:13:53.898 --> 01:13:56.434
dangerous place in Colombia?

714
01:13:58.055 --> 01:13:59.891
Between me

715
01:14:01.139 --> 01:14:03.575
and my chicken.

716
01:14:16.732 --> 01:14:18.834
You're a real big man, huh?

717
01:14:20.314 --> 01:14:22.450
I can kill you without a glance.

718
01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.616
<font color="#ffff54">Respect me, asshole!</font>

719
01:14:24.617 --> 01:14:26.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

720
01:14:29.016 --> 01:14:30.183
<font color="#ffff54">Brother…</font>

721
01:14:31.271 --> 01:14:33.974
Give the man what he wants.

722
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:45.981
Carne, tell your fathead
goon to put this gun away.

723
01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:16.883
Alright.

724
01:15:17.584 --> 01:15:18.752
Come on, guys.

725
01:15:18.785 --> 01:15:20.920
Let's have a drink, huh?

726
01:15:21.454 --> 01:15:22.689
Hey,

727
01:15:23.757 --> 01:15:26.659
you'll have all afternoon
in that damn bungalow.

728
01:15:38.265 --> 01:15:40.120
<font color="#ffff54">Now! Green light…</font>

729
01:16:16.956 --> 01:16:20.517
Hurray! Finally arrived! <font color="#ffff54">Come.</font>

730
01:16:20.526 --> 01:16:23.027
<font color="#ffff54">Hurray! Finally arrived!</font>

731
01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:28.915
<font color="#ffff54">Come, come.</font>

732
01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:36.006
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go to the party.</font>

733
01:16:54.184 --> 01:16:57.821
moves! <font color="#ffff54">Stop! Hands up!</font>

734
01:16:59.702 --> 01:17:00.819
<font color="#ffff54">Nobody moves!</font>

735
01:17:00.918 --> 01:17:03.251
<font color="#ffff54">I’m victim! I’m victim!</font>

736
01:17:05.523 --> 01:17:08.152
On the ground! On the
ground! <font color="#ffff54">Stop! Police!</font>

737
01:17:08.153 --> 01:17:10.043
<font color="#ffff54">- On the ground! On the ground!
- Calm, calm!</font>

738
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:43.857
Who set us up?

739
01:17:45.079 --> 01:17:46.314
Your Don King? <font color="#ffff54">Shut up!</font>

740
01:17:46.327 --> 01:17:48.660
<font color="#ffff54">Leave him with me.</font>

741
01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:24.812
Fifty four kids.

742
01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:29.289
Did you get their names?

743
01:18:33.668 --> 01:18:35.223
Rocio?

744
01:18:42.353 --> 01:18:44.410
I'm sorry, Tim.

745
01:18:44.838 --> 01:18:46.906
But we rescued 54.

746
01:18:47.964 --> 01:18:49.672
<font color="#ffff54">Uncuff them.</font>

747
01:19:44.122 --> 01:19:45.856
Hear that?

748
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:59.537
That's the sound of freedom.

749
01:20:12.763 --> 01:20:13.913
I hear it.

750
01:21:43.749 --> 01:21:44.707
<font color="#ffff54">Come here.</font>

751
01:21:46.803 --> 01:21:47.844
<font color="#ffff54">Come here, son.</font>

752
01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:27.313
<font color="#ffff54">Do you know what happens
to pedophiles in cell 142?</font>

753
01:22:27.746 --> 01:22:29.413
<font color="#ffff54">Just ask your friend Carne.</font>

754
01:22:29.748 --> 01:22:35.428
<font color="#ffff54">Okay, okay! Okay,
you asshole, okay!</font>

755
01:22:44.623 --> 01:22:45.706
<font color="#ffff54">Okay?</font>

756
01:22:48.254 --> 01:22:49.212
<font color="#ffff54">Okay, what?</font>

757
01:22:50.202 --> 01:22:51.785
<font color="#ffff54">Asshole, what?</font>

758
01:22:51.952 --> 01:22:53.327
<font color="#ffff54">The Scorpion.</font>

759
01:22:56.465 --> 01:22:57.366
Hm.

760
01:23:22.368 --> 01:23:24.243
<font color="#ffff54">Little princess...</font>

761
01:23:27.633 --> 01:23:30.633
<font color="#ffff54">It’s time you make
me some real money.</font>

762
01:24:40.158 --> 01:24:42.227
Fuego handed her off here.

763
01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.515
At a village on
the Guáitara River.

764
01:24:44.655 --> 01:24:48.224
South of that river,
it's all rebel territory.

765
01:24:49.813 --> 01:24:51.347
No one goes in.

766
01:24:51.643 --> 01:24:54.579
Not the army, not the police.

767
01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:56.314
Not us.

768
01:25:01.201 --> 01:25:02.368
What?

769
01:25:03.691 --> 01:25:04.892
That's it?

770
01:25:05.065 --> 01:25:06.440
You're talking about extracting

771
01:25:06.441 --> 01:25:08.711
an 11 year-old girl
from unknown terrain.

772
01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:10.005
So?

773
01:25:10.083 --> 01:25:12.151
It's controlled by
an army of rebels!

774
01:25:12.175 --> 01:25:13.076
Right.

775
01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:16.345
Forget about what
could happen to us!

776
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:18.748
She could be killed too...

777
01:25:23.596 --> 01:25:25.022
Tim.

778
01:25:27.898 --> 01:25:31.702
What if this was
your daughter, Jorge.

779
01:25:38.392 --> 01:25:41.116
Sorry, man. She's gone.

780
01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:44.971
She got sold to the wrong guy!

781
01:25:45.034 --> 01:25:48.202
Unless that guy
needs our help.

782
01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:53.795
I remember hearing
about a groups

783
01:25:53.796 --> 01:25:57.498
that could sweet-talk
their way into those areas.

784
01:25:57.537 --> 01:25:58.890
Medical folks,

785
01:25:58.891 --> 01:26:01.701
treating cholera,
malaria, dengue fever.

786
01:26:04.314 --> 01:26:05.984
Makes me wonder

787
01:26:06.150 --> 01:26:08.386
if there's any epidemics

788
01:26:08.387 --> 01:26:11.123
going around the
mountains these days.

789
01:26:22.058 --> 01:26:23.224
Put up your hand.

790
01:26:23.446 --> 01:26:24.427
What?

791
01:26:24.428 --> 01:26:26.698
I said "put up your hand".

792
01:26:34.706 --> 01:26:36.263
These gringos. <font color="#ffff54">These gringos.</font>

793
01:26:42.606 --> 01:26:44.408
Now you're a doctor.

794
01:26:44.929 --> 01:26:47.264
Moving up in life.

795
01:27:08.239 --> 01:27:09.707
Tim!

796
01:27:09.947 --> 01:27:11.782
I got orders.

797
01:27:12.114 --> 01:27:14.751
I can go as far as the river.

798
01:27:14.752 --> 01:27:16.454
No further.

799
01:27:17.186 --> 01:27:19.173
When you get on that water,

800
01:27:20.023 --> 01:27:21.758
you're on your own.

801
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:23.525
Do me a favor.

802
01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:25.389
Keep these with you.

803
01:27:28.491 --> 01:27:29.525
GPS?

804
01:27:30.463 --> 01:27:33.232
You can keep it in
your wallet or...

805
01:27:33.666 --> 01:27:36.402
I don't know, inject it.

806
01:27:43.131 --> 01:27:46.333
So you can locate
our bodies, hm?

807
01:29:00.608 --> 01:29:01.876
<font color="#ffff54">Gracias.</font>

808
01:29:11.351 --> 01:29:12.987
Hey, Timoteo...

809
01:29:18.291 --> 01:29:20.128
If things go south tomorrow,

810
01:29:20.161 --> 01:29:23.064
which is not
particularly unlikely,

811
01:29:23.598 --> 01:29:25.700
there's no Marine unit coming.

812
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.935
We're done.

813
01:30:31.658 --> 01:30:32.826
Hey.

814
01:30:33.522 --> 01:30:34.890
Take this.

815
01:30:35.897 --> 01:30:37.432
I'll feel safer.

816
01:30:38.873 --> 01:30:41.676
I think I'll be
better off without it.

817
01:31:42.530 --> 01:31:44.700
I hope we get a warm welcome.

818
01:31:46.579 --> 01:31:48.038
<font color="#ffff54">We’re doctors.</font>

819
01:31:54.458 --> 01:31:56.739
Don't shoot.
Don't... <font color="#ffff54">Don’t shoot.</font>

820
01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.514
Get down! Are you
out of your mind?

821
01:32:03.834 --> 01:32:05.584
<font color="#ffff54">We’re doctors. Don’t shoot.</font>

822
01:32:05.585 --> 01:32:08.002
<font color="#ffff54">Get down! Get down!</font>

823
01:32:08.251 --> 01:32:09.626
<font color="#ffff54">We’re doctors from
the United Nations.</font>

824
01:32:09.806 --> 01:32:11.640
<font color="#ffff54">Down, down!</font>

825
01:32:12.063 --> 01:32:14.313
<font color="#ffff54">Lay down! Don’t look at me.</font>

826
01:32:14.555 --> 01:32:16.180
<font color="#ffff54">Doctors from the United Nations.</font>

827
01:32:16.375 --> 01:32:17.792
<font color="#ffff54">Shut up!</font>

828
01:32:18.405 --> 01:32:20.363
<font color="#ffff54">Easy, easy!</font>

829
01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:31.503
<font color="#ffff54">What do they have?</font>

830
01:32:32.699 --> 01:32:34.907
<font color="#ffff54">Vaccines. They’re clean.</font>

831
01:32:40.899 --> 01:32:42.483
<font color="#ffff54">Alacran? Alacran, copy?</font>

832
01:32:44.652 --> 01:32:46.194
<font color="#ffff54">It seems they’re just vaccines.</font>

833
01:32:49.079 --> 01:32:50.246
<font color="#ffff54">Okay, boss.</font>

834
01:32:51.748 --> 01:32:53.789
<font color="#ffff54">Why the hell are
you looking at me?</font>

835
01:32:54.553 --> 01:32:56.719
<font color="#ffff54">Just one of you
will come with us.</font>

836
01:32:57.277 --> 01:32:58.277
<font color="#ffff54">Who?</font>

837
01:33:00.089 --> 01:33:01.089
<font color="#ffff54">Who?</font>

838
01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:04.953
<font color="#ffff54">- Who’s coming?
- Easy, easy.</font>

839
01:33:05.085 --> 01:33:06.502
<font color="#ffff54">Me, here.</font>

840
01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.357
<font color="#ffff54">The vaccines.</font>

841
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:22.370
<font color="#ffff54">Pass them to me.</font>

842
01:33:25.714 --> 01:33:27.073
Come on. <font color="#ffff54">Come on. Help him!</font>

843
01:33:27.917 --> 01:33:29.584
<font color="#ffff54">Yes. Easy.</font>

844
01:33:31.693 --> 01:33:34.161
If I come back in the
dark, be ready to run.

845
01:33:36.381 --> 01:33:38.547
<font color="#ffff54">What are you talking about?</font>

846
01:33:38.766 --> 01:33:40.503
<font color="#ffff54">Do you want your
ass full of lead?</font>

847
01:33:40.613 --> 01:33:41.280
<font color="#ffff54">No.</font>

848
01:33:41.306 --> 01:33:42.556
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>

849
01:33:48.588 --> 01:33:50.123
<font color="#ffff54">Let’s go.</font>

850
01:34:16.009 --> 01:34:17.242
What's happening?

851
01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:19.487
He's on his own.

852
01:36:48.759 --> 01:36:49.884
<font color="#ffff54">Boss!</font>

853
01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:51.988
<font color="#ffff54">Boss!</font>

854
01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.376
<font color="#ffff54">Keep moving.</font>

855
01:37:13.780 --> 01:37:16.520
You got some cojones
coming here, amigo.

856
01:37:19.762 --> 01:37:21.697
The cholera must be bad.

857
01:37:22.578 --> 01:37:25.081
There are cases in Leticia,

858
01:37:25.159 --> 01:37:29.462
San Gil, and it can
spread like wildfire.

859
01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:31.345
So with your permission

860
01:37:31.734 --> 01:37:34.337
I'd like to take the
rest of the evening to

861
01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.780
look for anyone

862
01:37:35.781 --> 01:37:38.684
who might need our
immediate attention.

863
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.489
If I do... God forbid...

864
01:37:41.490 --> 01:37:44.059
we'll have to evacuate
them immediately.

865
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.074
It's the only way to
make sure the cholera

866
01:37:46.075 --> 01:37:47.475
doesn't spread.

867
01:37:47.771 --> 01:37:49.007
Evacuate?

868
01:37:49.346 --> 01:37:51.849
Yes. It's just our protocol.

869
01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:53.638
Yeah, yeah.

870
01:38:01.749 --> 01:38:03.885
If you find sick people...

871
01:38:05.106 --> 01:38:06.706
God forbid...

872
01:38:06.918 --> 01:38:08.920
you bring them to me.

873
01:38:09.452 --> 01:38:11.088
My protocol.

874
01:39:49.153 --> 01:39:50.856
Rocio!

875
01:39:54.387 --> 01:39:55.880
Rocio Aguilar!

876
01:40:09.581 --> 01:40:12.245
<font color="#ffff54">I came here… I came
here to help you.</font>

877
01:40:13.427 --> 01:40:14.596
Come here.

878
01:40:19.105 --> 01:40:20.773
Oh, shit!

879
01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.582
<font color="#ffff54">You need… You need…</font>

880
01:40:24.583 --> 01:40:27.917
<font color="#ffff54">I need you to tell
me where you sleep.</font>

881
01:40:28.154 --> 01:40:29.154
<font color="#ffff54">In which house?</font>

882
01:40:29.155 --> 01:40:30.238
<font color="#ffff54">Oh look.</font>

883
01:40:31.683 --> 01:40:32.933
<font color="#ffff54">There you are.</font>

884
01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:42.776
Is this one sick?

885
01:40:42.919 --> 01:40:46.689
No, no, no. They're
fine. She's fine.

886
01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:53.069
<font color="#ffff54">Come on, come on!
Get back to work.</font>

887
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:54.592
<font color="#ffff54">Come on.</font>

888
01:41:00.178 --> 01:41:02.636
<font color="#ffff54">Take the gringo
to check my boys.</font>

889
01:41:07.949 --> 01:41:09.559
Okay.

890
01:41:12.409 --> 01:41:14.646
Ei, amigo. <font color="#ffff54">Ei, amigo.</font>

891
01:41:15.511 --> 01:41:17.161
Let's go, man.

892
01:44:09.881 --> 01:44:13.584
Rocio... Rocio. <font color="#ffff54">Rocio.</font>

893
01:44:13.585 --> 01:44:14.543
<font color="#ffff54">Rocio.</font>

894
01:44:16.756 --> 01:44:18.625
No! No! <font color="#ffff54">No! No! No!</font>

895
01:44:30.347 --> 01:44:31.222
<font color="#ffff54">Take it.</font>

896
01:44:32.428 --> 01:44:33.511
<font color="#ffff54">Take some of this.</font>

897
01:44:34.449 --> 01:44:36.889
<font color="#ffff54">This guy doesn’t know how to
play. Come on. Just take a drink.</font>

898
01:44:47.886 --> 01:44:50.136
<font color="#ffff54">I’m gonna check
on my little girl.</font>

899
01:45:00.889 --> 01:45:04.430
<font color="#ffff54">You need to do exactly
what I tell you.</font>

900
01:45:06.438 --> 01:45:08.480
<font color="#ffff54">Or they’ll kill us both.</font>

901
01:45:08.773 --> 01:45:10.148
<font color="#ffff54">Do you understand?</font>

902
01:45:42.069 --> 01:45:43.735
<font color="#ffff54">Why did you scream, my child?</font>

903
01:45:47.543 --> 01:45:48.876
<font color="#ffff54">A bad dream.</font>

904
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:53.595
<font color="#ffff54">Poor thing.</font>

905
01:45:56.258 --> 01:45:57.467
<font color="#ffff54">Don’t worry.</font>

906
01:45:58.605 --> 01:46:03.938
<font color="#ffff54">I can make your bad dream...</font>

907
01:46:04.038 --> 01:46:06.376
<font color="#ffff54">go away.</font>

908
01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:17.876
<font color="#ffff54">Calm down.</font>

909
01:46:19.147 --> 01:46:20.272
<font color="#ffff54">Calm down.</font>

910
01:46:55.745 --> 01:46:57.203
<font color="#ffff54">Why are you afraid?</font>

911
01:47:01.328 --> 01:47:03.162
<font color="#ffff54">You know I won’t hurt you.</font>

912
01:47:13.048 --> 01:47:14.298
<font color="#ffff54">That’s it.</font>

913
01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.295
<font color="#ffff54">Close your eyes.</font>

914
01:48:30.983 --> 01:48:32.819
It's time to go home now.

915
01:48:33.124 --> 01:48:35.259
Tu casa. <font color="#ffff54">Your home.</font>

916
01:48:49.553 --> 01:48:51.221
Vamos. <font color="#ffff54">Let's go.</font>

917
01:49:05.786 --> 01:49:08.890
Boss, boss... <font color="#ffff54">Boss.</font>

918
01:49:08.891 --> 01:49:09.891
<font color="#ffff54">Boss.</font>

920
01:49:18.462 --> 01:49:19.804
<font color="#ffff54">Alacran!</font>

921
01:49:21.436 --> 01:49:23.204
Checho! <font color="#ffff54">Checho!</font>

<font color="#ffff54">Piranha!</font>

923
01:50:11.957 --> 01:50:13.210
<font color="#ffff54">Piranha, Piranha!</font>

924
01:50:13.362 --> 01:50:14.279
<font color="#ffff54">Yes, sir?</font>

925
01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:15.572
<font color="#ffff54">Check the river.</font>

926
01:50:16.566 --> 01:50:20.370
<font color="#ffff54">Yeah, yeah. They took the boat!</font>

927
01:50:26.552 --> 01:50:27.486
Hey!

928
01:50:29.461 --> 01:50:30.728

01:50:30.825 --> 01:50:32.593
Look.

930
01:50:50.031 --> 01:50:51.531
Let's go, let's go.

931
01:50:56.693 --> 01:50:58.458
Go, go, go, go, go.

932
01:51:24.430 --> 01:51:26.347
<font color="#ffff54">It’s okay, it’s okay.</font>

933
01:51:26.931 --> 01:51:28.281
You guys good?

934
01:51:28.282 --> 01:51:29.149
You alright?

935
01:51:29.197 --> 01:51:29.950
Yes

936
01:51:30.116 --> 01:51:32.384
Yeah, we're fine.
