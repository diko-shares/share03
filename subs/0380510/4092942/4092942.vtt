the edge of a table.

00:01:32.943 --> 00:01:34.808
There was a snow globe,

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:39.882

who lived inside the globe.

5
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:48.121
He was all alone in there,
and I worried for him.

I loved the way a photo could capture
a moment before it was gone.

18

I'd be tracking wild elephants

the earth could swallow things whole,

Ruth Connors.

said she was weird,

-Yeah, this is cool, huh?

346
00:27:38.166 --> 00:27:40.537
Yeah. I thought that you kids
would like a place of your own

-Yeah.
-Really?

354
00:28:03.563 --> 00:28:06.398
-She will be with Clarissa.
-She could have at least called.

355
00:28:06.398 --> 00:28:08.028

how to use a telephone.

I understand. I understand.
I will deal with her when she gets home.

Little, you know, fluffy animals
and some games,

360

like to play games.

362
00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.414

I hear something? Because...

Because surely

-No, no, thanks. I am fine.

-Uh-huh.

526
00:42:52.085 --> 00:42:55.087
and ran a few errands
or something like that, but, I mean...

527
00:42:56.958 --> 00:42:59.586

for the most part.

No, I wish. I wish. But no.

533
00:43:13.708 --> 00:43:15.972
-You mind if I take a look?
-No.

534
00:43:19.146 --> 00:43:21.774
-I make everything myself.
-Really?

535
00:43:21.774 --> 00:43:24.942
Oh, yeah. All this.
I turn all the banisters myself

536

and make
all the shingles and the furniture.

537
00:43:26.986 --> 00:43:28.612
And I used to do cabinet making,

538
00:43:28.612 --> 00:43:30.782
but there's not much call for that
these days.

539
00:43:30.782 --> 00:43:32.552

on these things,

540

I have been at the Public Records Office
all day.

Got a lot of stuff to go over here.

690
01:01:31.805 --> 01:01:33.898
I know you're looking
at the obvious suspects,

691
01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:36.805
convicted felons, child molesters.
And I understand why,

692
01:01:36.805 --> 01:01:39.743
but, Len, I think you're coming at it
from the wrong angle.

693
01:01:39.743 --> 01:01:42.576
-Honey...
-Herman Stolfuz just across the street.

694
01:01:42.576 --> 01:01:45.050
Now, he appears to be perfectly normal,
but, Len,

695
01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:48.988
-the man wears adult diapers.
-Herman is 80 years old.

696
01:01:48.988 --> 01:01:52.547
I followed him in the supermarket.
His shopping cart was filled with them.

697
01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:54.550
-He has a prostate problem.
-My point is,

698
01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:56.392
we need to start working backwards.

699
01:01:56.392 --> 01:02:00.159
Start looking at family histories,
criminal records, mental health issues.

700
01:02:00.159 --> 01:02:01.393
I have been doing a lot of reading
on this subject.

701
01:02:01.393 --> 01:02:04.766
-Jack, this doesn't change anything.
-Did I mention taxes? Len,

702
01:02:04.766 --> 01:02:06.261
you can tell a lot about a person
from taxes.

stop it now? Will you just stop?

to deal with this in your own way,

708
01:02:21.788 --> 01:02:25.280
but she's not coping very well.
She needs help, Jack.

709
01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:29.920

to help her get through this.

Len's worried. I am worried.
Your mother offered to help.

714
01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.705
You invited her here?

715

-Darling! Oh!
-Hello, Mother.

716
01:02:51.709 --> 01:02:53.275
-Watch the hair, sweetheart.
-Sorry.

717

-Look at you. Are you eating?
-JACK: Is this all of it?

Don't be ridiculous.
That's just my makeup.

Then he realizes that was his gun.

to the same door.

I wish you all a long and happy life.
