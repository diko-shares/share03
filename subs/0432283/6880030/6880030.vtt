What'd the doctor say?

13
00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.163
MRS. FOX: Nothing.
Supposedly, it's just a 24-hour bug.

14
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:03.456
He gave me some pills.

15
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.583
I told you, you probably
just ate some bad gristle.

16
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.252
Should we take the shortcut
or the scenic route?

17
00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:08.336
Let's take the shortcut.

18
00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.588
Hmm. But the scenic route
is so much prettier.

19
00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.674
-Okay, let's take the scenic route.
-Great.

20
00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.384
It's actually slightly quicker anyway.

Thank you.

24
00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.614
What is a squab?

25
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:39.701
You know what a squab is.
It's like a pigeon, I suppose.

26
00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:41.286
Should we go through the hole
under the horse fence,

27
00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:43.037
or climb the rail
over the bridle path?

28
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.248
Well, I guess the horse fence
would be a little safer.

29
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.710
But the bridle path puts us right out
next to the squab shack.

30
00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.503
(sighs) Well, okay.

31
00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:53.381
What's wrong?
You're acting all skittish.

32
00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:55.967
Don't worry.
I've been stealing birds for a living

33
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.218
since before I could trot.

34
00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.971
By the way, you look
unbelievably beautiful tonight.

35
00:03:00.054 --> 00:03:01.389
You're practically glowing.

36
00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.141
Maybe it's the lighting.

-MRS. FOX: What?

49
00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.100
-I think it's a fox trap.
-MRS. FOX: Where?

50
00:03:46.184 --> 00:03:47.518
-Look at this.
-MRS. FOX: No, get away from there.

51
00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:48.770
Is it spring-loaded?

52
00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:50.980
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
if you come from over there

53
00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.358
and you're standing at this door
to the squab shack,

-MRS. FOX: What...

55
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.153
Move out of the way, darling,
that's right where it's going to land.

56
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.613

60
00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.581

Do your friends ever talk about it?

78
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.386
Of course. In fact, Rabbit's
ex-girlfriend said to me last week,

Put him in Dad's study.

something about it.

Well, I'm off.
Have a good day, my darlings.

108
00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:14.248

for a reason.

00:06:15.124 --> 00:06:17.210
Mm. Yes and no.

Why a cape with the pants
tucked into your socks?

113
00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:31.182
Well, I guess he's just...

114
00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.267
different.

115
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:34.477

116
00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:37.855
WEASEL:
I'm not the listing agent on it,

117
00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.315
so it doesn't really matter
to me either way

118
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.858
But I know he's interested...

119
00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:44.779
Uh, actually, there he is.
Uh, hey, Mr. Fox! Yes. Here it is!

120
00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:48.699
This is the tree! Come on over.
I'm gonna call you back, Bob.

121
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:52.995
Obviously, it's first growth,
indigenous, original dirt floor.

122
00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.873
Good bark, skipping stone hearth,
as you can see.

-Oh, what time is it? I'm sorry.

He's the super. He's a little, uh...

127

128
00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.012
WEASEL: See? See what his eyes
look like? Hey, Kylie.

129
00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.347
-Kylie!
-Huh?

130
00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.891
Just minnows. Want to try one?

131
00:07:13.975 --> 00:07:15.184
Certainly. Thank you.

132
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.730
It's not exactly an evergreen, is it?

133
00:07:19.814 --> 00:07:22.358
Are there any pines on the market
on this side of the river?

134
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:25.153
Pines are pretty hard
to come by in your price range.

135
00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:26.779
What... What's that?

136
00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:29.031
(solemn instrumental music playing)

137
00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:39.292
May I ask what you do
for a living, Mr. Fox?

138
00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:42.837
I used to steal birds,
but now I'm a newspaperman.

139
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.298
Oh, sure. I've seen your byline.

140
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:46.466
-Hmm.
-(snickers)

141
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.552
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
-You're going? You're going?

142
00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:53.890
Oh, and Kylie, thank you
for the minnow. It was superb.

143
00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:04.150
Don't buy this tree, Foxy.

144
00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.486
You're borrowing at nine and a half
with no fixed rate,

145
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.030
plus moving into the most dangerous
neighborhood in the country

146
00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:10.490
for someone of your type of species.

147
00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:12.241
You're exaggerating, Badger.

148
00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:13.451
(scoffs)

149
00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:16.913
I'm sugar-coating it, man.
This is Boggis, Bunce and Bean,

150
00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:19.540
three of the meanest,
nastiest, ugliest farmers

152
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.752
Really? Tell me about them.

153
00:08:24.128 --> 00:08:25.171
All right.

154
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.507

162
00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:44.732
<i>and his chin would be underwater</i>

163

<i>in the shallow end of any</i>
<i>swimming pool on the planet.</i>

164
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.028
<i>His food is homemade donuts</i>

165

<i>injected into them.</i>

<i>He invented his own species of each.</i>

168
00:08:57.036 --> 00:09:00.248
<i>He lives on a liquid diet</i>
<i>of strong alcoholic cider,</i>

169
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:01.499

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:06.045
<i>He's as skinny as a pencil,</i>
<i>as smart as a whip,</i>

172
00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:08.631
<i>and possibly the scariest man</i>
<i>currently living.</i>

173
00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:13.427
The local human children
sing a kind of...

174
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.846
eerie little (chuckles)
rhyme about him.

175
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.056
Here, listen to this.

176
00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.559
<i>♪ Boggis, Bunce and Bean ♪</i>

177
00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.769
<i>♪ One fat, one short, one lean ♪</i>

178
00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:23.938
<i>♪ These horrible crooks</i>
<i>So different in looks ♪</i>

179
00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:25.773
<i>♪ Were nonetheless equally mean ♪</i>

180
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:30.403
In summation, I think you just
gotta not do it, man. That's all.

181
00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:32.697
MR. FOX: I understand
what you're saying,

182
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.031
and your comments are valuable,

183
00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.534
but I'm going to ignore your advice.

184
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.995
The cuss you are.

185
00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.916
The cuss am I?
Are you cussing with me?

186
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.085
-No, are you cussing with me?
-Don't cussing point at me.

187
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:47.670
Don't cuss with someone
you're not going to cuss with,

188
00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:48.838
you little cuss!

189
00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:51.549
(snarling)

190
00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:53.092
(hissing)

191
00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:55.469
(bell dings)

192
00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.141
-Just buy the tree.
-Okay.

193
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.893
Take a left, and then to the right.
Set them down. There's another batch.

194
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:03.978
Help that other guy over there.

195
00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:05.354
Lift with your legs,
not with your back.

196
00:10:05.438 --> 00:10:07.690
Flip it sideways.
Don't try to be a superman here.

197
00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:08.899
All right, we got two circuits here,

198
00:10:08.983 --> 00:10:10.484
We got the yellow circuit
and the green circuit.

199
00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:11.611
Let's just keep them separated.

200
00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:14.947
Hold it right there. We need to bring
about two percent more in.

201
00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.617
Good. Here we go. A little bit more,
a little bit more. Looks good.

202
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.785
Let's get that bottom structure
really settled in.

203
00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.037
Let's bring in the side unit.

204
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.205
Watch out. Try to be careful
of the branches here, guys.

205
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.540
Don't peel away the bark.

206
00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:30.171
ASH: Wow.

207
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:33.215
-Hi.
-Hi.

208
00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:53.569
(doorbell rings)

209
00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:56.906
He's slightly younger,
but a cuss of a lot bigger.

210
00:10:56.989 --> 00:11:00.117
That's just genetics, I guess.
Ash has a littler body type.

211
00:11:00.951 --> 00:11:02.828
(music playing on gramophone)

212
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.498
(clears throat)

213
00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.292
(sighs) Go.

214
00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.170
Watch this, Dad!

215
00:11:12.963 --> 00:11:14.215
Well, well.

216
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.551
Good jump, Ash.
Remember to keep your tail tucked.

217
00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.890
Still painting thunderstorms, I see.

218
00:11:23.224 --> 00:11:24.850
Do you still feel poor?

219
00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:27.603
Less so.

220
00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:30.523
(inhales)

221
00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:40.491
(whooping in admiration)

222
00:11:40.574 --> 00:11:42.368
Look at that! This kid's a natural.

223
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.869
I'm speechless, Kristofferson.

224
00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:48.666
(grumbling)

225
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.546
Plus, he knows karate.

226
00:11:59.969 --> 00:12:02.596
-Do you think I'm an athlete?
-What are you talking about?

227
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.765
Well, you know,
I think I'm an athlete.

228
00:12:04.849 --> 00:12:07.601
And, sometimes, I feel like you guys
don't see me that way.

229
00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:10.938
What's the subtext here?
Is he praying?

230
00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:13.023
I think that's yoga.

231
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.068
(chanting softly)

232
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.320
How long is Kristofferson
supposed to stay with us?

233
00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:20.281
Until your uncle gets better.

234
00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:22.825
Right, but, roughly, how long
do we plan to give him on that?

235
00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.118
Double pneumonia?

236
00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:25.953
It isn't really that
big a deal, is it?

237
00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:28.164
(whispering)
Lower your voice, Ash.

238
00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.878
(enchanting music playing)

239
00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:36.422
(sighs)

240
00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:38.507
Who am I, Kylie?

241
00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.010
Who how? What now?

242
00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:45.097
Why a fox? Why not a horse
or a beetle or a bald eagle?

243
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.142
I'm saying this more as,
like, existentialism, you know?

244
00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:50.895
Who am I, and how can a fox
ever be happy

245
00:12:50.978 --> 00:12:54.273
without, forgive the expression,
a chicken in its teeth?

246
00:12:55.232 --> 00:12:57.443
I don't know what you're
talking about, but it sounds illegal.

247
00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.028
Here, put this bandit hat on.

248
00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:02.406
Maybe you're a medium.
Take it off

249
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:03.657
and don't wear it around the house.

250
00:13:05.659 --> 00:13:06.994
And so it begins.

251
00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:08.704
(music playing on radio)

252
00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:11.123
Uh, do you mind if I slide my bedroll

253
00:13:11.207 --> 00:13:12.750
slightly out from under the train set?

254
00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:14.835
It's hard to sleep
in that corkscrew position.

255
00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:18.631
There's a lot of attitudes
going on around here.

256
00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:20.800
Don't let me get one.

257
00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:22.468
No, it's just that
my spinal cord is...

258
00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:23.677
Sleep wherever you want, man.

259
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.222
Here, take my bed. I'll just, uh...

260
00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:27.723
I'll crawl under the bookcase.

261
00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:29.475
Who cares if I get
splinters in my ears?

262
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.894
-Never mind.
-What? Are you going to pout about it?

263
00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.562
'Cause I've had it up to here

264
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.397
with the sad house guest routine.

265
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.031
Good night.

266
00:13:53.666 --> 00:13:55.918
(Kristofferson crying softly)

267
00:14:13.227 --> 00:14:15.062
(lively music playing)

268
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.675
I used to do this professionally
and I was very successful at it.

269
00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:46.510
I had to get out of it
for personal reasons,

270
00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:50.431
but I've decided to secretly do
one last big job on the sly.

271
00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:53.350
I'm bringing you in as my secretary
and personal assistant.

272
00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:54.560
Okay.

273
00:14:55.185 --> 00:14:58.063
This is actually kind of a big deal,
so don't just say, "Okay."

274
00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.231
Okay. Well, thank you.

275
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.691
I'm going to tape this
for my records,

276
00:15:00.774 --> 00:15:02.151
so don't make a lot of sounds.

277
00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:03.986
Meaning, stop rocking.

278
00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:07.990
Master Plan. Phase one. Side A.

279
00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:10.534
MR. FOX: <i>We'll start with</i>
<i>Boggis's Chicken House Number One.</i>

280
00:15:10.618 --> 00:15:12.703
<i>His only security</i>
<i>is a few old hunting beagles</i>

281
00:15:12.786 --> 00:15:13.913
<i>and a low stone wall.</i>

282
00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:15.497
<i>Now, a word about beagles.</i>

283
00:15:15.581 --> 00:15:17.750
<i>Never look a beagle</i>
<i>directly in the eye.</i>

284
00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.419
Why not?
Beagles aren't so tough.

285
00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.881
Yeah? Well, first of all, one of these
beagles has chronic rabies,

286
00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:25.215
which he's on medication for.

287
00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.800
And if you get bit by him,
you have to get shots

288
00:15:26.884 --> 00:15:27.968
in your stomach for six months.

289
00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:30.304
And, second... Listen,
I'm not going to justify this.

290
00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:33.098
You just pay attention and stop
interrupting me. I'm taping this.

291
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.225
<i>I picked some blueberries</i>
<i>and laced each one</i>

292
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.353
<i>with 10 mg of high potency</i>
<i>sleeping powder.</i>

293
00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.812
<i>Enough to tranquilize a gorilla.</i>

294
00:15:38.896 --> 00:15:41.523
-How do we make them eat it?
-Beagles love blueberries.

295
00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:43.859
MR. FOX:
<i>Remember, they aren't very smart,</i>

296
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:45.235
<i>but they're incredibly paranoid,</i>

297
00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:47.613
<i>so always kill a chicken in one bite.</i>

298
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:49.573
One bite, get it?

299
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.369
Are you listening to me?
I look in your eyes

300
00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.245
and can't tell whether you're getting
anything I'm saying.

301
00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.668
Magnesium.

302
00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:03.754
-Magnesium!
-Sorry.

303
00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:06.465
Uh, pipette.

304
00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:08.217
-Pipette!
-Oh, sorry.

305
00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:11.762
Potassium tri...
What are you looking at?

306
00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:12.972
Oh, no.

307
00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.518
Why's your cousin
such a wet sandwich?

308
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.103
-I beg your pardon?
-What's that mean?

309
00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:21.480
That means I didn't understand
what you just said. A wet sandwich?

310
00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:22.773
Yeah. A wet sandwich.

311
00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:24.817
He's too short, he dresses
like a girl, he's...

312
00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:26.318
different.

313
00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:28.779
Are you a bully?
You're starting to sound like a bully.

314
00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.656
(chuckles) Watch this.

315
00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:32.324
(laughing)

316
00:16:32.408 --> 00:16:34.576
You just destroyed
the whole experiment.

317
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.246
We better extinguish this magnesium.
Stand back.

318
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:40.332
(exclaims in admiration)

319
00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:41.625
(whistles, sighs)

320
00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.462
Hmm. I like your ears.

321
00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.089
(stammering) M-Mine?

322
00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:50.676
-AGNES: Mm-hmm.
-Thank you. I like your spots.

323
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.220
Really? I used to cover them up,
but, uh, you know...

324
00:16:53.303 --> 00:16:54.346
(scoffs)

325
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.849
-Hmm?
-You're supposed to be my lab partner.

326
00:16:56.932 --> 00:16:58.308
I am.

327
00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.352
No, you're not.
You're disloyal.

328
00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.689
(exhilarating music playing)

329
00:17:17.911 --> 00:17:19.246
(both panting)

330
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:21.874
(sniffs)

331
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:24.334
A few beagles, as we discussed,
but we're ready for that.

332
00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:27.921
Yeah, back in the old days,

333
00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.007
didn't we used to do a thing
where if somebody saw a wolf--

334
00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.467
Wolf?
What wolf?

335
00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.763
Uh. Nothing?
Never mind.

336
00:17:37.056 --> 00:17:39.016
Here comes the little stone wall.
Not a problem.

337
00:17:39.099 --> 00:17:40.142
(both grunt)

338
00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.564
What the cuss? Where did this
giant fence come from?

339
00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:47.900
-We had a master plan.
-What's this lightning bolt?

340
00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:52.404
That could mean, maybe,
this fence might be electric.

341
00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:54.239
Well, I just hope
it doesn't mean thunder,

342
00:17:54.323 --> 00:17:55.407
because I have a phobia of that.

343
00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:56.784
Ah!

344
00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:07.002
Watch this.

345
00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:19.848
(sniffs)

346
00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:26.188
(exclaims in joy)

347
00:18:26.563 --> 00:18:27.564
(whistles, clicks tongue)

348
00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.278
Beagles love blueberries.
Didn't I tell you?

349
00:18:33.362 --> 00:18:34.863
The master plan is working again.

350
00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.366
Now, this is the tricky part.

351
00:18:37.449 --> 00:18:39.243
One of us has got to
jump the barbed wire,

352
00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.870
slide under the tire spikes
and slip open the fence latch.

353
00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.205
-Who's it gonna be?
-Not me.

354
00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:45.165
Hmm. You know who could
do this part easily?

355
00:18:45.249 --> 00:18:47.459
It's Kristofferson. That kid's like a
professional, Olympic level...

356
00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.461
Why don't we run that way?
There's no obstacles.

357
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.339
Yeah, that's better.

358
00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:01.181
-(Mr. Fox snarling)
-(hens clucking in panic)

359
00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:03.225
(Kylie gasping nervously)

360
00:19:03.308 --> 00:19:04.768
-I said one bite.
-I'm trying!

361
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.104
I have a different kind of teeth
from you. I'm an opossum.

362
00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:08.730
Give me that.

363
00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:10.399
(Mr. Fox snarling)

364
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.152
That's so grisly.
There's blood and everything.

365
00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:14.278
Follow me.

366
00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:16.864
(exhilarating music playing)

367
00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.087
All right,
what's the master escape plan?

368
00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.257
(alarms blaring)

369
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:37.009
Follow me again.

370
00:19:37.593 --> 00:19:40.637
(both screaming in pain)

371
00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:47.603
Give me that!

372
00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:00.824
All right. Let's hit the five-and-dime
on the way home.

373
00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.284
We need to make
some fake price tags

374
00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.577
and wrap these chickens
in wax paper

375
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.204
so it looks like we got it
from the butcher's shop!

376
00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.080
(whooping excitedly)

377
00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.373
(Both howling)

378
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.210
(Mrs. Fox gasps)

379
00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:12.920
MRS. FOX: Huh.

380
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.047
(whistling nonchalantly)

381
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.590
Where'd you get this chicken?

382
00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:19.343
I picked it up at the five-and-dime
last night on my way back.

383
00:20:19.426 --> 00:20:22.054
It's got a Boggis Farms tag
around its ankle.

384
00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:25.182
Huh. Must have escaped from there
before I bought it.

385
00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:27.309
-(whistling casually)
-Yeah.

386
00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:32.898
Psst!

387
00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:34.650
It's Bunce tonight.

388
00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.235
He's got a refrigerated smokehouse

389
00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:37.444
-with 100 geese--
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

390
00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:40.280
I thought you said we were
only doing one last big job.

391
00:20:40.364 --> 00:20:43.992
We are. But it's not done yet.
It's a triple-header.

392
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.286
(Mr. Fox whispering)

393
00:20:47.704 --> 00:20:48.830
(Mr. Fox shushing)

394
00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:53.543
(instrumental music playing
over headphones)

395
00:21:04.012 --> 00:21:05.097
(Kylie sneezes)

396
00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:11.144
(thuds)

397
00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:13.355
(rooster crowing)

398
00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.732
(both laughing quietly)

399
00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:17.317
(Mr. Fox shushing)

400
00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:20.445
(Mrs. Fox gasps)

401
00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:22.614
MRS. FOX: Huh.

402
00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:23.782
Let's see some hustle.

403
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:25.617
Coach, we don't have whack-bat
where I'm from.

404
00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:26.702
What are the rules?

405
00:21:26.785 --> 00:21:28.912
There's no whack-bat
on the other side of the river?

406
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:32.124
No, we mostly just run grass sprints
or play acorns.

407
00:21:32.207 --> 00:21:34.376
Hmm. Well, it's real simple.
Basically,

408
00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.169
<i>there's three grabbers,</i>
<i>three taggers,</i>

409
00:21:36.253 --> 00:21:38.297
<i>five twig-runners</i>
<i>and the player at whack-bat.</i>

410
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.632
<i>The center-tagger lights a pinecone,</i>
<i>chucks it over the basket.</i>

411
00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:43.218
<i>The whack-batter tries to hit</i>
<i>the cedar-stick off the cross-rock.</i>

412
00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.970
<i>The twig-runners</i>
<i>dash back and forth</i>

413
00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:47.472
<i>until the pinecone burns out</i>
<i>and the umpire calls "hot box."</i>

414
00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:48.724
Finally, at the end, you count up

415
00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:51.184
however many score-downs
it adds up to and divide that by nine.

416
00:21:51.268 --> 00:21:52.811
-Got it.
-Go in for Ash.

417
00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:56.231
Substitution! Ash, come out!
You need a breather.

418
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.691
ASH: What? Come out?

419
00:21:57.774 --> 00:22:00.944
What? I still feel good, Coach.
Let me finish this eighth.

420
00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.905
No, come on.
Step out, let's go.

421
00:22:05.949 --> 00:22:07.492
Am I getting better, Coach?

422
00:22:07.868 --> 00:22:10.120
Well, you're sure as cuss
not getting any worse.

423
00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:12.205
Really? You mean,
you think I could end up

424
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:14.207
being as good as my dad
if I keep practicing?

425
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:15.459
Your dad?

426
00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:18.086
Your dad was probably
the best whack-bat player

427
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.504
we ever had in this school.

428
00:22:24.926 --> 00:22:27.179
No, you don't wanna have to
compare yourself to that.

429
00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:31.350
No, but I think I have some of the
same raw, natural talent, don't you?

430
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.227
You're improving,
let's put it like that.

431
00:22:43.278 --> 00:22:45.280
(whistle blowing)

432
00:22:45.364 --> 00:22:47.324
(valiant instrumental
music playing)

433
00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:01.213
UMPIRE: Hot box!

434
00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:03.090
KRISTOFFERSON:
Divide that by nine, please!

435
00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:04.341
Yeah! Whoo!

436
00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:07.135
That's the first time this kid's
ever swung a whack-bat?

437
00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.513
He really is your father's nephew,
isn't he?

438
00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:11.348
-Not by blood.
-No?

439
00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:13.600
-He's from my mother's side.
-Oh, yeah.

440
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:16.269
What's that stand for?

441
00:23:17.479 --> 00:23:19.773
Huh? It's, uh... It's for pep.

442
00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:21.274
Pep? It's a K.

443
00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:23.735
Come on now, look alive! Attaboy!

444
00:23:24.945 --> 00:23:26.071
We're going steady.

445
00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:27.239
(groans)

446
00:23:27.322 --> 00:23:29.241
(music playing on radio)

447
00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:32.035
What's that?

448
00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.870
What's what?
What, this?

449
00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:36.873
Oh, it's nothing. Just some old trophy
I won for being an athlete.

450
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:41.795
I'm supposed to cover
this book party at some animal's nest

451
00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:43.505
in a tobacco field down the hill.

452
00:23:43.588 --> 00:23:45.799
So me and Kylie are going to
hop over there and give it a whirl.

453
00:23:45.882 --> 00:23:47.092
Don't wait up.

454
00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:48.343
What's the book?

455
00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:51.638
Some memoir. I'll get him
to sign you a copy.

456
00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.266
Dinner was (kisses) pitch perfect.

457
00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:03.608
I spotted a couple of broken
burglar bars

458
00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:05.694
underneath the back door
to Bean's secret cider cellar.

459
00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:07.696
-We're breaking into Bean's house?
-Cellar.

460
00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:09.739
-Where he lives?
-Where he keeps the cider.

461
00:24:09.823 --> 00:24:11.741
-Below where he lives.
-Where'd you come from?

462
00:24:11.825 --> 00:24:13.326
Why don't you go back to the tree
and do your homework.

463
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.786
I want to help you
steal some cider.

464
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:15.996
We're going to a book party,

465
00:24:16.079 --> 00:24:17.581
and keep your mouth shut
about any cider,

466
00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:19.207
because nobody said that.
Now, get outta here!

467
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:20.834
-But... Uh...
-But nothing.

468
00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:22.210
You're going to get me
in a lot of trouble.

469
00:24:22.294 --> 00:24:24.129
Besides, you're too little
and uncoordinated.

470
00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:28.008
One, two, three!

471
00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:29.926
(grumbling)

472
00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:32.179
Where the cuss
does that kid get off?

473
00:24:32.262 --> 00:24:34.264
Can you believe that?
How'd he get tipped off?

474
00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:38.935
You think he's gonna
tell on us?

475
00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.063
Before we go any further,
from now on,

476
00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:43.899
can you give me some kind of a signal
once in a while

477
00:24:43.982 --> 00:24:45.567
just so I know any of this
is getting through to you?

478
00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:49.529
Is that it? Okay. All right.

479
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:50.780
Uh, there's another one.

480
00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:54.367
-Good, you made it. Anybody see you?
-I don't think so.

481
00:24:54.451 --> 00:24:55.911
Here, put this bandit hat on.

482
00:24:58.163 --> 00:24:59.664
I must say,
I'm pleased to be invited,

483
00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:01.541
but I'm not sure
I should be doing this, Uncle Foxy.

484
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:02.751
-Why not?
--I don't like to be

485
00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:04.002
dishonest with people.

486
00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:06.046
Well, just keep your mouth shut,
it won't be a problem.

487
00:25:06.129 --> 00:25:07.589
Yeah, but I don't think
he should come with us either.

488
00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:08.673
We're not taking a vote!

489
00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:13.011
You know, one time,
this wolf I saw...

490
00:25:13.094 --> 00:25:14.387
Wolf? What's with
all the wolf talk?

491
00:25:14.471 --> 00:25:15.555
Can we give it a rest for once?

492
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:17.766
(grunting)

493
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.935
(clanging)

494
00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:25.815
(bubbling)

495
00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:30.570
Look at all this apple juice.

496
00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:34.157
Apple juice? Apple juice?
We didn't come here for apple juice.

497
00:25:34.241 --> 00:25:37.911
This is some of the strongest,
finest alcoholic cider money can buy,

498
00:25:37.994 --> 00:25:39.454
or that can even be stolen.

499
00:25:40.247 --> 00:25:42.707
It burns in your throat,
boils in your stomach,

500
00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:45.669
and tastes almost exactly
like pure, melted gold.

501
00:25:45.752 --> 00:25:46.795
(fingers snap)

502
00:25:47.671 --> 00:25:48.838
(match striking)

503
00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:52.133
(sinister music playing)

504
00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:59.099
Y'all are trespassing now,
illegally.

505
00:26:04.938 --> 00:26:09.442
'Round these parts, we don't
take kindly to cider poachers.

506
00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:11.361
You've aged badly, Rat.

507
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.323
You're getting a little long
in the tooth yourself, partner.

508
00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:16.491
(snaps fingers)

509
00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:21.246
Bean security? What? Why are you
wearing that badge? What is that?

510
00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:24.499
It's my job.

511
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:26.626
(exclaiming)

512
00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:32.674
(hissing)

513
00:26:39.931 --> 00:26:41.725
How's your old lady doing?

514
00:26:41.808 --> 00:26:43.727
Do you refer to my wife?

515
00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.896
She was the town tart
in her day.

516
00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:49.107
Wild and footloose and...

517
00:26:49.566 --> 00:26:51.860
(snaps fingers)
pretty as a mink stole.

518
00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:53.236
Is that true?

519
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:57.324
Of course not. I mean,
certainly, she lived. We all did.

520
00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:58.408
It was a different time.

521
00:26:58.491 --> 00:27:00.410
Let's not use a double standard.
She marched against the--

522
00:27:00.493 --> 00:27:02.287
-But town tart?
-Shut up.

523
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.289
-(Rat exclaims angrily)
-(bottles shattering)

524
00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:06.458
That was close, Rat.
Be careful.

525
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.127
Oh, I'm careful as a...

526
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.378
(door latch unlocking)

527
00:27:11.254 --> 00:27:13.173
-(exclaims)
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.(screams)

528
00:27:16.217 --> 00:27:18.011
(grunting)

529
00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:32.108
(sinister music playing)

530
00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:37.322
How many jars
should I bring up, Franklin?

531
00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:38.740
BEAN: I don't know.
Two, I guess.

532
00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.493
MRS. BEAN: Well, you drank
three yesterday though.

533
00:27:41.576 --> 00:27:43.620
BEAN: All right. Take three.

534
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:51.086
(Rat grunting)

535
00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:56.299
Nope. Two is plenty.

536
00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:00.887
(door closes)

537
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.848
Oh, my cuss.
Is she blind?

538
00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:07.310
She might have astigmatism
or possibly a cataract of some form.

539
00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:08.728
Anyway, her eyes don't see well.

540
00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.772
-(door squeaking open)
-(Kylie gasps)

541
00:28:11.523 --> 00:28:13.566
(sinister music playing)

542
00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:24.160
Wooh! Ah!
What'd I tell you?

543
00:28:24.244 --> 00:28:25.829
This kid's a natural. Am I right?

544
00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:30.917
(ominous music playing)

545
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.377
BEAN: Ah, it's so good of you to come.

546
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.421
Lovely to see you.
You're both looking splendid.

547
00:28:34.504 --> 00:28:36.715
How have you been, Walter?
In good health, I trust?

548
00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:38.967
-Uh, we--
-BEAN: Nathan? All's well?

549
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.301
-Uh--
-BEAN: Wonderful.

550
00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:43.430
Any fox problems?

551
00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.348
-Are you joking?
-It's horrible.

552
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:46.599
-We're miserable.
-He's laughing at us.

553
00:28:46.683 --> 00:28:47.851
-It's humiliating.
-We're furious.

554
00:28:47.934 --> 00:28:49.060
I don't even want to talk about it.

555
00:28:52.355 --> 00:28:53.565
(slurping slowly)

556
00:28:56.818 --> 00:28:58.445
Perhaps we ought to kill him.

557
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:01.906
-Well, that seems rather obvious.
-He's too sneaky.

558
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:05.660
Ah, right, of course.
He's very clever, isn't he?

559
00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:07.704
Might be a bit difficult,
I suppose.

560
00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:14.294
(glass shattering)

561
00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:15.378
(dogs barking)

562
00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.424
But I've already figured out
where this fox lives.

563
00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:21.134
And tomorrow night,
we'll camp in the bushes,

564
00:29:21.217 --> 00:29:22.886
wait for him to come out
the hole in his tree

565
00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:24.763
and shoot the cuss to smithereens.

566
00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:25.972
How does that grab you, fellas?

567
00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:29.225
-BUNCE: Hmm. Yeah.
-BOGGIS: Yeah. I don't see why not.

568
00:29:30.435 --> 00:29:32.353
(door creaking open)

569
00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:41.696
MRS. FOX:
Another book party?

570
00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:47.076
Whoa. I didn't see you
sitting in the dark over there.

571
00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:50.079
Yeah. No, actually,
there was a fire.

572
00:29:50.163 --> 00:29:52.457
I just got the call.
They said maybe it's arson.

573
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.584
I gotta interview the marshal
and see what's...

574
00:29:54.667 --> 00:29:56.920
Kylie, is he telling the truth?

575
00:29:57.003 --> 00:29:58.338
(stammering)

576
00:29:58.421 --> 00:29:59.714
I don't want to be put
in the middle of this.

577
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:00.840
Thanks, Kylie.

578
00:30:00.924 --> 00:30:03.468
Why is he wearing that bandit hat?

579
00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:09.015
His ears were cold.
He's not with us. Go back to bed.

580
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.561
If what I think is happening
is happening,

581
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:15.772
it better not be.

582
00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:18.525
(ominous music playing)

583
00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:28.952
(sniffing)

584
00:30:33.581 --> 00:30:35.166
Nice job covering for me.

585
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:36.459
-Next time...
-(rustling)

586
00:30:37.043 --> 00:30:38.294
(growling softly)

587
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.797
(beeping)

588
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:47.679
(wind blowing)

589
00:30:48.555 --> 00:30:50.390
(sniffing)

590
00:30:50.473 --> 00:30:51.599
All three!

591
00:30:51.683 --> 00:30:54.519
-BEAN: Kill him!
-(Mr. Fox and Kylie screaming)

592
00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.156
(somber music playing)

593
00:31:16.291 --> 00:31:18.668
We got the tail,
but we missed the fox.

594
00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.589
Petey, sorry to wake you.

595
00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:24.632
Can I trouble you
to dash out here right away

596
00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.593
with, shall we say, three shovels,
two pickaxes,

597
00:31:26.676 --> 00:31:28.219
500 rounds of ammunition,

598
00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:30.638
and, um...
a bottle of apple cider?

599
00:31:32.515 --> 00:31:35.268
-ASH: It'll grow back, won't it?
-Tails don't grow back.

600
00:31:35.351 --> 00:31:37.645
-Tails don't grow back?
-Mm-mm. Except for lizards.

601
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:39.022
Tails don't grow back.

602
00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.190
I'm gonna be tail-less
for the rest of my life.

603
00:31:41.649 --> 00:31:44.360
Well, anyway, it's not half as bad as
double pneumonia, right?

604
00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:46.112
I mean, his dad's got
one foot in the grave

605
00:31:46.195 --> 00:31:47.697
and three feet on a banana peel.

606
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:48.907
That's a lot worse than...

607
00:31:52.285 --> 00:31:54.787
Excuse me, everyone. I'm going to go
meditate for half an hour.

608
00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:59.542
You have got 29 minutes
to come up with a proper apology.

609
00:31:59.626 --> 00:32:01.836
Me? Me have an apology?

610
00:32:02.295 --> 00:32:04.339
He gets a bandit hat?
He just got here, he got a bandit hat?

611
00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.715
Where's my bandit hat?

612
00:32:05.798 --> 00:32:07.008
Why didn't I get shot at?

613
00:32:07.091 --> 00:32:10.094
It's because you think (yells angrily)
I'm no good at anything!

614
00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:11.638
Well, maybe, you're right, thanks.

615
00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:14.599
(Mr. Fox sighs)

616
00:32:14.682 --> 00:32:15.850
I told you not to bring him.

617
00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:19.103
Why the cuss didn't I
listen to my lawyer?

618
00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:21.147
At this point, we'll be lucky
if we can flip this tree

619
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.316
for half of what
we've already sunk into it.

620
00:32:23.399 --> 00:32:25.902
I won't be able to sleep
on my back for six weeks,

621
00:32:25.985 --> 00:32:27.862
and on my stomach,
I feel congested.

622
00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:30.323
Why the cuss didn't I
listen to my lawyer?

623
00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:32.492
-Because you don't listen to anybody.
-(thudding)

624
00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:34.619
What was that?

625
00:32:34.702 --> 00:32:35.912
-MRS. FOX: What? I said...
-(rattling)

626
00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:37.789
Wake up, everybody!
They're digging us out!

627
00:32:37.872 --> 00:32:40.416
-They'll kill the children.
-Over my dead body, they will.

628
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.543
That's what I'm saying.
You'd be dead too, in that scenario.

629
00:32:42.627 --> 00:32:43.753
Well, I'm arguing against that.

630
00:32:43.836 --> 00:32:45.171
-What are you talking about?
-Why are you yelling?

631
00:32:45.254 --> 00:32:46.297
Stop, stop, stop!

632
00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:49.133
You say one thing, she says another,
and it all changes back again!

633
00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:50.468
(cracking)

634
00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:54.222
(thudding)

635
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:01.854
I've got it. There's not
a moment to lose.

636
00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:03.773
-Why didn't I think of this sooner?
-Think of what?

637
00:33:04.565 --> 00:33:05.650
We've been trapped before.

638
00:33:06.526 --> 00:33:09.112
(shouting) Dig!

639
00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:10.822
(upbeat music playing)

640
00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:12.532
(all grunting)

641
00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:26.963
(all panting)

642
00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:32.135
I think it's time for me to give us
a pep talk and explain some things.

643
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:34.262
A very long time ago...

644
00:33:34.345 --> 00:33:36.014
May I have a word
with you privately?

645
00:33:36.431 --> 00:33:38.224
Well, we're in a hole here.

646
00:33:38.307 --> 00:33:41.310
Just on the other side of this
mineral deposit. Follow me.

647
00:33:44.147 --> 00:33:46.482
(breathing shallowly)
I'm going to lose my temper now.

648
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.152
-When?
-Right now.

649
00:33:49.235 --> 00:33:52.113
Well, when?
(groaning)

650
00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:57.827
Twelve fox-years ago,
you made a promise to me

651
00:33:58.286 --> 00:34:01.289
while we were caged
in that fox trap that, if we survived,

652
00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:04.292
you would never steal
another chicken, turkey, goose, duck

653
00:34:04.375 --> 00:34:05.877
or squab, whatever they are.

654
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.547
And I believed you.
Why? (sobbing) Why did you lie to me?

655
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:13.009
Because I'm a wild animal.

656
00:34:13.593 --> 00:34:16.512
You are also a husband and a father!

657
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.599
I'm trying to tell you
the truth about myself.

658
00:34:20.183 --> 00:34:22.310
I don't care about
the truth about yourself.

659
00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:26.522
This story is too predictable.

660
00:34:27.106 --> 00:34:29.984
Predictable, really?
What happens in the end?

661
00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:33.404
In the end, (sniffles) we all die.

662
00:34:34.572 --> 00:34:36.199
Unless you change.

663
00:34:51.798 --> 00:34:53.966
Petey, listen, run down
to the rental department

664
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.885
at Malloy Consolidated
and place an order

665
00:34:55.968 --> 00:34:59.931
for, shall we say, one Mighty Max,
one Junior Spitfire,

666
00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:03.684
and a long-range Tornado 375 Turbo.
For immediate delivery.

667
00:35:04.227 --> 00:35:06.229
(all laughing maniacally)

668
00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:10.149
(tractors approaching)

669
00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:13.486
Huh?

670
00:35:13.569 --> 00:35:15.029
-Huh?
-Huh?

671
00:35:15.113 --> 00:35:16.114
(rumbling)

672
00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:17.740

I understand if you are,
and I'm sorry.

679
00:35:46.435 --> 00:35:47.770
I wouldn't have ever
involved your cousin

680
00:35:47.854 --> 00:35:49.605
if I'd realized you'd feel this way.

681
00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:51.607
It was only ever just because
he's kind of a natural,

682
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.901
I mean... I...
Look at him dig!

683
00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.444
(all grunting)

684
00:35:56.863 --> 00:35:58.322
Anyway, I'm sorry if you feel...

685
00:35:58.406 --> 00:36:00.449
You know what? I'm gonna
just put dirt in my ears.

686
00:36:00.533 --> 00:36:02.577
Yeah, that's better. I can't
hear you now, but keep talking.

(Kristofferson chanting softly)

690
00:36:25.057 --> 00:36:27.018
I don't have beagle ticks, by the way.

691
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:28.603
(stammering)
Well, me, neither.

692
00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:31.689
Whoever said we had beagle ticks,
by the way?

693
00:36:31.772 --> 00:36:33.691
Apparently, that's what
you've been telling everyone.

694
00:36:33.774 --> 00:36:35.276
Beagle ticks and pelt lice.

695
00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:38.529
I never said that. And you're
misquoting me. Or somebody is.

696
00:36:38.613 --> 00:36:39.864
But I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

697
00:36:40.948 --> 00:36:43.284
Look, Ash, we may or may not
ever see the light of day again,

698
00:36:43.367 --> 00:36:45.536
but I really like Agnes
and I think she likes me.

699
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.704
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Great.

700
00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:48.331
Well, she's a free agent.
What do I care?

701
00:36:48.414 --> 00:36:49.624
Well, then why are you
dead set on...

702
00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.376
-Can I ask you a question?
-You may.

703
00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.711
What's the point of
sitting on the floor

704
00:36:53.794 --> 00:36:55.129
with your legs
twisted into a pretzel

705
00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:56.881
talking to yourself
for an hour and 45 minutes?

706
00:36:56.964 --> 00:36:57.965
It's weird.

707
00:36:58.049 --> 00:36:59.592
My father and I first started

708
00:36:59.675 --> 00:37:01.052
practicing meditation
together when I was--

709
00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:02.970
Yeah, well, that's great,
but I'd worry more

710
00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:04.555
about what that does
for your reputation

711
00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.432
than whether or not
you have beagle ticks or not.

712
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:10.353
I don't. Nor pelt lice.

713
00:37:12.855 --> 00:37:14.023
(sighs)

714
00:37:14.106 --> 00:37:15.942
One of those slovenly farmers

715
00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:18.486
is probably wearing my tail
as a necktie by now.

716
00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.238
You're paranoid, Foxy.

717
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:21.572
REPORTER ON TV:

Stand clear, please.
Stand clear, everyone.

727
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:51.435
Contact!

728
00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:07.618
Boggis, how many men have you got
working on your farm?

729
00:38:07.702 --> 00:38:08.744
-35.
-Bunce?

730
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:09.912
-36.
-I've got 37.

731
00:38:09.996 --> 00:38:12.707
That... Carry the zero,
divide by two...

732
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.125
That's 108 all together.

733
00:38:16.168 --> 00:38:19.213
Petey, drop everything
and assemble all 108 members

734
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:21.215
of our entire three
combined work forces.

735
00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:23.134
We're gonna starve them out
and then kill them.

736
00:38:23.217 --> 00:38:24.343
Starting in, uh...

737
00:38:25.219 --> 00:38:27.013
shall we say, 15 minutes?

738
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:31.934
REPORTER: An estimated 108 snipers
are currently in position,

739
00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:34.562
surrounding the demolished
fox residence.

740
00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:37.648
Any local animals would appear
to be trapped underground

741
00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:39.900
without provisions of any kind
at this point.

742
00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:41.652
If I had a crystal ball,

743
00:38:41.736 --> 00:38:44.613
I'd predict a fairly grisly outcome
to this situation.

744
00:38:44.697 --> 00:38:46.824
But we'll stay on the scene,
watching closely,

745
00:38:46.907 --> 00:38:48.951
as events continue to unfold.

746
00:38:50.119 --> 00:38:54.040
This is going to be a total
cluster-cuss for everybody.

747
00:39:01.255 --> 00:39:03.632
How long can a fox go
without food or water?

748
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:05.760
Well, I can only answer
as an opossum,

749
00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:07.928
but I don't think I can last
more than another couple hours

750
00:39:08.012 --> 00:39:10.348
before I get completely
dehydrated and starve to death.

751
00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:11.432
What's that?

752
00:39:11.932 --> 00:39:14.435
(ominous music playing)

753
00:39:15.478 --> 00:39:17.813
(wind blowing)

754
00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:20.900
-ASH: Dad?
-MR. FOX: Not a sound.

755
00:39:20.983 --> 00:39:22.401
(clattering)

756
00:39:30.576 --> 00:39:32.119
You scared the cuss out of us!

757
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.872
(growling angrily)

758
00:39:34.955 --> 00:39:37.708
A lot of good animals
are probably gonna die

759
00:39:37.792 --> 00:39:39.335
because of you!

760
00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:43.756
We've been digging
in circles for three days.

761
00:39:43.839 --> 00:39:46.258
Half the woods have been obliterated.
Nobody can get out.

762
00:39:46.342 --> 00:39:48.761
Right now, my wife's huddled
at the bottom of a flint-mine

763
00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:52.640
with no food, no water,
and 27 starving animal brats!

764
00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:57.144
I just want to see a little sunshine.

765
00:39:57.228 --> 00:39:58.437
But you're nocturnal, Phil.

766
00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:00.398
Your eyes barely even open
on a good day.

767
00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:03.150
I'm sick of your double-talk!
We have rights!

768
00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.236
We don't like you
and we hate your dad.

769
00:40:05.319 --> 00:40:07.988
Now grab some of that mud,
chew it in your mouth and swallow it.

770
00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.074
-I'm not going to eat mud.
-Cuss, yeah, you are.

771
00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:19.333
Don't do that.

772
00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:21.585
Why'd you take your shoes off?

773
00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:23.629
So I don't break your nose
when I kick it.

774
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.008
(grunting)

775
00:40:29.635 --> 00:40:31.262
(whimpering)

776
00:40:34.014 --> 00:40:35.391
I can fight my own fights.

777
00:40:36.725 --> 00:40:37.935
No, you can't.

778
00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.895
Those farmers aren't gonna quit

779
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:41.689
until they've got you
and every member of your family

780
00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:44.817
nailed upside-down to a bloody stick
with your eyes gorged out.

781
00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:48.154
This is getting a little too personal.

782
00:40:49.822 --> 00:40:50.906
Give me a minute.

783
00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:56.787
(muttering unintelligibly)

784
00:41:06.755 --> 00:41:07.798
I've got an idea.

785
00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:09.383
-What is it?
-It could be a good one.

786
00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:11.135
-Lay it on us.
-It might save our lives.

787
00:41:11.218 --> 00:41:12.303
Say the idea!

788
00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:14.722
All right. Let's try it.

789
00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:18.809
Go to the flint-mine,
tell Mrs. Badger <i>et al.</i>

790
00:41:18.893 --> 00:41:20.186
that help is on the way.

791
00:41:20.269 --> 00:41:21.854
Is help on the way?

792
00:41:21.937 --> 00:41:23.439
I sure as cuss hope so.

793
00:41:29.862 --> 00:41:33.324
Ash, I know what it's like to feel...

794
00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:35.951
different.

795
00:41:37.411 --> 00:41:38.496
I'm not different.

796
00:41:39.455 --> 00:41:40.664
Am I?

797
00:41:40.748 --> 00:41:43.334
We all are. Him, especially.

798
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.754
But there's something kind of
fantastic about that, isn't there?

799
00:41:52.593 --> 00:41:55.846
Hmm. Not to me.
I'd prefer to be an athlete.

800
00:41:57.932 --> 00:41:59.058
Gentlemen,

801
00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:02.770
this time, we must dig
in a very special direction.

802
00:42:08.108 --> 00:42:09.860
We gotta kinda feel out the vibe.

803
00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:15.407
Begin.

804
00:42:33.509 --> 00:42:35.010
(Mr. Fox snarling)

805
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.181
(thuds)

806
00:42:39.515 --> 00:42:43.435
Whoo-hoo! Come on! You guys...
You're not... Come on.

807
00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:52.736
I hit it slap in the middle.
Do you get how incredible this is?

we've only made matters worse.

849
00:44:55.317 --> 00:44:56.485
We should have stayed out of it.

850
00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:09.790
(panting)

851
00:45:16.714 --> 00:45:18.006
(exclaiming angrily)

852
00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:23.929
(bubbling, beeping)

853
00:45:29.643 --> 00:45:30.811
I've got an idea.

854
00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:33.480
(playing piano)

855
00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:42.489
I'm still not getting a signal.
Is anybody getting reception?

856
00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:43.657
BADGER: I don't have any signal,

857
00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:45.284
but I haven't had any...
I've had a problem with that.

858
00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:47.244
Crisp up those ducks.
Drag those chickens.

859
00:45:47.327 --> 00:45:48.662
Slow 'em down just a little bit.
We're a little ahead.

860
00:45:48.746 --> 00:45:50.706
Where are the apples?
Still out? Still have 'em raw?

861
00:45:50.789 --> 00:45:52.332
Well, slice them up.
Let's get them in the pan.

862
00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.084
I can imagine how painful,

863
00:45:54.168 --> 00:45:56.587
even just emotionally,
that must be for you.

864
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.213
Oh, you know, it's not
the end of the world.

865
00:45:58.297 --> 00:46:00.090
Oh, but, Foxy, how humiliating,

866
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:02.050
having your whole tail
blown clean off by--

867
00:46:02.134 --> 00:46:03.218
Can we drop it?

868
00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:09.391
Yeah, really good,
sweet, and nice.

869
00:46:09.475 --> 00:46:11.518
Hey. (whistles)
They say you're a natural.

870
00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:12.686
True or false?

871
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.188
-I was...
-Answer the question.

872
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:15.981
-True, I guess.
-Correct.

873
00:46:16.064 --> 00:46:17.065
Get outta here, Agnes.

874
00:46:17.149 --> 00:46:18.650
I need a private word
with Kristofferson.

875
00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:20.402
Wait, just a minute.
She doesn't...

876
00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:21.945
I don't mind. I'm gonna
go talk to the...

877
00:46:22.488 --> 00:46:25.824
Listen to me. I just had a brainstorm
for something fantastic

878
00:46:25.908 --> 00:46:27.993
I've got to do.
But I can't do it alone.

879
00:46:28.076 --> 00:46:29.703
-I'm not interested.
-Hear me out.

880
00:46:29.787 --> 00:46:32.039
No, thanks. I think foxes from
your side of the family

881
00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.415
take unnecessary risks.

882
00:46:33.499 --> 00:46:36.084
Only because they've got the guts
in their blood.

883
00:46:36.168 --> 00:46:37.169
And so do we.

884
00:46:37.878 --> 00:46:40.506
-Was I a bit rude to Agnes?
-Yeah.

885
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:41.965
I should probably say something,
shouldn't I?

886
00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:43.175
I'll say something to her
in a minute.

887
00:46:44.802 --> 00:46:45.928
What's the brainstorm?

888
00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:47.638
-In a nutshell?
-Uh-huh.

889
00:46:47.721 --> 00:46:50.015
We're going to steal back
my dad's tail.

890
00:46:50.098 --> 00:46:53.477
Whoa! (whistles)
Whew! Hmm.

891
00:47:01.527 --> 00:47:02.903
-(beeps)
-BEAN (over radio):<i> Okay, chief.</i>

892
00:47:02.986 --> 00:47:04.112
Here we go.

893
00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:08.450
(cider gushing)

894
00:47:16.375 --> 00:47:18.877
Well, (chuckles) it took
a near catastrophe

895
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:20.546
for all of you to finally take me up
on my offer

896
00:47:20.629 --> 00:47:22.297
to have you over
to the flint-mine for dinner.

897
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:23.382
But I guess we have--

898
00:47:23.465 --> 00:47:25.634
I'm sorry. Maybe my invitation
got lost in the mail.

899
00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:27.678
(chuckling) Does anybody know
what this badger's talking about?

900
00:47:27.761 --> 00:47:28.762
(all laughing)

901
00:47:28.846 --> 00:47:30.806
No, no. No, but Clive's right.
In all seriousness,

902
00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.099
excuse me, B.

903
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:37.104
I guess we do have these three
ugly farmers to thank for one thing.

904
00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:39.815
Reminding us to be thankful
and aware of each other.

905
00:47:40.232 --> 00:47:42.693
I'm gonna say it again. Aware.

906
00:47:51.785 --> 00:47:53.370
(exhilarating music playing)

907
00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:59.001
-I don't feel safe.
-That's because we're not.

908
00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.296
You should probably put
your bandit hat on now.

909
00:48:02.379 --> 00:48:05.257
Personally, I don't have one,
but I modified this tube sock.

910
00:48:08.343 --> 00:48:10.345
-We look good.
-Yeah, we do.

911
00:48:10.721 --> 00:48:12.389
Now, where would you keep
a prized tail,

912
00:48:12.472 --> 00:48:14.266
if you collected them,
if that was your hobby?

913
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:16.059
I'd probably hang it
over the mantelpiece.

914
00:48:16.143 --> 00:48:17.603
(snaps fingers) Right.
Good. In fact...

915
00:48:17.686 --> 00:48:19.354
(sniffing)
What's that smell?

916
00:48:22.774 --> 00:48:25.944
Ever tasted one of Mrs. Bean's
famous nutmeg-ginger-apple-snaps?

917
00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:28.739
Well, how do you do?

918
00:48:35.913 --> 00:48:36.955
They are so warm.

919
00:48:37.456 --> 00:48:38.624
(both snarling)

920
00:48:41.209 --> 00:48:43.420
-Uh-oh. We got it wrong.
-What?

921
00:48:43.503 --> 00:48:44.880
It's not over the mantelpiece.

922
00:48:46.256 --> 00:48:47.341
The necktie.

923
00:48:47.424 --> 00:48:48.508
(door opening)

924
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.952
-(shushing)
-(whispering) Let's go!

925
00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:16.161
-Hang on.
-What?

926
00:49:16.244 --> 00:49:17.496
-Two more.
-She's there.

927
00:49:17.579 --> 00:49:18.622
She can't see.

928
00:49:18.705 --> 00:49:19.748
(both gasp)

929
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:22.501
(both screaming)

930
00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:25.462
(slow, enchanting music playing)

931
00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:28.090
Look at each other.
Here we are. Wow.

932
00:49:28.674 --> 00:49:31.134
Now, I've already had too much
to drink and I'm feeling sentimental,

933
00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:32.928
but I'm gonna
say something anyway,

934
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:35.389
which nobody wants to admit,
but I think is probably true.

935
00:49:36.431 --> 00:49:39.226
We beat them.
We beat those farmers

936
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:41.812
and now we're triumphantly
eating their roasted chicken,

937
00:49:41.895 --> 00:49:43.981
their sizzling duck,
their succulent turkey,

938
00:49:44.064 --> 00:49:45.399
their <i>foie gras...</i>

939
00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:49.111
-Where'd the boys go?
-MRS. FOX: Wha... Where...

940
00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:51.780
-Ash? Kristofferson?
-Boys?

941
00:49:52.864 --> 00:49:54.074
Oh, my God.
That was crazy.

942
00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.492
I can't believe
what just happened in there.

943
00:49:55.575 --> 00:49:57.244
Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go! Where are we?

944
00:49:57.327 --> 00:49:58.787
Where are we?
Where are we? Wha...

945
00:50:01.957 --> 00:50:03.291
Kristofferson?

946
00:50:03.375 --> 00:50:04.876
What am I hearing again, baby?

947
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.045
What's happening?
Am I still paranoid?

948
00:50:07.129 --> 00:50:08.547
(rumbling)

949
00:50:10.757 --> 00:50:11.883
Cider.

950
00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:30.777
(all screaming)

951
00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:35.032
(animals coughing)

952
00:50:35.115 --> 00:50:36.825
What just happened?
Something with cider.

953
00:50:36.908 --> 00:50:38.702
That was dangerous. Is anyone hurt?

954
00:50:38.785 --> 00:50:42.039
We're all hurt. My entire flint-mine
just got demolished.

955
00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:44.374
Apple juice. Apple juice flood.

956
00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:45.459
Let's do a head count.

957
00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.794
Everybody pick a buddy.
Where'd the boys go?

958
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:50.380
-Ash! Kristofferson! Ash!
-Ash!

959
00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:51.590
ASH: I'm here!

960
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.342
-MR. FOX: Ash. Who's your buddy?
-Kristofferson.

961
00:50:54.426 --> 00:50:55.510
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

962
00:50:55.594 --> 00:50:56.720
-Why not?
-I lost him.

963
00:50:56.803 --> 00:50:57.888
You lo...
You lost him?

964
00:50:57.971 --> 00:50:59.306
-I lost him. We were in the kitchen.
-Where were you?

965
00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:01.558
I was in the kitchen. I was...
We were trying to find the necktie.

966
00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:02.893
What are you talking about?

967
00:51:02.976 --> 00:51:04.311
It's my fault.

968
00:51:04.394 --> 00:51:07.814
Oh, no. Where did you get
that nutmeg-ginger-apple-snap,

969
00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.025
and why are you wearing
that fake bandit hat?

970
00:51:10.484 --> 00:51:12.069
We went to steal back your tail.

971
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:13.570
(gasping)

972
00:51:15.072 --> 00:51:17.991
MR. FOX AND ASH:
Kristofferson!

973
00:51:24.623 --> 00:51:26.792
Wrap this wet little mutt
in a newspaper

974
00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.211
and put him in a box with some holes
punched in the top.

975
00:51:30.712 --> 00:51:32.214
There's only one way
out of the sewer,

976
00:51:32.297 --> 00:51:33.673
but the manhole cover's closed

977
00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:35.133
and there's a station wagon
parked on it.

978
00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:37.469
Which means we're permanently
stuck down here.

979
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.847
You still think we beat them, Foxy?

980
00:51:49.189 --> 00:51:51.441
(sniffling)

981
00:51:55.445 --> 00:51:58.115
(melancholy music playing)

982
00:51:59.866 --> 00:52:00.867
Badger's right.

983
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.203
These farmers aren't going to quit
until they catch me.

984
00:52:04.037 --> 00:52:05.413
I shouldn't have lied to your face

985
00:52:05.497 --> 00:52:06.957
I shouldn't have fallen off the wagon

986
00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.626
and started secretly stealing
chickens on the sly.

987
00:52:09.709 --> 00:52:11.586
I shouldn't have
pushed these farmers so far

988
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:13.922
and tried to embarrass them
and cuss with their heads.

989
00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.924
I enjoyed it,
but I shouldn't have done it.

990
00:52:16.007 --> 00:52:17.592
And now, there's only one way out.

991
00:52:18.468 --> 00:52:20.720
Maybe if I hand myself over
and let them kill me,

992
00:52:20.804 --> 00:52:22.597
stuff me and hang me
over their mantelpiece...

993
00:52:22.681 --> 00:52:23.932
You'll do no such thing.

994
00:52:24.015 --> 00:52:26.059
Darling, maybe they'll let
everyone else live.

995
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:31.648
(sorrowfully) Oh, why did you have to
get us into this, Foxy?

996
00:52:33.692 --> 00:52:35.986
I don't know,
but I have a possible theory.

997
00:52:37.112 --> 00:52:38.196
I think I have this thing

998
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.865
where I need everybody
to think I'm the greatest,

999
00:52:39.948 --> 00:52:42.492
the "Fantastic Mr. Fox."

1000
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:44.536
And if they aren't
completely knocked out

1001
00:52:44.619 --> 00:52:46.329
and dazzled
and kind of intimidated by me

1002
00:52:46.413 --> 00:52:48.456
then I don't feel good
about myself.

1003
00:52:49.457 --> 00:52:52.002
Foxes traditionally like
to court danger,

1004
00:52:52.085 --> 00:52:53.920
hunt prey
and outsmart predators.

1005
00:52:54.004 --> 00:52:55.547
And that's what
I'm actually good at.

1006
00:52:56.965 --> 00:52:58.717
I think, at the end of the day,
I'm just...

1007
00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.678
I know. We're wild animals.

1008
00:53:02.095 --> 00:53:03.221
Hmm.

1009
00:53:03.597 --> 00:53:04.931
I guess we always were.

1010
00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.810
I promise you, if I had all this
to do over again,

1011
00:53:08.894 --> 00:53:10.520
I'd have never let you down.

1012
00:53:10.604 --> 00:53:13.064
It was always more fun
when we did it together, anyway.

1013
00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:17.777
-I love you, Felicity.
-I love you too.

1014
00:53:20.155 --> 00:53:21.907
But I shouldn't have married you.

1015
00:53:32.375 --> 00:53:34.794
Did I ever tell you about the time
I learned we were gonna have a cub?

1016
00:53:34.878 --> 00:53:36.296
-In the fox trap.
-Right.

1017
00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:38.506
-We were at gunpoint, and mother--
-Said she's pregnant.

1018
00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:39.716
Let me tell it, okay?

1019
00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:42.802
I had no idea how we were gonna
get out of this jam,

1020
00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:43.970
and then it hit me.

1021
00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.972
What do foxes do
better than any other animal?

1022
00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:47.474
-Dig.
-You're stepping on my lines.

1023
00:53:47.557 --> 00:53:49.226
-Right. Keep telling it.
-So we dug.

1024
00:53:49.309 --> 00:53:52.729
And the whole time I put paw over paw,
scooping dirt and pebble,

1025
00:53:52.812 --> 00:53:54.731
with your mother digging like crazy
beside me,

1026
00:53:54.814 --> 00:53:57.567
I kept wondering,
"Who is this little boy going to be?"

1027
00:53:57.651 --> 00:53:58.860
-Or girl.
-Or girl. Right.

1028
00:53:58.944 --> 00:54:00.195
Because at that point, we didn't know.

1029
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:04.491
Ash, I'm so glad he was you.

1030
00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:08.536
It's not your fault. It's mine.

1031
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.706
(enchanting music playing)

1032
00:54:22.175 --> 00:54:24.552
(whistles, clicks tongue)

1033
00:54:31.017 --> 00:54:32.269
Good-bye.

1034
00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:38.608
Well, I guess we should,

1035
00:54:38.692 --> 00:54:41.611
uh, probably split into
a certain number of groups

1036
00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.239
and start doing something, right?

1037
00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:49.452
(whimpering)

1038
00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:51.830
(clearing throat)

1039
00:54:51.913 --> 00:54:53.331
Could I have a glass of water?

1040
00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.209
(panting)

1041
00:54:56.293 --> 00:54:59.546
Uh... Excuse me. Excuse me!

1042
00:55:00.046 --> 00:55:03.800
Kristofferson! Hello!
Can you hear us?

1043
00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.720
Kristofferson!

1044
00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.346
RAT: They got the boy.

1045
00:55:11.516 --> 00:55:13.143
(sinister music playing)

1046
00:55:13.226 --> 00:55:15.645
They want to trade the son
for his papa.

1047
00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:23.737
BADGER: Why'd they write this
in letters cut out of magazines?

1048
00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.030
To protect their identities.

1049
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:28.241
Oh, right.
But then why'd they sign their names?

1050
00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:29.534
Plus we already knew who they were

1051
00:55:29.617 --> 00:55:30.869
because they're trying to kill us.

1052
00:55:30.952 --> 00:55:33.371
BADGER: "Mr. Fox, we have your son.

1053
00:55:33.455 --> 00:55:35.040
If you ever want to see him
alive again..."

1054
00:55:35.123 --> 00:55:37.125
ASH: You took the wrong fox!

1055
00:55:40.295 --> 00:55:41.713
I'm his son.

1056
00:55:43.256 --> 00:55:45.133
I can see the resemblance.

1057
00:55:45.216 --> 00:55:46.551
(screams aggressively)

1058
00:55:47.385 --> 00:55:48.511
What was that?

1059
00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:50.847
ASH: (echoing) Dad!

1060
00:55:51.931 --> 00:55:54.184
(Ash screaming)

1061
00:55:55.435 --> 00:55:56.603
(gasps)

1062
00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:58.938
(grunting)

1063
00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:05.945
(growling)

1064
00:56:08.114 --> 00:56:09.866
Stop, man, come on, stop!

1065
00:56:09.949 --> 00:56:11.910
(exclaims, grunts)

1066
00:56:14.621 --> 00:56:16.956
(whoops, laughs)

1067
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.083
Look at you, girl.

1068
00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:22.670
You're still as fine-looking
as a creme brulee.

1069
00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:26.925
Am I being flirted with
by a psychotic rat?

1070
00:56:30.512 --> 00:56:31.554
(hissing)

1071
00:56:33.598 --> 00:56:35.892
-MRS. FOX: Ash!
-ASH: Let me out!

1072
00:56:35.975 --> 00:56:39.938
-(Rat growling)
-Excuse me. May I cut in?

1073
00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:42.315
(growls)

1074
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.484
-(Mrs. Fox grunts)
-(Rat hisses)

1075
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:47.987
(both grunting)

1076
00:56:55.453 --> 00:56:58.331
(Rat exclaiming in pain)

1077
00:57:04.796 --> 00:57:06.923
(Rat groaning weakly)

1078
00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:11.219
(choking weakly)

1079
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.265
(softly)
The boy's locked in an apple crate

1080
00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:19.936
on top of a gun locker
in the attic of Bean Annex.

1081
00:57:22.188 --> 00:57:24.357
Would you have told me
if I didn't kill you first?

1082
00:57:25.817 --> 00:57:26.901
Never.

1083
00:57:28.111 --> 00:57:31.906
All these wasted years.
What were you looking for, Rat?

1084
00:57:32.365 --> 00:57:33.533
(Rat stammering weakly)

1085
00:57:33.616 --> 00:57:35.160
He's trying to say something, Dad.

1086
00:57:37.036 --> 00:57:38.163
Cider.

1087
00:57:43.501 --> 00:57:45.128
MR. FOX: Here you are, Rat.

1088
00:57:45.211 --> 00:57:48.798
A beaker of Bean's finest
secret cider.

1089
00:57:53.595 --> 00:57:55.722
(weakly) like melted gold.

1090
00:57:56.514 --> 00:57:57.682
(moaning softly)

1091
00:58:05.023 --> 00:58:08.902
-He redeemed himself.
-Redemption, sure.

1092
00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:11.946
But in the end,
he's just another dead rat

1093
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.324
in a garbage pail
behind a Chinese restaurant.

1094
00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:32.884
-He went bananas.
-Yes, he did.

1095
00:58:34.886 --> 00:58:36.387
My suicide mission has been canceled.

1096
00:58:36.471 --> 00:58:38.806
We're replacing it with a go-for-broke
rescue mission.

1097
00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:43.811
In a way, I'm almost glad
that flood interrupted us,

1098
00:58:43.895 --> 00:58:46.856
because I don't like the toast
I was giving. I'm going to start over.

1099
00:58:49.275 --> 00:58:50.902
("Grand Choral" playing)

1100
00:58:50.985 --> 00:58:52.487
When I look down this table,

1101
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.531
with the exquisite feast
set before us,

1102
00:58:54.614 --> 00:58:57.283
I see two terrific lawyers,

1103
00:58:57.367 --> 00:58:59.369
a skilled pediatrician,
a wonderful chef,

1104
00:58:59.452 --> 00:59:01.579
a savvy real estate agent,
an excellent tailor,

1105
00:59:01.663 --> 00:59:03.623
a crack accountant,
a gifted musician,

1106
00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:05.458
a pretty good minnow fisherman,
and possibly,

1107
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:08.169
the best landscape painter
working on the scene today.

1108
00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:11.589
Maybe a few of you might even
read my column from time to time.

1109
00:59:11.673 --> 00:59:12.924
Who knows?
I tend to doubt it.

1110
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:17.512
I also see a room
full of wild animals.

1111
00:59:18.304 --> 00:59:21.849
Wild animals with true natures
and pure talents.

1112
00:59:22.308 --> 00:59:24.644
Wild animals with scientific-sounding
Latin names

1113
00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.354
that mean something about our DNA.

1114
00:59:26.437 --> 00:59:29.482
Wild animals, each with his own
strengths and weaknesses

1115
00:59:29.566 --> 00:59:30.900
due to his or her species.

1116
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.487
Anyway, I think it may very well be

1117
00:59:34.571 --> 00:59:37.615
all the beautiful differences
among us that might just give us

1118
00:59:37.699 --> 00:59:40.285
the tiniest glimmer
of a chance of saving my nephew

1119
00:59:40.368 --> 00:59:41.452
and letting me make it up to you

1120
00:59:41.536 --> 00:59:44.163
for getting us into
this crazy whatever-it-is.

1121
00:59:44.622 --> 00:59:46.082
I don't know, it's just a thought.

1122
00:59:46.499 --> 00:59:48.876
Thank you for listening.
Cheers, everyone.

1123
00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:52.255
(imitates glass shattering)

1124
00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:53.756
KYLIE: Let's eat!

1125
00:59:56.217 --> 00:59:58.845
What? I was just playing along
with the bit he was doing.

1126
01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:01.347
Will you join me?

1127
01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.100
I will.

1128
01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:09.063
-ALL: Oh, all right, I guess.
-Thank you.

1129
01:00:10.648 --> 01:00:13.234
All right, let's start planning.
Who knows shorthand? Great.

1130
01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.112
Linda, <i>Lutra lutra.</i>
You got some dry paper? Here we go.

1131
01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:19.407
-Mole, <i>Talpa europea.</i> What do you got?
-I can see in the dark.

1132
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.575
That's incredible. We can use that.

1133
01:00:20.658 --> 01:00:21.659
-Linda?
-Got it.

1134
01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.911
-Rabbit, <i>Oryctolagus cuniculus.</i>
-I'm fast.

1135
01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.747
-You bet you are. Linda?
-Got it.

1136
01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:27.665
-Beaver, <i>Castor fiber.</i>
-I chew through wood.

1137
01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:29.125
-Amazing! Linda!
-Got it.

1138
01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:31.544
-Badger, <i>Meles meles!</i>
-Demolitions expert.

1139
01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.714
-What? Since when?
-Explosions, flames, burning things!

1140
01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.883
-Demolitions expert. Okay, Linda?
-Got it.

1141
01:00:36.966 --> 01:00:40.219
-Weasel, <i>Mustela nivalis!</i>
-Stop yelling!

1142
01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.388
(whooping excitedly)
All right.

1143
01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:44.307
MR. FOX: Ash, you get
these little kids organized

1144
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.059
and put together
some kind of K.P. unit

1145
01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.477
or something to keep this sewer clean.

1146
01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.561
It's good for morale.

1147
01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:52.148
-Done. What's K.P.?
-Um, I think it means janitors.

1148
01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:55.026
FIELD MOUSE: Hey, hey.

1149
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:59.697
Me. Yo, over here, hey.
I want to go. I want to fight.

1150
01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.909
Good. Fabulous.
<i>Microtus pennsylvanicus.</i>

1151
01:01:03.701 --> 01:01:05.578
(chuckling)

1152
01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:09.791
I didn't get a job yet.
Or a Latin name. What's my strength?

1153
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.503
Listen, you're Kylie.
You're an unbelievably nice guy.

1154
01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:16.589
Your job is really
just to be available, I think.

1155
01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.757
I don't know your Latin name.

1156
01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.884
I doubt they even had
opossums in ancient Rome.

1157
01:01:29.435 --> 01:01:31.396
-It's stupendous! Where's us?
-Right here.

1158
01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:32.605
Paint an X.

1159
01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:37.110
MR. FOX: <i>Dear Farmers</i>
<i>Boggis, Bunce and Bean,</i>

1160
01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.487
<i>I have no alternative</i>
<i>but to agree to your terms.</i>

1161
01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:41.656
<i>Move the station wagon</i>
<i>and open the manhole cover</i>

1162
01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:44.033
<i>below the foot of the drainpipe</i>
<i>next to the cobbler shop</i>

1163
01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:45.952
<i>and meet me there today</i>
<i>at 10:00 a.m. sharp.</i>

1164
01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.412
<i>I will hand myself over to you</i>

1165
01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:49.247
<i>in exchange</i>
<i>for the boy's safe return.</i>

1166
01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:50.832
Cordially, Mr. Fox.

1167
01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.961
Why'd he write this
in letters cut out of magazines?

1168
01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:57.004
BOGGIS: I don't know,
but you did the same thing.

1169
01:01:57.088 --> 01:01:59.757
I don't trust this guy.
Anyway, set up the ambush.

1170
01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:04.095
Synchronize your clocks.
The time is now 9:45 a.m.

1171
01:02:04.178 --> 01:02:05.221
(watches beeping)

1172
01:02:05.304 --> 01:02:06.556
Here, put these bandit hats on.

1173
01:02:17.775 --> 01:02:18.818
(electricity crackles)

1174
01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:20.695
(engine sputtering)

1175
01:02:28.786 --> 01:02:32.123
(solemn instrumental music playing)

1176
01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:37.253
(ticking)

1177
01:02:37.336 --> 01:02:39.255
(beeping)

1178
01:03:02.904 --> 01:03:03.988
Did you bring the boy?

1179
01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:07.533
Of course we did.
Say something, kid.

1180
01:03:09.327 --> 01:03:11.579
KRISTOFFERSON (over tape player):
Excuse me. Excuse me!

1181
01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.873
Come on. That doesn't
sound anything like him.

1182
01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.708
It's amateur night in Dixie.

1183
01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.254
(blows)

1184
01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.219
What the cuss is he burning?

1185
01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:30.473
CHILDREN (whispering):
<i>Boggis, Bunce, Bean.</i>

1186
01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:34.268
<i>One fat, one short, one lean.</i>

1187
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:40.358
(all laughing)

1188
01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:42.026
Is that all you've got, Mr. Fox?

1189
01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.738
<i>♪ Boggis Bunce and Bean ♪</i>

1190
01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.824

1193
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.247
It's unclear whether these...

1194
01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:56.624
(alarm bell ringing)

1195
01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.837
<i>♪ Boggis Bunce and Bean ♪</i>

01:04:06.926 --> 01:04:08.469
(all exclaiming in pain)

1200
01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.600
28 pinecones fired,
22 targets hit.

1201
01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:20.064
Decoy phase, go.

1202
01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:22.859
Yes, sir. <i>Domino Santo...</i>
(mutters unintelligibly)

1203
01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.697
(whooping)

1204
01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.366
(all exclaiming)

1205
01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:38.124
(stammering) Dad's on fire!

1206
01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.542
(exclaiming)

1207
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.004
Foxy, you're on.

1208
01:04:43.087 --> 01:04:44.213
We're ready.

1209
01:04:45.214 --> 01:04:47.174
I'm going to find him
and I'm gonna bring him back.

1210
01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:48.551
I know you will.

1211
01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:50.428
Contact!

1212
01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.930
("Grand Choral" playing)

1213
01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:06.986
Are you scared of wolves?

1214
01:05:07.486 --> 01:05:09.530
Scared? No.
I have a phobia of them.

1215
01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:12.575
-I have a thing about thunder.
-Why? That's stupid.

1216
01:05:12.658 --> 01:05:14.118
I don't like needles myself.

1217
01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:17.079
Where'd you come from again?
How did you get in the sidecar?

1218
01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:18.289
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

1219
01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:20.541
(tires screeching)

1220
01:05:21.709 --> 01:05:24.462
PILOT: I've got a fox on a motorcycle,
with a littler fox

1221
01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:27.465
and what looks like to be
an opossum in the sidecar,

1222
01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:29.342
riding north on Farm Lane Seven.

1223
01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:31.469
Does that sound like
anything to anybody?

1224
01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:33.471
BEAN:
(over radio) Red, it's Franklin Bean.

1225
01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:36.766
Turn around, get the cuss back here
and pick us up on the ASAP.

1226
01:05:36.849 --> 01:05:37.892
(flipping switches)

1227
01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.001
All right, here we go.

1228
01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.169
Ah!

1229
01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:10.925
-Kylie, you got a credit card?
-Sure.

1230
01:06:11.008 --> 01:06:13.177
See? This is what I was saying
about how good you are,

1231
01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.345
just being available.

1232
01:06:14.428 --> 01:06:17.473
A titanium card?
How the cuss did you qualify for this?

1233
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.726
I pay my bills on time.
I've always had good credit.

1234
01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.816
(exclaims in delight)

1235
01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:28.526
(whistles, clicks tongue)

1236
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:31.112
-Come on.
-Wa... Wait a second.

1237
01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:33.155
What's this thing you do?
The whistle with the clicking sound?

1238
01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.283
What do you mean?
That's my trademark.

1239
01:06:36.367 --> 01:06:37.368
(whistles, clicks tongue)

1240
01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:45.960
(exhilarating music playing)

1241
01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:09.233
Give me a blueberry.

1242
01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:11.110
What?

1243
01:07:11.485 --> 01:07:12.945
-Blueberry.
-Huh? You didn't say anything...

1244
01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.405
You forgot the blueberries?

1245
01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:16.407
I did say it. I wrote it on your paw!

1246
01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:17.908
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1247
01:07:17.992 --> 01:07:19.577
It's written on the front of your paw.

1248
01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.665
What's that white stuff
around his mouth?

1249
01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:26.333
I think he eats soap.

1250
01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.592
-That's not soap.
-Then why does he have that bubbly...

1251
01:07:34.675 --> 01:07:37.887
He's rabid. With rabies.
I've heard about this beagle.

1252
01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.475
You two go ahead
while I distract him.

1253
01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:48.147
(toy squeaks)

1254
01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:50.274
(door creaking open)

1255
01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:52.359
Huh? Wha...

1256
01:07:53.694 --> 01:07:54.820
(shushes)

1257
01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.242
ASH: Hey.

1258
01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:03.829
I can fit through there.

1259
01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:05.790
Hmm?

1260
01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:08.417
-You want to know why?
-Why?

1261
01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.669
Because I'm little.

1262
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:12.755
Give me that shoelace.

1263
01:08:14.298 --> 01:08:17.843
(Ash breathing heavily)

1264
01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:22.932
Psst! Psst!

1265
01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.850
(whispering) It's me.
I'm rescuing you.

1266
01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:28.687
I've got mixed feelings
about that.

1267
01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:30.773
I don't blame you.

1268
01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.570
Can you give me
a karate lesson real quick?

1269
01:08:38.364 --> 01:08:40.449
Okay.
Stand like this.

1270
01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:43.035
Position yourself
on the balls of your feet.

1271
01:08:43.119 --> 01:08:45.996
Close your eyes.
You weigh less than a slice of bread.

1272
01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:51.836
I feel there's a tenderness
in your eyes, isn't there?

1273
01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:53.546
Yes, I'm right.

1274
01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.714
Let's revie
the principal agility techniques:

1275
01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.883
jumping, flipping, landing.

1276
01:08:58.384 --> 01:08:59.760
MR. FOX: You're a good boy.

1277
01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:02.596
A little lonely, maybe,
but terribly sweet.

1278
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.933
Is your name Spitz?
That's German, isn't it?

1279
01:09:06.976 --> 01:09:09.895
Now, for a rudimentary version
of the cyclone chop.

1280
01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.355
First, need to get a running start,

1281
01:09:11.438 --> 01:09:12.690
which, obviously, I can't do in here.

1282
01:09:12.773 --> 01:09:14.608
Then, as you arrive
at the destination of the chop,

1283
01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.402
lean and thrust into the
point of contact,

1284
01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.779
paw remains open and straight,
then withdraw instantaneously.

1285
01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.322
Remember, it's the pull-back
that matters.

1286
01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:23.159
The pull-back generates
the force of the impact.

1287
01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:24.493
Got it.

1288
01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.831
Yeah, I'm just going to
chop this thing right off.

1289
01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:36.213
(chanting)

1290
01:09:39.049 --> 01:09:40.092
He's going to do it.

1291
01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:45.764
Why, you're just
as sweet as a...

1292
01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.766
(growling)

1293
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.561
I thought he said
never look a beagle in the eye.

1294
01:09:50.644 --> 01:09:53.439
(grunting)

1295
01:09:58.903 --> 01:09:59.987
(gasping)

1296
01:10:00.946 --> 01:10:02.865
Did... Did you chop it?

1297
01:10:02.948 --> 01:10:04.450
(softly) Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

1298
01:10:05.618 --> 01:10:07.703
-(Kristofferson exclaiming in panic)
-(thuds)

1299
01:10:07.786 --> 01:10:09.121
(growling)

1300
01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:12.124
(snarling)

1301
01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:14.126
-(Spitz barking)
-(Mr. Fox screaming)

1302
01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:19.840
ASH: Kristofferson?

1303
01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:21.383
Kristofferson?

1304
01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.093
Uh, I'm okay.

1305
01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:25.471
I'm okay.

1306
01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.223
I'm sorry.

1307
01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:30.809
That's all right. You were just trying
to unlock the apple crate.

1308
01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:35.147
No. I mean I'm sorry
about... If...

1309
01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.232
Oh, you mean from before.

1310
01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:38.359
The apology you owed me,
but never actually said.

1311
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.071
Right. I'm grumpy. I spit.

1312
01:10:42.154 --> 01:10:43.739
I wake up on
the wrong side of the bed.

1313
01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:47.243
I'm just...
different, apparently.

1314
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:49.828
But it won't happen again.

1315
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.581
Kristofferson, I'm sorry.

1316
01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:56.669
Well, that's all right too.

1317
01:10:58.295 --> 01:10:59.380
Throw me the shoelace, please.

1318
01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:02.675
(panting)

1319
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.513
(barking furiously)

1320
01:11:09.139 --> 01:11:10.391
(gasping)

1321
01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:12.559
You okay?

1322
01:11:29.493 --> 01:11:30.744
(gasps)

1323
01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:37.293
(helicopter blades whirring)

1324
01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:40.004
(somber music playing)

1325
01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.510
He's wearing it.

1326
01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:55.477
Your tractors uprooted my tree,
your posse hunted my family,

1327
01:11:55.561 --> 01:12:00.399
your gunmen kidnapped my nephew,
your rat insulted my wife,

1328
01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.693
and you shot off my tail.

1329
01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:06.238
I'm not leaving here
without that necktie.

1330
01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:08.490
Kill him!

1331
01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.159
(gunfire)

1332
01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.502
Actually, we should just go.
Where did I park?

1333
01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.921
I weigh less than a slice of bread.

1334
01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.631
-What?
-ASH: I'll be right back.

1335
01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.008
-Ash!
-(gunfire)

1336
01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.386
-(grunting)
-(gunfire)

1337
01:12:34.558 --> 01:12:37.603
Dodge the grabbers, duck the taggers,
jump the twig-basket

1338
01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.938
and knock the cedar-stick
off the cross-rock!

1339
01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.231
(gunshots)

1340
01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:47.988
Hee-yah!

1341
01:12:48.447 --> 01:12:49.698
(Ash whoops)

1342
01:12:58.874 --> 01:13:00.125
Hot box!

1343
01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.296
-(barking)
-(all screaming)

1344
01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.842
(laughing)

1345
01:13:08.926 --> 01:13:10.761
(Spitz snarling)

1346
01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:24.400
-(Spitz barking)
-(all exclaiming in fear)

1347
01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:28.153
(gunfire)

1348
01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:32.533
Ash, that was
pure wild animal craziness.

1349
01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:34.118
You're an athlete.

1350
01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:35.369
Mm-hmm.

1351
01:13:35.452 --> 01:13:36.995
Here, put this bandit hat on.

1352
01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:41.750
Goggles.

(all exclaiming in panic)

1359
01:13:55.431 --> 01:14:00.269
MR. FOX (shouting):
Holy swearing cuss!

1360
01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.569
(Spitz barking, snarling)

1361
01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.448
Petey, bring us a ladder, please.

1362
01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:14.992
MOLE: Stand by!

1363
01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:17.828
I just intercepted a high-frequency
radio signal with the can.

1364
01:14:17.911 --> 01:14:19.663
And I think
they're on their way home!

1365
01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:21.415
(all cheering, whooping)

1366
01:14:28.672 --> 01:14:31.091
-Don't turn around.
-What?

1367
01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:33.802
(tires screeching)

1368
01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:38.807
(captivating music playing)

1369
01:14:40.267 --> 01:14:41.518
Where'd he come from?

1370
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:44.855
Where'd you come from?

1371
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:47.733
What are you doing here?

1372
01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:51.278
Canis lupus.

1373
01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.614
Vulpes vulpes.

1374
01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.701
I don't think
he speaks English or Latin.

1375
01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.413
(speaking French)

1376
01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:04.791
I'm asking if he thinks
we're in for a hard winter.

1377
01:15:09.379 --> 01:15:10.422
He doesn't seem to know.

1378
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:15.302
I have a phobia of wolves!

1379
01:15:31.401 --> 01:15:32.903
What a beautiful creature.

1380
01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.031
-Wish him luck, boys.
-Good luck to you.

1381
01:15:36.114 --> 01:15:37.366
-Good luck, wolf.
-Good luck out there.

1382
01:15:51.588 --> 01:15:54.675
(train chugging)

1383
01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.807
These three,
in this reporter's opinion,

1384
01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.100
obsessed farmers

1385
01:16:03.183 --> 01:16:06.478
remain convinced the fox in question
will eventually reappear.

1386
01:16:06.853 --> 01:16:09.856
-Why?
-Foxes aren't meant to live in sewer.

1387
01:16:09.940 --> 01:16:11.149
--They're refugees.
-All they have to eat

1388
01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.694
-down there is, umm...
-Trash!

1389
01:16:13.777 --> 01:16:15.237
And not much of it.

1390
01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:16.738
Uh-huh.

1391
01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:20.951
Thank you, farmers.
For Action 12, this is Dan Peabody.

1392
01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.330
-What are we looking at?
-It's just his tonsils.

1393
01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.832
-They are a little swollen.
-Is it serious?

1394
01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.500
No. Hopefully,
he won't have to lose them.

1395
01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:29.918
Lose the tonsils?

1396
01:16:30.752 --> 01:16:31.920
I'm hungry.

1397
01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.090
Well, have some,
um, water. Here.

1398
01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:37.175
-BEAVER: We try to keep things simple.
-I like wallpapers.

1399
01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:38.468
WEASEL: This is the first time
I've been to a party where

1400
01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:40.304
no one serves anything.

1401
01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.767
(cubs chanting)

1402
01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.110
My darlings.

1403
01:16:56.653 --> 01:16:58.280
-ASH: Where are we going?
-MR. FOX: Nobody knows.

1404
01:16:58.363 --> 01:17:00.115
ASH: We were in the middle
of a meditation practice.

1405
01:17:00.198 --> 01:17:03.076
Watch your step.
Let's see now, where does this lead?

1406
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.537
Oh, no. Foxy, it's filthy.

1407
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.081
-MR. FOX: Keep a good grip, everyone.
-This better be worth it.

1408
01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:11.585
MR. FOX: I think I see
a little sliver of light.

1409
01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.295
What's this? Is it a door?

1410
01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:15.213
You're a terrible actor, Foxy.

1411
01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.966
Do you smell something?
Is that (sniffs) Freon?

1412
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.385
(shushes) I'm going to
crack open this trap door

1413
01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.012
and see if something's
on the other side.

1414
01:17:22.095 --> 01:17:24.723
I highly doubt it, though.
There's probably just more sewer.

1415
01:17:25.932 --> 01:17:27.851
-Wouldn't it be surprising if--
-ASH: Open it.

1416
01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.319
Hey, look,
there's a whole enormous, glorious,

1417
01:17:37.402 --> 01:17:38.945
gigantic supermarket up here.

1418
01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.490
And they close early on weekends.

1419
01:17:41.573 --> 01:17:43.116
(all exclaiming in wonder)

1420
01:17:46.119 --> 01:17:50.540
You really are
kind of a "fantastic fox."

1421
01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:51.917
I try.

1422
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.210
Get enough to share with everybody.

1423
01:17:53.293 --> 01:17:55.170
And remember,
the Rabbits are vegetarians

1424
01:17:55.253 --> 01:17:57.172
and Badger supposedly
can't eat walnuts.

1425
01:17:57.255 --> 01:17:58.507
(all snarling)

1426
01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:01.343
I guess now that Kristofferson's dad

1427
01:18:01.426 --> 01:18:03.345
is already down to single pneumonia
and getting better,

1428
01:18:03.428 --> 01:18:04.888
he'll be going home soon, huh?

1429
01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.932
Actually, when he spoke to me
from the hospital,

1430
01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.308
he said he was
already talking to Weasel

1431
01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.144
about real estate availabilities
down in our sewer system.

1432
01:18:11.228 --> 01:18:12.813
Oh, really?
Well, now's the time to buy.

1433
01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:19.569
Ha!

1434
01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:24.074
Okay. I get it.
Is that your trademark?

1435
01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:30.539
-I'm pregnant again.
-(gasps) Wow.

1436
01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:34.710
I think we're both glowing.

1437
01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.920
(cheerful music playing)

1438
01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:39.589
Do another toast, Dad.

1439
01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:42.801
Okay, uh...

1440
01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:46.763
Let's see. Uh... Yeah. Right. Okay.

1441
01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:54.855
They say all foxes are slightly
allergic to linoleum.

1442
01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:56.189
But it's cool to the paw.

1443
01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.399
Try it.

1444
01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:03.447
They say my tail needs to be
dry-cleaned twice a month.

1445
01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.240
But now, it's fully detachable.

1446
01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:06.366
See?

1447
01:19:07.367 --> 01:19:10.495
They say our tree
may never grow back.

1448
01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.830
But one day, something will.

1449
01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:16.209
Yes, these crackles
are made of synthetic goose

1450
01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.670
and these giblets
come from artificial squab.

1451
01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:20.255
And even these apples look fake.

1452
01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.549
But at least
they've got stars on them.

1453
01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:25.635
I guess my point is,

1454
01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:28.305
we'll eat tonight,
and we'll eat together.

1455
01:19:28.388 --> 01:19:31.099
And even in this not particularly
flattering light,

1456
01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:34.102
you are, without a doubt,

1457
01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:37.481
the five and a half
most wonderful wild animals

1458
01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.608
I've ever met in my life.

1459
01:19:41.067 --> 01:19:42.861
So let's raise our boxes.

1460
01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:48.742
To our survival.

1461
01:19:50.076 --> 01:19:51.536
(all slurping)

1462
01:19:55.248 --> 01:19:56.291
How was that?

1463
01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.126
Mmm.

1464
01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.377
That was a good toast.
