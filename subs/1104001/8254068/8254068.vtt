you get here?

552
00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:23.389
Alan came over.

554
00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:28.749
Yeah. He got your page.

555
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:32.108
I found your office
under the arcade.

00:50:36.108 --> 00:50:37.388
Oh, the page.

558
00:50:38.708 --> 00:50:40.348
Of course.

559
00:50:44.388 --> 00:50:46.508
Clu had him on
the light cycle grid.

560
00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:48.748
I intervened.

561
00:50:49.388 --> 00:50:50.428
Oh.

562
00:50:52.588 --> 00:50:53.588
Dinner soon.

563
00:50:54.508 --> 00:50:56.948
We'll talk then.

564
00:51:10.908 --> 00:51:14.108
He never thought
he'd see you again.

565
00:51:16.348 --> 00:51:18.028
Yeah.

566
00:51:25.188 --> 00:51:29.547

cycles ago for the games.

out as much as it used to,

thing on the Grid.

00:52:02.107 --> 00:52:07.187
His patience usually beats out
my more aggressive strategy.

572
00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:13.827
Flynn shared them with me.

573
00:52:13.907 --> 00:52:15.747
I've read them all.

574
00:52:15.907 --> 00:52:18.667
Oh. Light reading.

579
00:52:29.426 --> 00:52:31.626
Flynn is teaching me
about the art of the selfless,

580
00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:36.426
about removing oneself
from the equation.

581
00:52:36.506 --> 00:52:41.346
But between you and me,
Jules Verne is my favorite.

582

583
00:52:43.826 --> 00:52:45.026
Sure.

I had ENCOM. I couldn't
be in here all the time.

Tell me, what brought
you here, to the Grid?

726
01:00:57.778 --> 01:00:59.658
Alan got your page.

727
01:00:59.738 --> 01:01:02.498
I didn't send any page.

728
01:01:02.978 --> 01:01:04.258
It was Clu.

729
01:01:04.338 --> 01:01:07.218
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

730
01:01:07.298 --> 01:01:10.298
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

731
01:01:10.338 --> 01:01:12.858
on the board to change the game!

732
01:01:12.898 --> 01:01:15.018
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

733
01:01:15.058 --> 01:01:17.538
This is precisely what he wants.

734
01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:20.217
Us together
heading for the portal.

735
01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:24.497
It's his game now. The
only way to win is not to play.

736
01:01:26.497 --> 01:01:28.417
Well, that's a hell
of a way to live.

737
01:01:28.497 --> 01:01:30.057
But it is a way.

738
01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.697
We can go home.

you past things like wants and hopes.

That's great, Dad.
Keep telling yourself that.

Good night, Sam.

743
01:02:22.256 --> 01:02:24.576
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

744
01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:27.816
I mean, he built Clu. Why
doesn't he just end him?

745
01:02:29.096 --> 01:02:31.216
He could, but it would
require reintegration.

746
01:02:31.256 --> 01:02:32.736
Yeah, all right.

747
01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:34.576
Flynn would never
survive the event.

748
01:02:34.736 --> 01:02:36.536
It would mean
the end of them both.

Clu wants Flynn's
disk, not mine.

I'm going to find Alan

754

out from the other side.

756
01:02:56.656 --> 01:02:58.776
but in my world, he's
gone in one keystroke.

757
01:02:58.856 --> 01:03:02.176
But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

in this place for eternity either.

A little help here maybe?

911
01:19:02.359 --> 01:19:03.639
SAM: Your disk.

912
01:19:04.599 --> 01:19:05.719
Dad, it's gone.

913
01:19:06.759 --> 01:19:08.039
It is.

914
01:19:10.759 --> 01:19:12.439
I'm sorry.
I know I messed up.

915
01:19:14.599 --> 01:19:15.639
We can go back.

916
01:19:15.759 --> 01:19:16.759
I can go back.

917
01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:18.439
No, we stay together.

918
01:19:18.519 --> 01:19:19.839
Dad, I can do this.

919
01:19:19.919 --> 01:19:21.359
You've done enough already!

920
01:19:26.879 --> 01:19:28.919
Sam, you're really...

921
01:19:31.599 --> 01:19:33.879
You're messing with
my Zen thing, man.

922
01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:37.799
She's stable.

923
01:19:38.919 --> 01:19:40.319
SAM: So what
do we do now?

924
01:19:40.399 --> 01:19:42.279
I don't know.
Nothing.

925
01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:45.199
We do nothing.

926
01:19:45.759 --> 01:19:47.279
Be still.

927
01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:51.519
Wait.

928
01:19:59.278 --> 01:20:02.118
You ever jump a freight train?

929
01:20:03.278 --> 01:20:04.318
Huh?

930
01:20:04.398 --> 01:20:07.638
We do it your way.
Full-on sprint to the portal.

931
01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:09.598
If we beat Clu there,
we have a chance.

932
01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.958
Let's get her out of here.

933
01:20:29.918 --> 01:20:31.638
This'll take us there.

934
01:20:58.557 --> 01:20:59.717
Is she gonna make it?

935
01:20:59.837 --> 01:21:01.037
I don't know.

936
01:21:01.117 --> 01:21:03.797
I've got to identify
the damaged code.

937
01:21:03.837 --> 01:21:07.437
The sequencing is just
enormously complex.

938
01:21:08.517 --> 01:21:10.597
SAM: But didn't
you write it?

939
01:21:10.677 --> 01:21:13.237
Some of it.
The rest of it is just

940
01:21:16.077 --> 01:21:18.637
beyond me.

941
01:21:19.877 --> 01:21:22.237
She's an ISO.

942
01:21:22.317 --> 01:21:24.757
KEVIN: Yeah.
The last ISO.

943
01:21:27.037 --> 01:21:28.437
SAM: All this time,

944
01:21:28.557 --> 01:21:30.877
you were just protecting her.

945
01:21:30.957 --> 01:21:34.997
KEVIN: She's the miracle, man.
Everything I ever worked for.

946

"A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition."

that was just a plug line.

948
01:21:43.997 --> 01:21:48.237
KEVIN: In our world,
she could change everything.

949
01:21:49.637 --> 01:21:51.757
Yeah.

950
01:21:53.556 --> 01:21:55.996
(LAUGHS)
Check that out.

951
01:22:04.116 --> 01:22:06.236
She risked herself for me.

952
01:22:08.196 --> 01:22:10.556
Some things are worth the risk.

953
01:22:24.076 --> 01:22:26.036
KEVIN: Look at this.

954
01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:32.516
Now, that is impressive
if I do say so myself. Huh?

955
01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:37.156
Come on, it's gonna take a
while for her system to reboot.

956
01:22:37.236 --> 01:22:40.436
Now it's time for you
to tell me a story.

957
01:22:58.595 --> 01:23:00.875
CLU: The boy
and Flynn are gone.

958
01:23:00.955 --> 01:23:04.795

Excellency, they perished in the elevator.

959
01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:09.795
You presume?

960
01:23:11.955 --> 01:23:14.155
Find them.

961
01:23:18.475 --> 01:23:21.835
SAM: Icecaps are melting,
war in the Middle East,

962
01:23:21.915 --> 01:23:24.075
Lakers/Celtics back at it.

963
01:23:25.195 --> 01:23:28.395
I don't know. Rich are getting
richer, poor are getting poorer.

964
01:23:28.475 --> 01:23:31.195
Cell phones,
online dating, Wi-Fi.

965
01:23:31.275 --> 01:23:32.755
KEVIN: What's Wi-Fi?

966
01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:34.355
Wireless interlinking.

967
01:23:34.475 --> 01:23:35.835
Of digital devices?

968
01:23:35.955 --> 01:23:37.315
Yeah.

969
01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:40.835
Hmm. I thought
of that in '85.

970
01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:43.075

971
01:23:45.475 --> 01:23:47.595
Mom and Dad are...

972
01:23:49.355 --> 01:23:50.715
I assume that...

973
01:23:50.795 --> 01:23:51.834
Yeah.

974
01:23:52.714 --> 01:23:53.794
Oh.

975
01:23:54.834 --> 01:23:57.194
Mac when I was 12

976
01:23:57.274 --> 01:24:00.194
and Gram five years later.

977
01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:06.874
You remember that night
when you didn't come home?

978
01:24:06.914 --> 01:24:08.154
Well...
You said...

979
01:24:08.194 --> 01:24:10.314
I said I'd show you the Grid.

980
01:24:12.354 --> 01:24:14.714
You should have seen
this place back then.

981
01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:20.954
I couldn't wait to show
it to you. Could not wait.

982
01:24:21.034 --> 01:24:23.554
SAM: Must have been
something before Clu screwed it up.

983
01:24:23.634 --> 01:24:25.394
No, no, he...

984
01:24:27.114 --> 01:24:29.834
He's me.
I screwed it up.

985
01:24:31.314 --> 01:24:33.434
Chasing after perfection.

986
01:24:35.514 --> 01:24:39.234
Chasing after what was
right in front of me.

987
01:24:39.754 --> 01:24:41.714
Right in front of me.

988
01:24:43.554 --> 01:24:45.954
Look what you've accomplished.

989
01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.114
It's incredible.

990
01:24:48.194 --> 01:24:49.554
Sam,

991
01:24:50.513 --> 01:24:53.833
I'd have given it all up
for one more day with you.

01:25:06.913 --> 01:25:07.953
Hey.

Remember your old Ducati?

995
01:25:10.913 --> 01:25:11.953
You kidding?

996
01:25:12.033 --> 01:25:14.193
Not a day goes by I
don't think about that bike.

997
01:25:14.273 --> 01:25:16.153
Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.

998
01:25:16.913 --> 01:25:18.233
You busted my bike?

999
01:25:18.273 --> 01:25:20.553
Twenty years in
the shed, no tarp.

1000
01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:23.993
I mean, she
needed a little love.

1001
01:25:24.073 --> 01:25:25.513
(LAUGHS)

1002
01:25:25.593 --> 01:25:27.153
How does she run?

1003
01:25:27.233 --> 01:25:31.233
Well, when I'm done,
better than ever.

1004
01:25:32.433 --> 01:25:34.993
Well, man, I'd like to see that.

1005
01:25:36.633 --> 01:25:38.153
You will.

1006
01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:42.633
Here.

1007
01:25:42.913 --> 01:25:45.353
She's rebooting.
Give her this.

1008
01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:49.272
The old man's gonna knock
on the sky, listen to the sound.

1009
01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:17.152
CASTOR: When Flynn
entered the space,

1010
01:26:17.592 --> 01:26:20.752
ah, everything changed.

1011
01:26:21.272 --> 01:26:23.872
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

1012
01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:26.952
The awe was

1013
01:26:27.832 --> 01:26:29.272
palpable.

1014
01:26:30.832 --> 01:26:31.872
Was it?

1015
01:26:31.992 --> 01:26:33.072
I presume

1016
01:26:33.712 --> 01:26:36.912
our understanding
is still valid?

1017
01:26:38.472 --> 01:26:40.592
Control of the city?

1018
01:26:41.192 --> 01:26:44.192
A size able request, I know.

1019
01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:47.112
But seemingly
fitting compensation.

1020
01:26:47.711 --> 01:26:49.151
Don't you think?

1021
01:26:50.511 --> 01:26:54.071
How long have you been
searching for this, Clu?

1022
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:57.831
About 1,000 cycles. No?

1023
01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:01.711
Just imagine
the secrets it holds.

1024
01:27:03.511 --> 01:27:04.591

any and all riddles

of the Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid...

1027
01:27:13.631 --> 01:27:15.431
But there's something else, too.

1028
01:27:15.991 --> 01:27:17.191
Isn't there?

1029
01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:19.111
I've heard the chatter

1030
01:27:19.231 --> 01:27:22.591
about this private initiative.

1031
01:27:32.111 --> 01:27:35.191
I realize that our alliance is,

1032
01:27:35.231 --> 01:27:36.711
at times,

1033
01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:38.231
uneasy.

1034
01:27:38.311 --> 01:27:40.311
But always necessary.

1035
01:27:42.071 --> 01:27:44.071
You know you need me

1036
01:27:44.151 --> 01:27:45.871
right where I am.

1037
01:27:45.911 --> 01:27:47.430
Clu?

1038
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:50.190
Of course you're right.

1039
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:52.750
Enjoy the drink.

Hey. It's okay.
We're safe for now.

We're heading east
towards the portal.

1047
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:22.550
Clu has the disk.

1048
01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:26.070
Once I get out,
I can shut him down.

1049
01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:31.750
I should never have sent
you to Zuse. It was a mistake.

1050
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:34.310
It's okay. I've
made a few myself.

1051
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:41.430
Where is he?

1052
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:45.229
SAM: I think he's
knocking on the sky.

1053
01:28:45.349 --> 01:28:47.469
QUORRA: And
listening to the sound.

1054
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:50.149
Yeah.

1055
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:52.709
How did you find him?

1056
01:29:02.189 --> 01:29:03.309
It's okay.

1057
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:07.509
I know.

1058
01:29:12.789 --> 01:29:15.109
QUORRA:
It was during the Purge.

1059
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:18.229
Clu was relentless.

1060
01:29:18.589 --> 01:29:21.949
The Black Guard were
executing ISOs in the streets.

1061
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:25.829
Everyone I knew disappeared.

1062
01:29:28.509 --> 01:29:30.549
Then they came for me.

1063
01:29:33.309 --> 01:29:35.229
So I ran.

1064
01:29:36.309 --> 01:29:39.589
A sympathetic program
smuggled me out of the city.

1065
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:42.189
But soon they had me surrounded.

1066
01:29:42.269 --> 01:29:44.308
I prepared for the end.

1067
01:29:44.468 --> 01:29:46.868
And just as everything
was going dark,

1068
01:29:47.428 --> 01:29:50.388
I felt a hand on my shoulder.

1069
01:29:53.108 --> 01:29:55.188
And when I opened my eyes,

1070
01:29:56.628 --> 01:30:01.028
standing above me
was the Creator.

1071
01:30:03.668 --> 01:30:05.428
Your father.

1072
01:30:07.028 --> 01:30:08.708
He saved me.

1073
01:30:12.948 --> 01:30:16.468
I guess you could
say I'm a rescue.

1074
01:30:35.548 --> 01:30:37.348
SAM: Hell of a view.

1075
01:30:37.468 --> 01:30:40.308
QUORRA: It used to let us
know that Flynn was here.

1076
01:30:40.388 --> 01:30:42.748
It became the symbol
of something bigger,

1077
01:30:42.827 --> 01:30:46.147
something better
than this world.

1078
01:30:46.907 --> 01:30:49.387
I've never been
this close before.

1079
01:30:50.547 --> 01:30:53.107
It's how I imagine
a sunrise to be.

1080
01:30:53.187 --> 01:30:55.507
Ah, trust me.
There's no comparison.

1081
01:30:58.947 --> 01:31:00.907

01:49:11.009 --> 01:49:12.329
There it is.

1262
01:49:12.929 --> 01:49:14.609
Take her down.

1263
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:17.009
Hang on.
This could be rough.

1264
01:50:09.368 --> 01:50:11.568
This is mine.

1265
01:50:16.728 --> 01:50:18.888
I had a feeling you'd be here!

1266
01:50:19.008 --> 01:50:22.847
(LAUGHS) The cycles
haven't been kind, have they?

1267
01:50:23.727 --> 01:50:26.047
Oh, you don't look so bad.

1268
01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:30.927
I did everything.
Everything you ever asked.

1269
01:50:31.447 --> 01:50:33.247
I know you did.

1270
01:50:33.287 --> 01:50:34.927
CLU:
I executed the plan!

1271
01:50:35.567 --> 01:50:36.687
As you saw it.

1272
01:50:36.767 --> 01:50:41.927
You... You promised that we
would change the world together.

1273
01:50:42.287 --> 01:50:44.487
You broke your promise. I know.

1274
01:50:44.727 --> 01:50:46.087
I understand that now.

1275
01:50:46.167 --> 01:50:49.647
I took this system
to its maximum potential.

1276
01:50:49.727 --> 01:50:51.887
I created the perfect system!

1277
01:50:51.927 --> 01:50:55.727
The thing about perfection
is that it's unknowable.

1278
01:50:56.847 --> 01:51:01.487
It's impossible but it's also
right in front of us all the time.

1279
01:51:01.607 --> 01:51:05.287
You wouldn't know that because
I didn't when I created you.

1280
01:51:07.047 --> 01:51:08.767
I'm sorry, Clu.

1281
01:51:10.927 --> 01:51:13.327
I'm sorry.

1282
01:51:25.766 --> 01:51:26.846
(YELLS)

1283
01:51:35.006 --> 01:51:36.286
Go.

1284
01:51:49.646 --> 01:51:50.846
Clu!

1285
01:51:51.726 --> 01:51:54.046
Remember what you came for.

1286
01:52:08.006 --> 01:52:09.046
Dad!

1287
01:52:09.166 --> 01:52:10.686
CLU: You knew
I'd beat you.

1288
01:52:10.806 --> 01:52:13.846
And still you did
all this? For him.

1289
01:52:20.045 --> 01:52:21.285
No.

1290
01:52:26.845 --> 01:52:28.165
No!

1291
01:52:28.205 --> 01:52:29.565
Why?

1292
01:52:31.245 --> 01:52:32.645
He's my son.

1293
01:52:39.005 --> 01:52:40.045
Go!

1294
01:52:45.885 --> 01:52:46.965
Dad!

1295
01:52:53.525 --> 01:52:55.685
Sam! It's time!

1296
01:52:55.885 --> 01:52:57.045
No!

1297
01:52:57.445 --> 01:53:00.245
Sam, it's what he wants.

1298
01:53:02.245 --> 01:53:04.205
I'm not leaving you!

1299
01:53:04.565 --> 01:53:06.085
Take her!

1300
01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:19.124
Yes!

1301
01:53:46.764 --> 01:53:48.484
Goodbye, kiddo.

1302
01:54:17.123 --> 01:54:19.163
(GROANS)

1303
01:54:19.803 --> 01:54:21.683
No!

1304
01:55:32.602 --> 01:55:34.442
SAM: Al?

1305
01:55:38.842 --> 01:55:40.682
ALAN:
You paged me?

1306
01:55:41.162 --> 01:55:42.842
Yeah.

1307
01:55:43.602 --> 01:55:45.882
I need you at ENCOM
at 8:00 a.m.

1308
01:55:47.842 --> 01:55:49.402
What about the board?

1309
01:55:51.002 --> 01:55:52.922
You're chairman now.

1310
01:55:55.242 --> 01:55:57.722
I'm taking
the company back, Alan.

1311
01:56:01.802 --> 01:56:03.042
Oh, and...

1312
01:56:04.282 --> 01:56:05.962
You were right.

1313
01:56:07.642 --> 01:56:09.082
About what?

1314
01:56:10.722 --> 01:56:12.282
About everything.

1315
01:56:37.161 --> 01:56:38.441
QUORRA:
What's next, Sam?

1316
01:56:44.241 --> 01:56:47.641
I guess we're supposed
to change the world.

1317
01:56:51.681 --> 01:56:54.441
Come on. I wanna
show you something.
