00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.079
<i>The Grid.</i>

2
00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:35.719
<i>A digital frontier.</i>

3
00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:39.799
<i>I tried to picture
clusters of information</i>

4
00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.119
<i>as they moved
through the computer.</i>

5
00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.599
<i>What did they look like?</i>

6
00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:47.879
<i>Ships? Motorcycles?</i>

7
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.199
<i>Were the circuits like freeways?</i>

8
00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:54.839
<i>I kept dreaming of a world
I thought I'd never see.</i>

9
00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:59.119
<i>And then, one day...</i>

10
00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.079
<i>You got in.</i>

11
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:03.679
<i>That's right, man.
I got in.</i>

12
00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:42.238
And the world was more
beautiful than I ever dreamed

13
00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.998
and also more dangerous
than I ever imagined.

14
00:01:45.078 --> 00:01:46.838
Hop in bed, now, kiddo.

15
00:01:48.318 --> 00:01:50.158
Now, I met a brave warrior.

16
00:01:50.238 --> 00:01:51.278
Tron.

17
00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:53.798
<i>♪ Bom-ba-bom-bom bom! ♪</i>

18
00:01:54.078 --> 00:01:55.438
Tron!

19
00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:57.038
He fights
for the users.

20
00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:58.518
He sure does.

21
00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:02.798
Oh, man, he showed me things
that no one had ever imagined.

22
00:02:02.838 --> 00:02:06.398
There were these disk battles
fought in spectacular arenas.

23
00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:09.278
Cycles that raced
on ribbons of light.

24
00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:11.838
It was so radical.

25
00:02:11.878 --> 00:02:12.878
And together...

26
00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.038
You built
the Grid.

27
00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:17.878
We built a new grid
for programs and users.

28
00:02:18.358 --> 00:02:20.278
Now, I couldn't be
in there all the time,

29
00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:25.438
so I created a program in
my own image that could think.

30
00:02:25.558 --> 00:02:27.638
Like you, and me.

31
00:02:27.718 --> 00:02:31.557
And I called him Clu.

32
00:02:31.997 --> 00:02:34.237
Codified Likeness Utility.

33
00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:35.397
That's right.

34
00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:39.477
And Clu, Tron and I,
we built the system,

35
00:02:39.557 --> 00:02:42.517
where all information
was free and open.

36
00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:44.717
Beautiful.

37
00:02:47.077 --> 00:02:49.557
And then, one day,

38
00:02:50.597 --> 00:02:52.477
something happened.

39
00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:58.757
Something extraordinary.

40
00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:03.197
A miracle.

41
00:03:06.997 --> 00:03:08.317
What was it?

42
00:03:09.597 --> 00:03:12.437
That'll have to
wait till next time.

43
00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:14.517
I gotta get to work.

44
00:03:14.597 --> 00:03:16.077
I wanna go with you, Dad.

45
00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:20.917
Yeah, well, one day you will.

46
00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:22.517
I promise.

47
00:03:22.597 --> 00:03:23.997
To the Grid?

48
00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:25.597
Good night, Sam.

49
00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:31.956
Hey, what do you say tomorrow
you and I hit the arcade?

50
00:03:31.996 --> 00:03:34.716
You can have a crack at
the old man's high score.

51
00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:35.996
First game's on me.

52
00:03:38.636 --> 00:03:41.756
Can we play doubles?
On the same team?

53
00:03:44.316 --> 00:03:46.756
We're always on the same team.

54
00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:10.316
<i>Good evening.
Our lead story.</i>

55
00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:15.156
<i>ENCOM CEO and video game icon
Kevin Flynn has disappeared.</i>

56
00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:18.316
<i>He was best known for designing</i>
Tron <i>and</i> Space Paranoids,

57
00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:21.156
<i>the two bestselling
video games in history.</i>

58
00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:24.356
<i>Flynn took ownership
of ENCOM in 1982</i>

59
00:04:24.436 --> 00:04:27.835
<i>as the company skyrocketed to
the top of the tech industry.</i>

60
00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:32.235
<i>But things changed in 1985 with
the untimely death of Flynn's wife,</i>

61
00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:34.835
<i>the mother of
his young son, Sam.</i>

62
00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:36.915
<i>Recently, ENCOM board members</i>

63
00:04:36.995 --> 00:04:38.235
<i>have been troubled by reports</i>

64
00:04:38.355 --> 00:04:41.355
<i>of Flynn's erratic,
even obsessive, behavior.</i>

65
00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:45.155
<i>With Flynn missing, the
company is now in chaos.</i>

66
00:04:45.195 --> 00:04:47.435
<i>This afternoon, ENCOM's board</i>

67
00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:50.675
<i>moved to seize control from
Flynn's partner, Alan Bradley,</i>

68
00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:53.755
<i>vowing to return the
company to profitability.</i>

69
00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:55.355
<i>Loyal to the end,</i>

70
00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:59.075
<i>Bradley maintains his belief
that Flynn is not missing</i>

71
00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:01.795
<i>and is instead
pursuing his dream of</i>

72
00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:05.315
<i>"a digital frontier to reshape
the human condition."</i>

73
00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:09.395
<i>In there
is a new world.</i>

74
00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:11.715
<i>In there is our future.</i>

75
00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:16.035
<i>In there is our destiny.</i>

76
00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:23.795
<i>Even Flynn's
most ardent supporters</i>

77
00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:26.274
<i>are now acknowledging
a difficult truth.</i>

78
00:05:26.354 --> 00:05:29.154
<i>Kevin Flynn may have
simply run away.</i>

79
00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:32.234
<i>And while Flynn's loyalists
hope for his imminent return,</i>

80
00:05:32.314 --> 00:05:34.714
<i>there is perhaps no one
who wishes it to happen more</i>

81
00:05:34.754 --> 00:05:36.194
<i>than young Sam Flynn,</i>

82
00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:38.234
<i>now in the care of
his grandparents,</i>

83
00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:40.394
<i>and heir to an empire
in turmoil.</i>

84
00:05:41.314 --> 00:05:44.074
He's coming.
He promised.

85
00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:45.114
Sam, you have to eat.

86
00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:46.194
Let go of me!

87
00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:47.514
Sam?

88
00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:50.874
<i>What will become of Flynn's
legacy and the future of ENCOM</i>

89
00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:52.114
<i>will most likely depend</i>

90
00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:55.594
<i>on what becomes of this
now orphaned little boy.</i>

91
00:05:57.674 --> 00:05:59.754
<i>Sam! Come back!</i>

92
00:06:08.954 --> 00:06:11.114
<i>All cycle
units, stand by.</i>

93
00:06:51.793 --> 00:06:53.593
<i>All units, stand by.</i>

94
00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:56.192
Now that is a big door.

95
00:07:56.272 --> 00:07:57.592
<i>Welcome, everybody.</i>

96
00:07:57.952 --> 00:08:01.192
Please settle. I know it's
late, so I'll skip the pleasantries

97
00:08:01.272 --> 00:08:05.032
and hand things over to our
chairman, Richard Mackey.

98
00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:09.952
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Claire.

99
00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:13.592
Tonight I am pleased to announce

100
00:08:13.672 --> 00:08:19.672
that ENCOM's last fiscal year
was our most profitable ever.

101
00:08:20.552 --> 00:08:21.591
Yes.

102
00:08:40.271 --> 00:08:43.791
At midnight the 12th version
of our flagship operating system

103
00:08:43.871 --> 00:08:46.231
will hit the shelves
around the world.

104
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:50.071
<i>I'm sure it comes as no
surprise whom we have to thank.</i>

105
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:52.271
The head of our
software design team,

106
00:08:52.351 --> 00:08:57.351
a man whose father's own
notable history with ENCOM

107
00:08:57.431 --> 00:09:00.191
helped make this company
what it is today.

108
00:09:02.711 --> 00:09:05.191
Edward Dillinger.
Well done.

109
00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:07.111
Well done.

110
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.071
And this year, simultaneous to
the release of ENCOM OS-12,

111
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:21.110
we will be making our debut
on Tokyo's Nikkei Index.

112
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:26.110
ENCOM's stock will now
trade around the world 24/7.

113
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.790
Huh? Oh, yes.

114
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.910
Excuse me.

115
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.350
Yes, Alan?

116
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.990
Given the prices

117
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.710
that we charge to
students and schools,

118
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.390
what sort of improvements
have been made in Flynn...

119
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.150
I mean, ENCOM OS-12?

120
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.910
This year we put
a "12" on the box.

121
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.029
OS-12 is the most secure
operating system ever released.

122
00:10:19.989 --> 00:10:23.829
The idea of sharing our
software or giving it away for free

123
00:10:24.349 --> 00:10:26.709
disappeared with Kevin Flynn.

124
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.429
I know you're here.

125
00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:44.909
Let's make this easy.

126
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:48.909
Come on, come on.

127
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:58.669
Freeze!

128
00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:00.509
<i>Okay.</i>

129
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:02.349
If there are no more questions,

130
00:11:02.869 --> 00:11:05.909
I would like you to meet
our next blockbuster.

131
00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:08.789
ENCOM OS-12.

132
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.069
Whoa.

133
00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:14.469
Still a few bugs.

134
00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:16.229
What's that?
What is that?

135
00:11:20.428 --> 00:11:22.308
Just bear with us one sec.

136
00:11:22.388 --> 00:11:24.668
Make this go away now.

137
00:11:24.748 --> 00:11:27.708
Stop what you're doing.
Stop. Stop for one second.

138
00:11:27.748 --> 00:11:31.868
<i>...where ENCOM's chairman,
Richard Mackey, will be launching...</i>

139
00:11:31.908 --> 00:11:33.548
We go live
in 30 seconds.

140
00:11:33.668 --> 00:11:35.308
He's on the roof!

141
00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:36.804
Anyone know where
the master file is?

142
00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:38.228
I do.

143
00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:40.908
It's on the Web.

144
00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:44.868
We've got to stop this.

145
00:11:48.948 --> 00:11:51.228
I've got to ring
that opening bell.

146
00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:52.788
Make this stop now.

147
00:11:52.868 --> 00:11:53.948
It's locked.

148
00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:56.948
Just shut it down.
Shut it down! Now!

149
00:11:56.988 --> 00:12:00.028
Relax, Mackey. Relax.

150
00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:01.428
It's under control.

151
00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:03.588
Relax?
Our most valuable

152
00:12:03.628 --> 00:12:07.188
and most secure operating
system is out there for free!

153
00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:08.948
How am I supposed
to explain that?

154
00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:11.988
I don't know. Say it
was all part of the plan.

155
00:12:13.028 --> 00:12:15.148
A little gift from ENCOM.

156
00:12:15.268 --> 00:12:16.987
<i>Apparently,
ENCOM Technology</i>

157
00:12:17.067 --> 00:12:19.507
<i>is having some
technical difficulties.</i>

158
00:12:20.627 --> 00:12:23.867
<i>Why don't we give them a
chance to sort things out?</i>

159
00:12:50.947 --> 00:12:52.947
Hey, Dad.

160
00:12:53.027 --> 00:12:54.827
How you doing?

161
00:13:00.827 --> 00:13:02.627
Where you
gonna run to now?

162
00:13:02.747 --> 00:13:04.507
Hey, you don't wanna do that.

163
00:13:04.587 --> 00:13:06.907
Didn't anyone
tell you? Stealing is wrong.

164
00:13:07.027 --> 00:13:09.627
You can't steal what
was designed to be free.

165
00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:10.947
Now I got you.

166
00:13:11.347 --> 00:13:12.867
Your boss is okay with this.

167
00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:14.227
The hell he is.

168
00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:16.466
Your boss works for the CEO

169
00:13:16.506 --> 00:13:18.186
and the CEO works
for the shareholders.

170
00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:20.546
Do you know who the
biggest shareholder is?

171
00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:23.186
I don't know.
Some kid.

172
00:13:27.346 --> 00:13:29.106
You're Mr. Flynn?

173
00:13:30.946 --> 00:13:32.506
Why?

174
00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:35.506
This is your father's company.

175
00:13:35.546 --> 00:13:37.226
Not anymore.

176
00:13:37.386 --> 00:13:39.106
What? Hey. Hey, kid.

177
00:13:39.186 --> 00:13:41.866
No!

178
00:13:53.746 --> 00:13:55.026
Yeah.

179
00:13:55.426 --> 00:13:57.826
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

180
00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:03.546
You kidding me?

181
00:14:04.506 --> 00:14:06.306
That's him! Get
the team down here!

182
00:14:06.426 --> 00:14:08.226
There he is!
Get him!

183
00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:11.386
What the...

184
00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:13.865
Hey! No free ride!

185
00:14:14.505 --> 00:14:15.705
Whoa!

186
00:14:15.825 --> 00:14:17.025
No free taxi!

187
00:14:17.225 --> 00:14:19.025
You pay!

188
00:14:21.665 --> 00:14:22.865
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

189
00:14:22.985 --> 00:14:24.265
No free ride!

190
00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:36.865
Hold
it right there. Freeze!

191
00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:42.145
Okay, boys.
You got me.

192
00:14:42.945 --> 00:14:44.105
Hey.

193
00:14:58.905 --> 00:14:59.945
Hey, Karl.

194
00:14:59.985 --> 00:15:00.985
Hey, how you doing?

195
00:15:16.984 --> 00:15:19.344
Enjoy it, Marv.
You earned it.

196
00:15:23.384 --> 00:15:25.224
Why are you
in my apartment, Alan?

197
00:15:27.104 --> 00:15:29.184
You don't answer your phone.

198
00:15:31.664 --> 00:15:33.664
How you been, Sam?
Oh, you know,

199
00:15:33.704 --> 00:15:37.424
when I was 12, I appreciated the
surrogate-father thing. But come on.

200
00:15:38.144 --> 00:15:40.024
I got it all under control now.

201
00:15:40.464 --> 00:15:42.544
Oh. Clearly!

202
00:15:42.624 --> 00:15:44.040
You want to help me
with my homework?

203
00:15:44.064 --> 00:15:45.464
Like old times?
Have a catch?

204
00:15:47.824 --> 00:15:51.344
You know, you got a
pretty nice view here.

205
00:15:53.824 --> 00:15:57.304
Heard you did a triple Axel
off of her a few hours ago.

206
00:15:58.344 --> 00:15:59.664
Rough landing, huh?

207
00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:01.184
Could have been worse.

208
00:16:01.224 --> 00:16:04.064
I also thought your
message to the board

209
00:16:04.144 --> 00:16:05.304
was very clever.

210
00:16:05.344 --> 00:16:07.864
Did you like that?
That was Marv's idea.

211
00:16:13.503 --> 00:16:16.303
Alan, are we really
going to do this again?

212
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:20.263
Do I really look like I'm ready
to run a Fortune 500 company?

213
00:16:20.743 --> 00:16:22.023
No.

214
00:16:22.223 --> 00:16:26.383
And truthfully, the company is
pretty happy with where you are, too.

215
00:16:26.703 --> 00:16:27.743
I bet.

216
00:16:27.863 --> 00:16:31.023
That way they can keep
doing whatever they want.

217
00:16:32.703 --> 00:16:37.143
You know, I guess what I find
curious is the crazy charities,

218
00:16:37.383 --> 00:16:39.703
the annual prank on the company.

219
00:16:40.063 --> 00:16:42.663
You have an interesting way
of being disinterested, Sam.

220
00:16:42.703 --> 00:16:44.543
Why are you here, Alan?

221
00:16:47.903 --> 00:16:49.663
I was paged last night.

222
00:16:49.743 --> 00:16:51.983
Oh, man, still
rocking the pager?

223
00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:53.663
Good for you.

224
00:16:53.743 --> 00:16:58.143
Yeah, your dad once told me I
had to sleep with it, and I still do.

225
00:16:59.303 --> 00:17:01.663
Page came from your
dad's office at the arcade.

226
00:17:05.423 --> 00:17:06.543
So?

227
00:17:06.663 --> 00:17:07.783
So?

228
00:17:08.943 --> 00:17:11.582
That number's been
disconnected for 20 years.

229
00:17:12.982 --> 00:17:16.582
Sam, two nights before he
disappeared, he came to my house.

230
00:17:16.742 --> 00:17:19.342
"I've cracked it,"
he kept saying.

231
00:17:19.422 --> 00:17:23.222
He was talking about genetic
algorithms, quantum teleportation.

232
00:17:23.342 --> 00:17:27.582
He said he was about to change
everything. Science, medicine, religion.

233
00:17:28.902 --> 00:17:31.182
He wouldn't have left that, Sam.

234
00:17:34.222 --> 00:17:35.582
He wouldn't have left you.

235
00:17:35.782 --> 00:17:39.302
Oh, Alan. You're the only
one who still believes that.

236
00:17:39.622 --> 00:17:42.502
He's either dead or
chilling in Costa Rica.

237
00:17:44.262 --> 00:17:45.262
Probably both.

238
00:17:45.822 --> 00:17:47.342
Look, I'm sorry.

239
00:17:47.422 --> 00:17:49.942
I'm tired,
and I smell like jail.

240
00:17:50.622 --> 00:17:52.702
Let's just reconvene in
another couple of years, huh?

241
00:17:52.742 --> 00:17:54.822
What do you say?

242
00:17:58.942 --> 00:18:00.182
Here.

243
00:18:01.382 --> 00:18:03.782
These are the keys
to the arcade.

244
00:18:04.622 --> 00:18:09.621
I haven't gone over there yet. I
thought you should be the one.

245
00:18:09.741 --> 00:18:13.141
Alan, you're acting like I'm gonna
find him sitting there working.

246
00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:17.061
Just, "Hey, kiddo.
Lost track of time."

247
00:18:20.621 --> 00:18:22.701
Wouldn't that be something?

248
00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:33.501
What?

249
00:21:49.418 --> 00:21:51.138
You son of a gun.

250
00:22:31.977 --> 00:22:33.537
Flynn.

251
00:22:39.497 --> 00:22:40.737
Huh.

252
00:22:41.897 --> 00:22:43.857
Let's try the back door.

253
00:22:47.897 --> 00:22:49.297
What were you working on?

254
00:22:56.177 --> 00:22:57.817
<i>Laser Control.</i>

255
00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:00.017
Okay.

256
00:23:40.576 --> 00:23:42.656
This isn't happening.

257
00:23:58.496 --> 00:24:00.376
Oh, man, this is happening.

258
00:24:09.495 --> 00:24:10.855
Wait.

259
00:24:12.335 --> 00:24:14.575
<i>This program has no disk.
Another stray.</i>

260
00:24:14.655 --> 00:24:15.655
Hey, wait.

261
00:24:15.895 --> 00:24:18.495
Wait. I'm not a program!

262
00:24:47.615 --> 00:24:49.455
He actually did it.

263
00:24:53.015 --> 00:24:54.575
I'm on the Grid.

264
00:25:04.214 --> 00:25:07.534
Does the name Kevin Flynn
mean anything to you?

265
00:25:07.614 --> 00:25:09.534
Be quiet if you want to live!

266
00:25:09.654 --> 00:25:11.894
Not the games,
not the games,

267
00:25:11.974 --> 00:25:14.374
not the games, not the games...

268
00:25:14.454 --> 00:25:15.854
What's his problem?

269
00:25:18.774 --> 00:25:20.654

tell me what the...

282
00:27:29.172 --> 00:27:31.452
Hey, hey.
It's got a zipper.

283
00:27:49.052 --> 00:27:50.532
He is different.

284
00:27:59.371 --> 00:28:00.491
This can't be good.

285
00:28:10.291 --> 00:28:12.411

00:28:48.131 --> 00:28:49.851
Where are you going?

294
00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:58.130
What am I supposed to do?

295
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.970
Survive.

296
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.849
<i>All combatants,

297
00:29:56.889 --> 00:30:00.409

You definitely didn't do that.

Damn it!

307
00:31:37.968 --> 00:31:39.528
So that's how it is.

Your initiative should be fully

Perhaps if you
were to include me

316

be of even greater service.

00:36:59.642 --> 00:37:02.402
Isn't this something?

362
00:37:02.522 --> 00:37:03.762
You look the same.

363
00:37:03.842 --> 00:37:07.002
A lot's happened, Sam. More
than you can imagine. Disk.

364
00:37:12.242 --> 00:37:13.922
Let's have a look.

365
00:37:29.882 --> 00:37:31.362
Got it.

366
00:37:31.802 --> 00:37:34.042
Hmm. I expected more.

367
00:37:37.642 --> 00:37:40.442
So, you were trapped in here.

368
00:37:40.482 --> 00:37:42.042
That's right.

369
00:37:45.202 --> 00:37:46.401
And you're in charge.

370
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:48.121
Right again.
You're two for two.

371
00:37:49.081 --> 00:37:51.641
So can we just go home now?

372
00:37:53.081 --> 00:37:54.961
Not in the cards.

373
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:57.441
Not for you.

374
00:38:01.521 --> 00:38:03.881
That's a hell of a way
to treat your son.

375
00:38:05.801 --> 00:38:07.681
Oh, that.

376
00:38:12.321 --> 00:38:14.881
I'm not your father, Sam.

377
00:38:16.681 --> 00:38:20.001
But I'm very, very
happy to see you.

378
00:38:23.281 --> 00:38:25.201
Clu.

379
00:38:27.961 --> 00:38:29.161
Where is he?

380
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:31.401
What did you do to him?

381
00:38:31.521 --> 00:38:36.041
Same thing I'm going
to do to you, user.

382
00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.400
Greetings, programs.

383
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.160
Oh, what an occasion
we have here before us.

384
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:11.640
Because your rumors are true.

385
00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:16.560
We do indeed have in our midst

386
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.720
a user!

387
00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.640
A user.

388
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.240
So, what to do?

389
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.600
What does this user deserve?

390
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.720
Might I suggest perhaps
the challenge of the Grid?

391
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:48.159
And who best to battle
this singular opponent?

392
00:39:49.479 --> 00:39:53.639
Perhaps one who has some
experience in these matters.

393
00:39:56.919 --> 00:39:58.759
Oh, yes, indeed, programs.

394
00:39:59.639 --> 00:40:02.159
Your liberator!

395
00:40:02.279 --> 00:40:03.879
Your luminary!

396
00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:07.079
Your leader and maker!

397
00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:12.439
The one who vanquished
the tyranny of the user

398
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.879
those many cycles before!

399
00:40:16.839 --> 00:40:19.439
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

400
00:40:19.479 --> 00:40:23.119
Clu!

401
00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:26.359
You wanna play?
I'll play.

402
00:40:32.679 --> 00:40:34.039
Excellent words, sir.

403
00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:37.639
Were you pleased
with my execution?

404
00:40:37.719 --> 00:40:40.479
The crowd seemed
quite energized.

405
00:40:41.959 --> 00:40:44.118
It wasn't
meant for them.

406
00:40:57.118 --> 00:40:58.998
What's this?

407
00:40:59.078 --> 00:41:00.918
What do I do with this?

408
00:41:00.998 --> 00:41:03.078
I'll give you a hint.

409
00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:05.318
Not that.

410
00:41:15.158 --> 00:41:16.718
<i>Grid is live.</i>

411
00:41:16.798 --> 00:41:20.238
<i>Initiate light cycle battle.</i>

412
00:41:35.158 --> 00:41:36.518
<i>You got no chance, user.</i>

413
00:41:36.558 --> 00:41:39.798
<i>Their bikes are faster
than ours. Use the levels.</i>

414
00:41:45.077 --> 00:41:47.197
Now this I can do.

415
00:42:19.557 --> 00:42:21.077
Here we go.

416
00:43:26.996 --> 00:43:28.476
Come on. Come on!

417
00:43:44.795 --> 00:43:47.795
Hey! We gotta
work together.

418
00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:49.915
It's the only way.

419
00:43:57.955 --> 00:44:00.515
That's it.
You got me.

420
00:44:08.435 --> 00:44:09.835
Boo!

421
00:44:12.835 --> 00:44:14.195
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

422
00:44:14.275 --> 00:44:16.435
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

423
00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:19.235
Another customer.
Let's go!

424
00:44:36.755 --> 00:44:38.194
Hang on, buddy, I'm coming.

425
00:44:47.314 --> 00:44:48.514
Come on.

426
00:45:02.114 --> 00:45:04.594
This is it. Come on.

427
00:45:34.114 --> 00:45:36.074
<i>Illegal combatant on the Grid.</i>

428
00:45:36.194 --> 00:45:37.593
Get in.

429
00:45:37.673 --> 00:45:39.273
<i>Illegal combatant on the Grid.</i>

430
00:45:39.313 --> 00:45:40.513
Get in!

431
00:45:46.633 --> 00:45:49.953
<i>System failure.
Release Rinzler.</i>

432
00:45:49.993 --> 00:45:51.993
Game on, old friend.

433
00:46:01.233 --> 00:46:02.793
Who are you?

434
00:46:02.953 --> 00:46:04.513
<i>Hang on.</i>

435
00:46:32.473 --> 00:46:34.033
Pull up, man,
you can't make that!

436
00:46:43.632 --> 00:46:45.992
<i>Made it.</i>

437
00:46:55.032 --> 00:46:56.272
I'm Quorra.

438
00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:02.992
They're turning around.

439
00:47:03.032 --> 00:47:04.472
Not by choice.

440
00:47:04.512 --> 00:47:06.272
Their vehicles
can't go off Grid.

441
00:47:06.392 --> 00:47:08.152
They'll malfunction
on this terrain.

442
00:47:08.192 --> 00:47:09.832
What about us?

443
00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:11.592
Obviously not.

444
00:47:19.192 --> 00:47:20.552
Where are you taking me?

445
00:47:20.672 --> 00:47:22.112
Patience, Sam Flynn.

446
00:47:22.912 --> 00:47:25.792
All your questions
will be answered soon.

447
00:47:34.191 --> 00:47:35.871
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

448
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.870
Wait here.

449
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.590
Quorra.

450
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.670
I dreamed of Tron.

451
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.790
First time in years.

452
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.910
It's a sign.

453
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.590
A sign, my dear
apprentice, of a weary soul.

454
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:01.230
I'm afraid
something's happened.

455
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.950
Something has happened.

456
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:05.830
We have a guest.

457
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.790
There are
no guests, kiddo.

458
00:49:33.389 --> 00:49:35.469
Sam...

459
00:49:36.509 --> 00:49:38.869
Long time.

460
00:49:40.349 --> 00:49:43.189
You have no idea.

461
00:49:48.949 --> 00:49:51.549
You're...
You're here.

462
00:49:55.629 --> 00:49:57.109
You're here.

463
00:49:57.949 --> 00:50:00.389
I'm here.

464
00:50:07.989 --> 00:50:09.509
You're big.

465
00:50:10.949 --> 00:50:12.789
You're...

466
00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:14.869
Old.

467
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:20.829
How did
you get here?

468
00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:23.389
Alan came over.

469
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:25.869
Bradley.

470
00:50:25.909 --> 00:50:28.749
Yeah. He got your page.

471
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:32.108
I found your office
under the arcade.

472
00:50:33.508 --> 00:50:34.988
Page...

473
00:50:36.108 --> 00:50:37.388
Oh, the page.

474
00:50:38.708 --> 00:50:40.348
Of course.

475
00:50:44.388 --> 00:50:46.508
Clu had him on
the light cycle grid.

476
00:50:46.548 --> 00:50:48.748
I intervened.

477
00:50:49.388 --> 00:50:50.428
Oh.

478
00:50:52.588 --> 00:50:53.588
Dinner soon.

479
00:50:54.508 --> 00:50:56.948
We'll talk then.

480
00:51:10.908 --> 00:51:14.108
He never thought
he'd see you again.

481
00:51:16.348 --> 00:51:18.028
Yeah.

482
00:51:25.188 --> 00:51:29.547
Vintage. Flynn built it many
cycles ago for the games.

483
00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:33.467
It doesn't get
out as much as it used to,

484
00:51:33.547 --> 00:51:36.587
but it's still the fastest
thing on the Grid.

485
00:51:59.587 --> 00:52:01.147
Do you know it?

486
00:52:02.107 --> 00:52:07.187
His patience usually beats out
my more aggressive strategy.

487
00:52:11.467 --> 00:52:13.827
Flynn shared them with me.

488
00:52:13.907 --> 00:52:15.747
I've read them all.

489
00:52:15.907 --> 00:52:18.667
Oh. Light reading.

490
00:52:19.467 --> 00:52:21.147
Tolstoy.

491
00:52:21.187 --> 00:52:23.467
Dostoyevsky.

492
00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:26.067
<i>I-Ching.
Journey Without Goal.</i>

493
00:52:26.987 --> 00:52:29.306
Must have a killer ending.

494
00:52:29.426 --> 00:52:31.626
Flynn is teaching me
about the art of the selfless,

495
00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:36.426
about removing oneself
from the equation.

496
00:52:36.506 --> 00:52:41.346
But between you and me,
Jules Verne is my favorite.

497
00:52:42.506 --> 00:52:43.746
Do you know Jules Verne?

498
00:52:43.826 --> 00:52:45.026
Sure.

499
00:52:46.026 --> 00:52:48.586
What's he like?

500
00:52:58.026 --> 00:53:00.386
Your move, Flynn, come on.

501
00:53:01.306 --> 00:53:03.866
Come on!

502
00:53:25.506 --> 00:53:27.585
How old
are you now, Sam?

503
00:53:27.705 --> 00:53:29.865
You should be 27.

504
00:53:30.905 --> 00:53:32.905
Yes, 27.

505
00:53:32.945 --> 00:53:34.545
Do you
attend a college?

506
00:53:34.745 --> 00:53:36.385
Caltech.

507
00:53:37.745 --> 00:53:41.544
Caltech.
My Alma mater.

508
00:53:41.545 --> 00:53:42.905
Yeah.

509
00:53:42.985 --> 00:53:44.665
Till I dropped out.

510
00:53:54.065 --> 00:53:55.225
Work?

511
00:53:55.905 --> 00:53:57.305
Job?
ENCOM? Are you...

512
00:53:57.385 --> 00:53:58.745
No.

513
00:54:00.985 --> 00:54:03.425
I check in once a year.

514
00:54:04.745 --> 00:54:05.745
Wife, girlfriend?

515
00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:06.865
Dog.

516
00:54:07.425 --> 00:54:09.745
Marvin.

517
00:54:09.865 --> 00:54:10.865
A rescue.

518
00:54:10.985 --> 00:54:11.985
Well, dogs...

519
00:54:12.065 --> 00:54:13.785
Dogs are cool.

520
00:54:22.825 --> 00:54:26.784
I'm sure you must have a few
questions of your own, Sam.

521
00:54:29.104 --> 00:54:31.144
Actually, just one.

522
00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.544
Why I never came home.

523
00:54:40.384 --> 00:54:43.144
Those nights when
I went to the office,

524
00:54:43.224 --> 00:54:46.544
I'm sure you've figured it out
by now, I was coming here.

525
00:54:47.624 --> 00:54:50.464
Human form into digital space.

526
00:54:50.544 --> 00:54:52.624
Heavy stuff.

527
00:54:54.584 --> 00:54:56.824
But I also had you.

528
00:54:56.904 --> 00:55:00.344
I had ENCOM. I couldn't
be in here all the time.

529
00:55:00.424 --> 00:55:03.144
I needed partners to help out.

530
00:55:03.224 --> 00:55:04.944
Tron and Clu?

531
00:55:05.744 --> 00:55:06.904
That's right.

532
00:55:09.584 --> 00:55:13.024
<i>Tron was created
by Alan for the old system.</i>

533
00:55:13.104 --> 00:55:15.303
<i>I brought him here
to protect this one.</i>

534
00:55:15.304 --> 00:55:17.624
<i>Clu was my creation.</i>

535
00:55:17.664 --> 00:55:21.504
<i>A program designed
to create a perfect world.</i>

536
00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:25.423
We were jamming, man,
building utopia.

537
00:55:25.503 --> 00:55:28.023
Hours in here were
just minutes back home.

538
00:55:28.103 --> 00:55:30.903
Just when I thought it
couldn't get any more profound,

539
00:55:30.983 --> 00:55:33.183
something unexpected happened.

540
00:55:33.783 --> 00:55:35.063
The miracle.

541
00:55:35.783 --> 00:55:37.703
The miracle.

542
00:55:37.783 --> 00:55:39.463
You remember.

543
00:55:40.783 --> 00:55:43.983
ISOs.
Isomorphic algorithms.

544
00:55:44.783 --> 00:55:46.583
A whole new life form.

545
00:55:47.223 --> 00:55:48.503
And you created them?

546
00:55:53.103 --> 00:55:54.583
No. No.

547
00:55:54.663 --> 00:55:58.263
They manifested, like a flame.

548
00:55:58.343 --> 00:56:01.223
They weren't really
from anywhere.

549
00:56:01.343 --> 00:56:04.223
The conditions were right
and they came into being.

550
00:56:05.263 --> 00:56:09.143
<i>For centuries we've dreamed
of gods, spirits, aliens,</i>

551
00:56:09.223 --> 00:56:11.263
<i>an intelligence beyond our own.</i>

552
00:56:11.343 --> 00:56:12.663
You seeing this?

553
00:56:12.703 --> 00:56:17.383
<i>I found them in here.
Like flowers in a wasteland.</i>

554
00:56:20.303 --> 00:56:22.903
<i>Profoundly naive.</i>

555
00:56:24.542 --> 00:56:27.342
<i>Unimaginably wise.</i>

556
00:56:29.022 --> 00:56:31.222
They were spectacular.

557
00:56:31.302 --> 00:56:34.142
Everything I'd hoped
to find in the system,

558
00:56:34.222 --> 00:56:36.742
control, order, perfection,

559
00:56:36.822 --> 00:56:38.222
none of it meant a thing.

560
00:56:38.262 --> 00:56:39.702
I'd been living in
a hall of mirrors.

561
00:56:40.582 --> 00:56:43.302
The ISOs shattered it.

562
00:56:43.382 --> 00:56:46.942
The possibilities of their
root code, their digital DNA.

563
00:56:47.022 --> 00:56:49.462
Disease? History.

564
00:56:50.262 --> 00:56:51.902
Science, philosophy,

565
00:56:51.942 --> 00:56:56.222
every idea man has ever had
about the universe up for grabs.

566
00:56:56.262 --> 00:56:59.102
Bio-digital jazz, man.

567
00:56:59.902 --> 00:57:03.422
<i>The ISOs, they were going
to be my gift to the world.</i>

568
00:57:03.502 --> 00:57:05.902
<i>So what happened?</i>

569
00:57:05.942 --> 00:57:09.422
Clu.
Clu happened.

570
00:57:12.622 --> 00:57:15.382
Your transport to
the portal is waiting for you.

571
00:57:15.462 --> 00:57:17.622
I don't like it when
you cut it this close.

572
00:57:17.702 --> 00:57:21.782
Will you stop worrying,
Tron? Everything's just fine.

573
00:57:21.822 --> 00:57:22.901
Everything's under control.

574
00:57:22.941 --> 00:57:23.981
Flynn!

575
00:57:28.781 --> 00:57:31.381
Am I still to create
the perfect system?

576
00:57:32.901 --> 00:57:34.501
Yeah.

577
00:57:37.861 --> 00:57:39.021
<i>It was a coup.</i>

578
00:57:41.461 --> 00:57:42.461
Go.

579
00:57:57.061 --> 00:57:58.621
<i>You've been corrupted.</i>

580
00:58:08.661 --> 00:58:11.501
Why? Why?

581
00:58:14.221 --> 00:58:15.341
Flynn, go!

582
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.580
<i>Tron,
he fought for me.</i>

583
00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.340
<i>I never saw him again.</i>

584
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.860
So why didn't you fight?

585
00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.220
Hmm.

586
00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.340
He did.

587
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:36.180
Clu fed
on my resistance.

588
00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:39.020
The more I fought, the
more powerful he became.

589
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.820
It was impressive, really.

590
00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:47.300
<i>And my miracle... Clu saw
the ISOs as an imperfection.</i>

591
00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.860
<i>So he destroyed them.</i>

592
00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:54.780
The Purge.

593
00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.220
He killed them all?

594
00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.300
It was genocide.

595
00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.500
<i>I tried to get back but I
couldn't get to the portal.</i>

596
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:08.500
<i>It uses massive power and
it can't stay open forever.</i>

597
00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.620
<i>And like a safe, it...</i>

598
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.460
<i>It can only be opened
from the outside.</i>

599
00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.220
It closed on me, Sam.

600
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.219
That's why I never came home.

601
00:59:29.219 --> 00:59:31.419
So the portal, it activated

602
00:59:31.459 --> 00:59:34.259
when I came in.
So it's open now.

603
00:59:34.339 --> 00:59:35.379
Not for long.

604
00:59:35.419 --> 00:59:38.099
Only one millicycle,
about eight hours.

605
00:59:38.139 --> 00:59:41.539
So we go now. Go home.
We make a run for it.

606
00:59:41.579 --> 00:59:42.579
We get you out of here.

607
00:59:42.739 --> 00:59:43.739
Don't rush.

608
00:59:43.859 --> 00:59:46.059
What do you mean?
The portal's gonna close.

609
00:59:48.219 --> 00:59:49.859
What? What is it?

610
00:59:49.939 --> 00:59:51.779
The moment Flynn is on the Grid,

611
00:59:51.819 --> 00:59:54.019
Clu will stop at nothing
to obtain his disk.

612
00:59:54.099 --> 00:59:56.179
My disk is everything, Sam.

613
00:59:56.259 --> 00:59:59.739
It's the master key. The
golden ticket. The way out.

614
01:00:00.819 --> 01:00:02.539
And not just for me.

615
01:00:02.659 --> 01:00:04.339
What do you mean?

616
01:00:04.459 --> 01:00:07.139
Our worlds are more
connected than anyone knows.

617
01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:09.459
Clu figures if I can be in...

618
01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:11.219
He can be out?

619
01:00:11.299 --> 01:00:13.019
With my
disk, it's possible.

620
01:00:13.139 --> 01:00:14.899
And then what?

621
01:00:15.499 --> 01:00:17.299
Game over.

622
01:00:18.099 --> 01:00:20.898
The guy doesn't
dig imperfection.

623
01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:24.938
What's more imperfect
than our world?

624
01:00:26.458 --> 01:00:29.818
I can't let that
happen. I won't.

625
01:00:30.218 --> 01:00:33.418
So what do we do?
Nothing?

626
01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:36.458
It's amazing how productive
doing nothing can be.

627
01:00:36.498 --> 01:00:40.138
Clu's planning something.
We've known that for a while.

628
01:00:40.578 --> 01:00:41.938
Programs have been disappearing.

629
01:00:41.978 --> 01:00:44.658
There's unrest out there,
even revolution.

630
01:00:44.738 --> 01:00:48.978
If we sit tight, Clu might be
brought down from the inside.

631
01:00:49.018 --> 01:00:51.018
If the portal is
closing, we can't sit around.

632
01:00:51.098 --> 01:00:52.378
We have to move now.

633
01:00:52.458 --> 01:00:57.298
Tell me, what brought
you here, to the Grid?

634
01:00:57.778 --> 01:00:59.658
Alan got your page.

635
01:00:59.738 --> 01:01:02.498
I didn't send any page.

636
01:01:02.978 --> 01:01:04.258
It was Clu.

637
01:01:04.338 --> 01:01:07.218
Clu sent that page.
That's why you're here.

638
01:01:07.298 --> 01:01:10.298
This is all his design.
He wanted a new piece

639
01:01:10.338 --> 01:01:12.858
on the board to change the game!

640
01:01:12.898 --> 01:01:15.018
With you, he got more
than he ever dreamed.

641
01:01:15.058 --> 01:01:17.538
This is precisely what he wants.

642
01:01:17.698 --> 01:01:20.217
Us together
heading for the portal.

643
01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:24.497
It's his game now. The
only way to win is not to play.

644
01:01:26.497 --> 01:01:28.417
Well, that's a hell
of a way to live.

645
01:01:28.497 --> 01:01:30.057
But it is a way.

646
01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:36.697
We can go home.

647
01:01:38.577 --> 01:01:40.537
Don't you want that?

648
01:01:41.217 --> 01:01:46.697
Sometimes life has a way of moving
you past things like wants and hopes.

649
01:01:47.417 --> 01:01:52.177
That's great, Dad.
Keep telling yourself that.

650
01:01:57.817 --> 01:01:59.017
Good night, Sam.

651
01:02:22.256 --> 01:02:24.576
How can he be so afraid
of his own creation?

652
01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:27.816
I mean, he built Clu. Why
doesn't he just end him?

653
01:02:29.096 --> 01:02:31.216
He could, but it would
require reintegration.

654
01:02:31.256 --> 01:02:32.736
Yeah, all right.

655
01:02:32.816 --> 01:02:34.576
Flynn would never
survive the event.

656
01:02:34.736 --> 01:02:36.536
It would mean
the end of them both.

657
01:02:36.936 --> 01:02:40.256
If he refuses to
save himself, then I will.

658
01:02:44.416 --> 01:02:46.136
How?

659
01:02:46.216 --> 01:02:48.736
I'm going through the portal.

660
01:02:48.776 --> 01:02:50.576
Clu wants Flynn's
disk, not mine.

661
01:02:50.616 --> 01:02:51.856
I'm going to find Alan

662
01:02:51.936 --> 01:02:55.296
and we'll figure this thing
out from the other side.

663
01:02:55.336 --> 01:02:56.616
This may be Clu's game here,

664
01:02:56.656 --> 01:02:58.776
but in my world, he's
gone in one keystroke.

665
01:02:58.856 --> 01:03:02.176
But I can't do anything
unless I get to the portal.

666
01:03:03.536 --> 01:03:04.616
And my guts tell me

667
01:03:04.696 --> 01:03:08.776
that you don't want to be stuck
in this place for eternity either.

668
01:03:10.976 --> 01:03:14.736
I really think you should
consider your father's wisdom.

669
01:03:15.615 --> 01:03:17.415
I have.

670
01:04:21.014 --> 01:04:22.974
There's someone I once knew,

671
01:04:23.014 --> 01:04:26.214
a program named Zuse who
fought alongside the ISOs.

672
01:04:26.254 --> 01:04:29.534
They say he can
get anyone anywhere.

673
01:04:31.254 --> 01:04:33.254
How do I find him?

674
01:04:36.214 --> 01:04:38.054
This is his sector.

675
01:04:41.374 --> 01:04:44.374
Make it there alive,
and he'll find you.

676
01:05:25.093 --> 01:05:26.773
Sam?

677
01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.613
Sam?

678
01:06:03.773 --> 01:06:07.693
<i>All programs are
required to present identity disks</i>

679
01:06:07.813 --> 01:06:09.253
<i>at city checkpoints.</i>

680
01:06:13.572 --> 01:06:16.132
Hey, man.
It's your lucky day.

681
01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.532
<i>Any program
without their disk...</i>

682
01:06:24.652 --> 01:06:26.172
<i>Stop him!</i>

683
01:06:26.252 --> 01:06:28.652
<i>...will be taken
into custody.</i>

684
01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:35.252
<i>Any program in violation of their
function is subject to termination.</i>

685
01:06:35.772 --> 01:06:39.252
Sam
Flynn? You remember me?

686
01:06:39.572 --> 01:06:42.452
Yeah. You gave
me some advice.

687
01:06:42.492 --> 01:06:44.012
And you followed it.

688
01:06:45.012 --> 01:06:47.692
It's unfortunate
we met the way we did.

689
01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:50.332
You have a good night.

690
01:06:50.372 --> 01:06:52.932
You're looking for someone.

691
01:06:55.532 --> 01:06:57.532
What makes you say that?

692
01:06:58.412 --> 01:07:00.412
Intuition.

693
01:07:02.412 --> 01:07:06.692
Sir, the sentries downtown
have recovered Flynn's light cycle.

694
01:07:07.972 --> 01:07:11.331
We've traced it to
its point of origin.

695
01:07:36.211 --> 01:07:39.171
Prepare the
light runner, Quorra.

696
01:07:39.851 --> 01:07:42.411
We're going downtown.

697
01:08:04.731 --> 01:08:06.531
Thank you for bringing
my son to me.

698
01:08:06.571 --> 01:08:07.891
Flynn!

699
01:08:07.931 --> 01:08:10.930
You don't need to go. I've sent
him to someone we can trust.

700
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:13.090
Quorra, there is no choice.

701
01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:16.170
I won't lose him again.

702
01:08:18.130 --> 01:08:21.370
Chaos. Good news.

703
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:05.370
Relax. They're occupied.

704
01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:13.329
His name is Castor.

705
01:09:13.409 --> 01:09:15.769
If you want to speak to Zuse,
you need to go through him.

706
01:09:15.809 --> 01:09:18.489
Where's your
sense of humor, my friend?

707
01:09:18.569 --> 01:09:21.889
Programs are disappearing.
Soon none of us will be left.

708
01:09:22.009 --> 01:09:24.689
Zuse can unite the factions,
foment revolution.

709
01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:26.449
Of course Zuse
can do these things.

710
01:09:26.569 --> 01:09:28.249
Grant me an audience.

711
01:09:28.329 --> 01:09:31.529
Your enthusiasm is
intoxicating, my dear Bartik,

712
01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:34.329
but Zuse's time is precious.

713
01:09:34.409 --> 01:09:36.769
We shall see.

714
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:40.489
I brought your boy Flynn.

715
01:09:40.569 --> 01:09:42.129
If you'll excuse me
for a moment,

716
01:09:42.169 --> 01:09:45.649
I have to attend to something.

717
01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:48.969
But have a drink, courtesy
of the End of Line Club!

718
01:09:49.689 --> 01:09:50.929
It is happening.

719
01:09:51.009 --> 01:09:54.169
Come, away from these
primitive functions.

720
01:09:55.409 --> 01:09:57.729
The son of Flynn.

721
01:09:57.809 --> 01:10:02.769
Of all the innumerable
possibilities, he has to walk into mine.

722
01:10:03.689 --> 01:10:05.209
Libations

723
01:10:05.249 --> 01:10:08.128
for everybody!

724
01:10:10.688 --> 01:10:14.248
I'm Castor, your host.

725
01:10:14.328 --> 01:10:16.888
Provider of any
and all entertainments

726
01:10:16.968 --> 01:10:19.528
and diversions.

727
01:10:19.608 --> 01:10:20.968
At your service.

728
01:10:23.448 --> 01:10:25.888
I'm looking for Zuse.

729
01:10:25.968 --> 01:10:28.888
Indeed. Many are.

730
01:10:28.928 --> 01:10:30.888
Where can I find him?

731
01:10:30.968 --> 01:10:34.968
This, pretty miss, is a conversation
best had behind closed doors.

732
01:10:35.048 --> 01:10:38.568
Perhaps we should retire
to my private lounge.

733
01:10:41.248 --> 01:10:44.568
I designed it myself,
you know. It's true.

734
01:10:44.648 --> 01:10:46.768
I'm stepping away
for a moment, boys.

735
01:10:46.888 --> 01:10:49.088
Change the scheme,
alter the mood.

736
01:10:49.168 --> 01:10:53.968
Electrify the boys and
girls if you'd be so kind.

737
01:10:56.488 --> 01:10:57.928
Thank you.

738
01:10:58.008 --> 01:11:00.848
Gem. My name is Gem.

739
01:11:42.287 --> 01:11:44.047
Cozy.

740
01:13:04.645 --> 01:13:06.365
You are Clu.

741
01:13:06.445 --> 01:13:07.445
I am Clu.

742
01:13:07.525 --> 01:13:09.885
You will create
the perfect system.

743
01:13:10.005 --> 01:13:12.325
I will create
the perfect system.

744
01:13:15.845 --> 01:13:18.885
Together we're gonna
change the world, man.

745
01:13:46.325 --> 01:13:47.405
Let's move.

746
01:13:49.405 --> 01:13:51.045
Zuse has been around

747
01:13:51.085 --> 01:13:53.085
since the earliest days
of the gaming grid.

748
01:13:53.525 --> 01:13:57.645
By necessity, he has to
mind all the percentages.

749
01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.645
All the angles.

750
01:13:59.725 --> 01:14:01.605
So when do I meet him?

751
01:14:04.164 --> 01:14:07.604
You just did.

752
01:14:10.924 --> 01:14:14.844
After the Purge, I
needed to reinvent myself.

753
01:14:14.964 --> 01:14:17.204
Self-preservation,
you understand.

754
01:14:22.244 --> 01:14:26.844
Now, what can I do for you?

755
01:14:29.604 --> 01:14:31.644
I need to get to the portal.

756
01:14:31.684 --> 01:14:33.164
Well, it's closing quickly,

757
01:14:33.244 --> 01:14:35.924
as I'm sure you're aware.

758
01:14:35.964 --> 01:14:37.524
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

759
01:14:37.604 --> 01:14:39.844
And it's quite the journey.

760
01:14:39.924 --> 01:14:42.724
Beyond the far reaches
of the Outlands.

761
01:14:42.804 --> 01:14:44.964
Your father didn't
want any programs

762
01:14:45.124 --> 01:14:47.324
slipping out
accidentally, did he?

763
01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.884
Can you help me?

764
01:14:51.044 --> 01:14:53.284
Of course.

765
01:14:53.324 --> 01:14:57.084
But first, as a man who prides
himself on staying well informed,

766
01:14:57.164 --> 01:14:59.644
I must ask who sent you my way.

767
01:15:02.603 --> 01:15:04.843
Her name's Quorra.

768
01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:07.003
Said she met you
a long time ago.

769
01:15:07.763 --> 01:15:10.163
Indeed she did.

770
01:15:10.203 --> 01:15:12.003
Many cycles ago.

771
01:15:13.003 --> 01:15:15.763
It was a different time.

772
01:15:15.843 --> 01:15:17.683
But we're not here
to relive the past.

773
01:15:17.843 --> 01:15:19.723
Let's see about
your future, shall we?

774
01:15:19.803 --> 01:15:22.443
We'll have to change your attire

775
01:15:22.523 --> 01:15:25.803
and you'll need a forged
disk. Not easy these days.

776
01:15:25.843 --> 01:15:27.643
And of course
you'll need transport

777
01:15:28.683 --> 01:15:31.683
to cross the Sea of Simulation.

778
01:15:42.883 --> 01:15:45.483
This is going to
be quite the ride.

779
01:15:58.003 --> 01:15:59.803
I believed in users once before.

780
01:16:01.642 --> 01:16:03.402
Playing all the angles.

781
01:16:07.882 --> 01:16:09.202
Resist!

782
01:16:18.002 --> 01:16:21.722
The game has changed,
son of Flynn!

783
01:16:38.042 --> 01:16:40.522
I met your friend.
He's fantastic!

784
01:16:40.602 --> 01:16:44.002
Behold!
The son of our maker!

785
01:16:57.762 --> 01:16:59.201
Yeah!

786
01:17:09.081 --> 01:17:10.441
Yeah, yeah!

787
01:17:12.281 --> 01:17:13.561
Yeah, yeah!

788
01:17:49.961 --> 01:17:51.561
Go, go!

789
01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:59.040
Let's split, man.

790
01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

791
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.040
A little help here maybe?

792
01:19:02.359 --> 01:19:03.639
Your disk.

793
01:19:04.599 --> 01:19:05.719
Dad, it's gone.

794
01:19:06.759 --> 01:19:08.039
It is.

795
01:19:10.759 --> 01:19:12.439
I'm sorry.
I know I messed up.

796
01:19:14.599 --> 01:19:15.639
We can go back.

797
01:19:15.759 --> 01:19:16.759
I can go back.

798
01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:18.439
No, we stay together.

799
01:19:18.519 --> 01:19:19.839
Dad, I can do this.

800
01:19:19.919 --> 01:19:21.359
You've done enough already!

801
01:19:26.879 --> 01:19:28.919
Sam, you're really...

802
01:19:31.599 --> 01:19:33.879
You're messing with
my Zen thing, man.

803
01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:37.799
She's stable.

804
01:19:38.919 --> 01:19:40.319
So what
do we do now?

805
01:19:40.399 --> 01:19:42.279
I don't know.
Nothing.

806
01:19:43.239 --> 01:19:45.199
We do nothing.

807
01:19:45.759 --> 01:19:47.279
Be still.

808
01:19:49.919 --> 01:19:51.519
Wait.

809
01:19:59.278 --> 01:20:02.118
You ever jump a freight train?

810
01:20:03.278 --> 01:20:04.318
Huh?

811
01:20:04.398 --> 01:20:07.638
We do it your way.
Full-on sprint to the portal.

812
01:20:07.678 --> 01:20:09.598
If we beat Clu there,
we have a chance.

813
01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:10.958
Let's get her out of here.

814
01:20:29.918 --> 01:20:31.638
This'll take us there.

815
01:20:58.557 --> 01:20:59.717
Is she gonna make it?

816
01:20:59.837 --> 01:21:01.037
I don't know.

817
01:21:01.117 --> 01:21:03.797
I've got to identify
the damaged code.

818
01:21:03.837 --> 01:21:07.437
The sequencing is just
enormously complex.

819
01:21:08.517 --> 01:21:10.597
But didn't
you write it?

820
01:21:10.677 --> 01:21:13.237
Some of it.
The rest of it is just

821
01:21:16.077 --> 01:21:18.637
beyond me.

822
01:21:19.877 --> 01:21:22.237
She's an ISO.

823
01:21:22.317 --> 01:21:24.757
Yeah.
The last ISO.

824
01:21:27.037 --> 01:21:28.437
All this time,

825
01:21:28.557 --> 01:21:30.877
you were just protecting her.

826
01:21:30.957 --> 01:21:34.997
She's the miracle, man.
Everything I ever worked for.

827
01:21:36.397 --> 01:21:40.637
"A digital frontier to reshape
the human condition."

828
01:21:40.717 --> 01:21:43.917
I always thought
that was just a plug line.

829
01:21:43.997 --> 01:21:48.237
In our world,
she could change everything.

830
01:21:49.637 --> 01:21:51.757
Yeah.

831
01:21:53.556 --> 01:21:55.996
Check that out.

832
01:22:04.116 --> 01:22:06.236
She risked herself for me.

833
01:22:08.196 --> 01:22:10.556
Some things are worth the risk.

834
01:22:24.076 --> 01:22:26.036
Look at this.

835
01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:32.516
Now, that is impressive
if I do say so myself. Huh?

836
01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:37.156
Come on, it's gonna take a
while for her system to reboot.

837
01:22:37.236 --> 01:22:40.436
Now it's time for you
to tell me a story.

838
01:22:58.595 --> 01:23:00.875
The boy
and Flynn are gone.

839
01:23:00.955 --> 01:23:04.795
I presume, Your
Excellency, they perished in the elevator.

840
01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:09.795
You presume?

841
01:23:11.955 --> 01:23:14.155
Find them.

842
01:23:18.475 --> 01:23:21.835
Icecaps are melting,
war in the Middle East,

843
01:23:21.915 --> 01:23:24.075
Lakers/Celtics back at it.

844
01:23:25.195 --> 01:23:28.395
I don't know. Rich are getting
richer, poor are getting poorer.

845
01:23:28.475 --> 01:23:31.195
Cell phones,
online dating, Wi-Fi.

846
01:23:31.275 --> 01:23:32.755
What's Wi-Fi?

847
01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:34.355
Wireless interlinking.

848
01:23:34.475 --> 01:23:35.835
Of digital devices?

849
01:23:35.955 --> 01:23:37.315
Yeah.

850
01:23:37.555 --> 01:23:40.835
Hmm. I thought
of that in '85.

851
01:23:45.475 --> 01:23:47.595
Mom and Dad are...

852
01:23:49.355 --> 01:23:50.715
I assume that...

853
01:23:50.795 --> 01:23:51.834
Yeah.

854
01:23:52.714 --> 01:23:53.794
Oh.

855
01:23:54.834 --> 01:23:57.194
Mac when I was 12

856
01:23:57.274 --> 01:24:00.194
and Gram five years later.

857
01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:06.874
You remember that night
when you didn't come home?

858
01:24:06.914 --> 01:24:08.154
Well...
You said...

859
01:24:08.194 --> 01:24:10.314
I said I'd show you the Grid.

860
01:24:12.354 --> 01:24:14.714
You should have seen
this place back then.

861
01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:20.954
I couldn't wait to show
it to you. Could not wait.

862
01:24:21.034 --> 01:24:23.554
Must have been
something before Clu screwed it up.

863
01:24:23.634 --> 01:24:25.394
No, no, he...

864
01:24:27.114 --> 01:24:29.834
He's me.
I screwed it up.

865
01:24:31.314 --> 01:24:33.434
Chasing after perfection.

866
01:24:35.514 --> 01:24:39.234
Chasing after what was
right in front of me.

867
01:24:39.754 --> 01:24:41.714
Right in front of me.

868
01:24:43.554 --> 01:24:45.954
Look what you've accomplished.

869
01:24:46.314 --> 01:24:48.114
It's incredible.

870
01:24:48.194 --> 01:24:49.554
Sam,

871
01:24:50.513 --> 01:24:53.833
I'd have given it all up
for one more day with you.

872
01:25:06.913 --> 01:25:07.953
Hey.

873
01:25:08.593 --> 01:25:10.753
Remember your old Ducati?

874
01:25:10.913 --> 01:25:11.953
You kidding?

875
01:25:12.033 --> 01:25:14.193
Not a day goes by I
don't think about that bike.

876
01:25:14.273 --> 01:25:16.153
Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.

877
01:25:16.913 --> 01:25:18.233
You busted my bike?

878
01:25:18.273 --> 01:25:20.553
Twenty years in
the shed, no tarp.

879
01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:23.993
I mean, she
needed a little love.

880
01:25:25.593 --> 01:25:27.153
How does she run?

881
01:25:27.233 --> 01:25:31.233
Well, when I'm done,
better than ever.

882
01:25:32.433 --> 01:25:34.993
Well, man, I'd like to see that.

883
01:25:36.633 --> 01:25:38.153
You will.

884
01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:42.633
Here.

885
01:25:42.913 --> 01:25:45.353
She's rebooting.
Give her this.

886
01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:49.272
The old man's gonna knock
on the sky, listen to the sound.

887
01:26:15.592 --> 01:26:17.152
When Flynn
entered the space,

888
01:26:17.592 --> 01:26:20.752
ah, everything changed.

889
01:26:21.272 --> 01:26:23.872
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

890
01:26:24.472 --> 01:26:26.952
The awe was

891
01:26:27.832 --> 01:26:29.272
palpable.

892
01:26:30.832 --> 01:26:31.872
Was it?

893
01:26:31.992 --> 01:26:33.072
I presume

894
01:26:33.712 --> 01:26:36.912
our understanding
is still valid?

895
01:26:38.472 --> 01:26:40.592
Control of the city?

896
01:26:41.192 --> 01:26:44.192
A size able request, I know.

897
01:26:44.232 --> 01:26:47.112
But seemingly
fitting compensation.

898
01:26:47.711 --> 01:26:49.151
Don't you think?

899
01:26:50.511 --> 01:26:54.071
How long have you been
searching for this, Clu?

900
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:57.831
About 1,000 cycles. No?

901
01:26:58.631 --> 01:27:01.711
Just imagine
the secrets it holds.

902
01:27:04.671 --> 01:27:07.591
The master key to
any and all riddles

903
01:27:08.231 --> 01:27:10.751
of the Grid, Grid, Grid, Grid...

904
01:27:13.631 --> 01:27:15.431
But there's something else, too.

905
01:27:15.991 --> 01:27:17.191
Isn't there?

906
01:27:17.231 --> 01:27:19.111
I've heard the chatter

907
01:27:19.231 --> 01:27:22.591
about this private initiative.

908
01:27:32.111 --> 01:27:35.191
I realize that our alliance is,

909
01:27:35.231 --> 01:27:36.711
at times,

910
01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:38.231
uneasy.

911
01:27:38.311 --> 01:27:40.311
But always necessary.

912
01:27:42.071 --> 01:27:44.071
You know you need me

913
01:27:44.151 --> 01:27:45.871
right where I am.

914
01:27:45.911 --> 01:27:47.430
Clu?

915
01:27:47.950 --> 01:27:50.190
Of course you're right.

916
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:52.750
Enjoy the drink.

917
01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:02.510
End of line, man.

918
01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:15.230
Hey. It's okay.
We're safe for now.

919
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:17.950
We're heading east
towards the portal.

920
01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:22.550
Clu has the disk.

921
01:28:23.150 --> 01:28:26.070
Once I get out,
I can shut him down.

922
01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:31.750
I should never have sent
you to Zuse. It was a mistake.

923
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:34.310
It's okay. I've
made a few myself.

924
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:41.430
Where is he?

925
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:45.229
I think he's
knocking on the sky.

926
01:28:45.349 --> 01:28:47.469
And
listening to the sound.

927
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:50.149
Yeah.

928
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:52.709
How did you find him?

929
01:29:02.189 --> 01:29:03.309
It's okay.

930
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:07.509
I know.

931
01:29:12.789 --> 01:29:15.109
It was during the Purge.

932
01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:18.229
Clu was relentless.

933
01:29:18.589 --> 01:29:21.949
The Black Guard were
executing ISOs in the streets.

934
01:29:23.109 --> 01:29:25.829
Everyone I knew disappeared.

935
01:29:28.509 --> 01:29:30.549
Then they came for me.

936
01:29:33.309 --> 01:29:35.229
So I ran.

937
01:29:36.309 --> 01:29:39.589
A sympathetic program
smuggled me out of the city.

938
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:42.189
But soon they had me surrounded.

939
01:29:42.269 --> 01:29:44.308
I prepared for the end.

940
01:29:44.468 --> 01:29:46.868
And just as everything
was going dark,

941
01:29:47.428 --> 01:29:50.388
I felt a hand on my shoulder.

942
01:29:53.108 --> 01:29:55.188
And when I opened my eyes,

943
01:29:56.628 --> 01:30:01.028
standing above me
was the Creator.

944
01:30:03.668 --> 01:30:05.428
Your father.

945
01:30:07.028 --> 01:30:08.708
He saved me.

946
01:30:12.948 --> 01:30:16.468
I guess you could
say I'm a rescue.

947
01:30:35.548 --> 01:30:37.348
Hell of a view.

948
01:30:37.468 --> 01:30:40.308
It used to let us
know that Flynn was here.

949
01:30:40.388 --> 01:30:42.748
It became the symbol
of something bigger,

950
01:30:42.827 --> 01:30:46.147
something better
than this world.

951
01:30:46.907 --> 01:30:49.387
I've never been
this close before.

952
01:30:50.547 --> 01:30:53.107
It's how I imagine
a sunrise to be.

953
01:30:53.187 --> 01:30:55.507
Ah, trust me.
There's no comparison.

954
01:30:58.947 --> 01:31:00.907
What's it like?

955
01:31:02.947 --> 01:31:04.107
The sun?

956
01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:05.827
Yeah.

957
01:31:06.267 --> 01:31:08.267
Man...

958
01:31:09.827 --> 01:31:12.467
I've never had to
describe it before.

959
01:31:14.467 --> 01:31:15.667
Warm.

960
01:31:17.747 --> 01:31:19.267
Radiant.

961
01:31:22.067 --> 01:31:23.867
Beautiful.

962
01:31:49.466 --> 01:31:52.266
Get below! Move!

963
01:31:54.066 --> 01:31:56.386
This isn't supposed to be here.

964
01:32:00.666 --> 01:32:02.226
What happened?

965
01:32:02.386 --> 01:32:03.986
A new course.

966
01:32:14.866 --> 01:32:16.346
What is this?

967
01:32:17.306 --> 01:32:18.946
Clu can't create programs.

968
01:32:19.226 --> 01:32:21.826
He can only destroy
or repurpose them.

969
01:32:22.786 --> 01:32:25.346
Repurpose them for what?

970
01:32:28.746 --> 01:32:32.626
<i>Battalion 6,
report to Staging Area Alpha.</i>

971
01:32:35.786 --> 01:32:37.346
He's building an army.

972
01:32:38.346 --> 01:32:39.706
Let's go.

973
01:32:39.746 --> 01:32:41.785
<i>All high-level functions,</i>

974
01:32:41.865 --> 01:32:44.705
<i>report immediately
to combat stations.</i>

975
01:33:10.105 --> 01:33:11.185
Goodbye.

976
01:33:11.305 --> 01:33:12.385
Quorra!

977
01:33:12.905 --> 01:33:14.025
What's she doing?

978
01:33:14.065 --> 01:33:15.905
Removing herself
from the equation.

979
01:33:33.985 --> 01:33:35.465
Tron.

980
01:33:37.265 --> 01:33:39.344
He's alive.

981
01:33:39.904 --> 01:33:42.424
<i>Throne ship is approaching.</i>

982
01:33:45.304 --> 01:33:46.624
We can't just let her go.

983
01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:49.264
No, Sam, there's another way.

984
01:33:49.664 --> 01:33:52.104
<i>Throne ship is approaching.</i>

985
01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.464
Well done, sir.

986
01:34:19.664 --> 01:34:22.224
I've never seen
anything like it.

987
01:34:22.624 --> 01:34:26.304
Humbly, sir, I know
you have greater designs

988
01:34:26.384 --> 01:34:28.984
than any of us understand.

989
01:34:30.144 --> 01:34:31.624
What does it do?

990
01:34:57.503 --> 01:34:59.383
She's gonna wind up
like one of them.

991
01:34:59.863 --> 01:35:01.143
Keep moving, Sam.

992
01:35:11.743 --> 01:35:15.543
You are a very rare
bird, aren't you, now?

993
01:35:23.783 --> 01:35:25.543
Where's your disk?

994
01:35:28.103 --> 01:35:29.943
Where is he?

995
01:35:31.863 --> 01:35:34.583
It must have been
so lonely out there.

996
01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:38.462
How tragic to be the only one.

997
01:35:40.382 --> 01:35:43.262
I've seen what users
are capable of, Clu.

998
01:35:44.062 --> 01:35:46.342
You don't belong with them.

999
01:35:51.462 --> 01:35:54.342
I have something very
special in mind for you.

1000
01:35:57.902 --> 01:35:59.462
Take her upstairs.

1001
01:35:59.902 --> 01:36:01.662
And find them.

1002
01:36:02.342 --> 01:36:07.142
You'll have to excuse me. You arrived
just as I was preparing a little toast.

1003
01:36:22.222 --> 01:36:24.182
Greetings, programs!

1004
01:36:28.102 --> 01:36:32.062
Together we have achieved
a great many things.

1005
01:36:32.262 --> 01:36:36.261
We have created a vast, complex
system. We've maintained it.

1006
01:36:37.581 --> 01:36:40.061
We've improved it.

1007
01:36:40.101 --> 01:36:44.061
We have rid it
of its imperfection.

1008
01:36:45.621 --> 01:36:47.101
Not to mention

1009
01:36:47.221 --> 01:36:50.501
rid it of the false deity
who sought to enslave us.

1010
01:36:52.861 --> 01:36:55.061
Kevin Flynn!

1011
01:36:56.101 --> 01:36:57.461
Where are you now?

1012
01:37:01.621 --> 01:37:04.821
My fellow programs,
let there be no doubt

1013
01:37:04.901 --> 01:37:07.461
that our world
is a cage no more.

1014
01:37:07.901 --> 01:37:12.541
For at this moment, the key
to the next frontier is finally

1015
01:37:12.781 --> 01:37:14.341
in our possession!

1016
01:37:19.861 --> 01:37:21.821
Your disk.

1017
01:37:21.901 --> 01:37:23.661
And unlike
our selfish Creator,

1018
01:37:23.701 --> 01:37:27.421
who reserved the privilege
of our world only for himself,

1019
01:37:27.501 --> 01:37:31.141
I will make their world open

1020
01:37:31.261 --> 01:37:33.501
and available to all of us!

1021
01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:38.100
Yes!

1022
01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:40.300
To all of us!

1023
01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:52.420
He's taking
all of this with him.

1024
01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:54.860
He's figured out how to do it.

1025
01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.860
And whatever
we find there,

1026
01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:59.100
there our system will grow!

1027
01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:02.780
There our system will blossom!

1028
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:05.500
Do this.

1029
01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:08.260
Prove yourselves.
Prove yourselves to me!

1030
01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.940
Be loyal to me!

1031
01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:13.300
And I will never betray you!

1032
01:38:25.860 --> 01:38:27.500
Dad, we have to get your disk.

1033
01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:30.380
We gotta get to the portal.
You shut them down outside.

1034
01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:33.180
Even if I make it, you won't
last in here, nor will Quorra.

1035
01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.579
We'll be all right.
Come on.

1036
01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:36.539
I'm not going home without you.

1037
01:38:37.579 --> 01:38:38.899
Sam...

1038
01:38:39.419 --> 01:38:41.219
The same team.

1039
01:38:42.139 --> 01:38:43.539
Remember?

1040
01:38:45.699 --> 01:38:47.739
I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

1041
01:38:48.739 --> 01:38:50.915
Meet me on the flight deck in
five and get us some wheels.

1042
01:38:50.939 --> 01:38:53.139
Wheels?
What's your plan?

1043
01:38:53.979 --> 01:38:56.379
I'm a user.
I'll improvise.

1044
01:38:57.979 --> 01:38:59.939
Maximize efficiency.

1045
01:39:01.379 --> 01:39:04.259
Rid the new system
of its imperfection!

1046
01:39:06.819 --> 01:39:10.419
My vision is clear,
fellow programs.

1047
01:39:11.339 --> 01:39:15.499
Out there is a new world!

1048
01:39:16.259 --> 01:39:18.939
Out there is our victory!

1049
01:39:20.379 --> 01:39:21.939
Out there

1050
01:39:23.979 --> 01:39:26.499
is our destiny.

1051
01:40:10.138 --> 01:40:12.818
<i>Identify
yourself, program.</i>

1052
01:40:15.978 --> 01:40:19.098
I'm not a program.
My name is Sam Flynn.

1053
01:40:43.057 --> 01:40:44.137
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

1054
01:40:44.177 --> 01:40:45.537
I'm taking this vehicle.

1055
01:40:45.617 --> 01:40:47.497
<i>You are not authorized.</i>

1056
01:40:49.857 --> 01:40:52.257
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

1057
01:40:53.217 --> 01:40:56.657
<i>Watch your step, please,
as you board the aircraft.</i>

1058
01:41:07.857 --> 01:41:10.137
Long live the users.

1059
01:41:16.857 --> 01:41:19.697
<i>Master key disengaged.</i>

1060
01:41:19.977 --> 01:41:22.377
<i>Master key disengaged.</i>

1061
01:41:22.577 --> 01:41:26.697
I came with a girl, a
program. Where is she?

1062
01:41:29.217 --> 01:41:30.936
Sam! Go!

1063
01:41:57.176 --> 01:41:58.256
Why are you here?

1064
01:41:58.416 --> 01:41:59.552
We gotta get to the flight deck.

1065
01:41:59.576 --> 01:42:00.935
Clu will be here any minute.

1066
01:42:00.936 --> 01:42:02.856
We'll never make it.
Come on.

1067
01:42:09.216 --> 01:42:10.576
Come on, kiddo.

1068
01:42:14.176 --> 01:42:16.936
Radical, man.

1069
01:42:24.696 --> 01:42:26.176
Hurry!

1070
01:42:26.296 --> 01:42:27.936
Made it.

1071
01:42:46.695 --> 01:42:49.815
Try and hold on to this.
You're gonna need it.

1072
01:42:54.815 --> 01:42:58.455
You got this, Quorra.
It's all in the wrist.

1073
01:43:13.335 --> 01:43:16.895
<i>Light fighter
5. Unauthorized launch.</i>

1074
01:43:37.974 --> 01:43:40.014
Death to the user!

1075
01:44:04.414 --> 01:44:05.694
Head towards the light, Quorra.

1076
01:44:08.534 --> 01:44:10.374
Where did you learn that move?

1077
01:44:10.494 --> 01:44:13.134
ENCOM Tower.
Couple of nights ago.

1078
01:44:15.574 --> 01:44:18.254
ENCOM Tower. Huh.

1079
01:44:20.054 --> 01:44:21.254
Light jets.

1080
01:44:21.854 --> 01:44:23.214
Here they come.

1081
01:44:24.134 --> 01:44:25.414
Sam, take the turret.

1082
01:44:25.734 --> 01:44:26.893
Huh?

1083
01:44:34.773 --> 01:44:37.093
Man, I'm all over this.

1084
01:44:40.053 --> 01:44:41.253
Yeah!

1085
01:44:51.093 --> 01:44:54.413
Yeah! One down,
five to go!

1086
01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:01.133
Nice.

1087
01:45:10.613 --> 01:45:12.533
We gotta split them up!

1088
01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:33.652
Come on.

1089
01:45:37.852 --> 01:45:38.892
Have a nice swim!

1090
01:45:46.052 --> 01:45:48.132
We gotta get
behind them!

1091
01:45:48.732 --> 01:45:50.612
Whoo!

1092
01:45:55.932 --> 01:45:57.492
I don't think
this is a good idea.

1093
01:45:57.612 --> 01:45:59.172
You're probably right.

1094
01:46:04.892 --> 01:46:06.372
He's gaining on us!

1095
01:46:37.171 --> 01:46:38.571
Yes!

1096
01:46:50.091 --> 01:46:51.171
It's jammed.

1097
01:46:56.691 --> 01:47:00.051
Tron. What have you become?

1098
01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:06.371
Oh, come on.

1099
01:47:09.571 --> 01:47:12.091
<i>Flynn, go!</i>

1100
01:47:15.571 --> 01:47:17.771
<i>Rinzler!
Take the shot!</i>

1101
01:47:20.651 --> 01:47:22.411
<i>Finish the game!</i>

1102
01:47:30.250 --> 01:47:32.210
Roll!

1103
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:47.290
<i>I fight for the users.</i>

1104
01:47:57.250 --> 01:47:59.770
That's it.
It's over.

1105
01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:01.770
It's over!

1106
01:48:03.850 --> 01:48:05.690
Whoo!

1107
01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:16.330
Quorra, there's
something I need you to do.

1108
01:49:05.009 --> 01:49:06.969
Let's get you home, Dad.

1109
01:49:11.009 --> 01:49:12.329
There it is.

1110
01:49:12.929 --> 01:49:14.609
Take her down.

1111
01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:17.009
Hang on.
This could be rough.

1112
01:50:09.368 --> 01:50:11.568
This is mine.

1113
01:50:16.728 --> 01:50:18.888
I had a feeling you'd be here!

1114
01:50:19.008 --> 01:50:22.847
The cycles
haven't been kind, have they?

1115
01:50:23.727 --> 01:50:26.047
Oh, you don't look so bad.

1116
01:50:27.287 --> 01:50:30.927
I did everything.
Everything you ever asked.

1117
01:50:31.447 --> 01:50:33.247
I know you did.

1118
01:50:33.287 --> 01:50:34.927
I executed the plan!

1119
01:50:35.567 --> 01:50:36.687
As you saw it.

1120
01:50:36.767 --> 01:50:41.927
You... You promised that we
would change the world together.

1121
01:50:42.287 --> 01:50:44.487
You broke your promise. I know.

1122
01:50:44.727 --> 01:50:46.087
I understand that now.

1123
01:50:46.167 --> 01:50:49.647
I took this system
to its maximum potential.

1124
01:50:49.727 --> 01:50:51.887
I created the perfect system!

1125
01:50:51.927 --> 01:50:55.727
The thing about perfection
is that it's unknowable.

1126
01:50:56.847 --> 01:51:01.487
It's impossible but it's also
right in front of us all the time.

1127
01:51:01.607 --> 01:51:05.287
You wouldn't know that because
I didn't when I created you.

1128
01:51:07.047 --> 01:51:08.767
I'm sorry, Clu.

1129
01:51:10.927 --> 01:51:13.327
I'm sorry.

1130
01:51:35.006 --> 01:51:36.286
Go.

1131
01:51:49.646 --> 01:51:50.846
Clu!

1132
01:51:51.726 --> 01:51:54.046
Remember what you came for.

1133
01:52:08.006 --> 01:52:09.046
Dad!

1134
01:52:09.166 --> 01:52:10.686
You knew
I'd beat you.

1135
01:52:10.806 --> 01:52:13.846
And still you did
all this? For him.

1136
01:52:20.045 --> 01:52:21.285
No.

1137
01:52:26.845 --> 01:52:28.165
No!

1138
01:52:28.205 --> 01:52:29.565
Why?

1139
01:52:31.245 --> 01:52:32.645
He's my son.

1140
01:52:39.005 --> 01:52:40.045
Go!

1141
01:52:45.885 --> 01:52:46.965
Dad!

1142
01:52:53.525 --> 01:52:55.685
Sam! It's time!

1143
01:52:55.885 --> 01:52:57.045
No!

1144
01:52:57.445 --> 01:53:00.245
Sam, it's what he wants.

1145
01:53:02.245 --> 01:53:04.205
I'm not leaving you!

1146
01:53:04.565 --> 01:53:06.085
Take her!

1147
01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:19.124
Yes!

1148
01:53:46.764 --> 01:53:48.484
Goodbye, kiddo.

1149
01:54:19.803 --> 01:54:21.683
No!

1150
01:55:32.602 --> 01:55:34.442
Al?

1151
01:55:38.842 --> 01:55:40.682
You paged me?

1152
01:55:41.162 --> 01:55:42.842
Yeah.

1153
01:55:43.602 --> 01:55:45.882
I need you at ENCOM
at 8:00 a.m.

1154
01:55:47.842 --> 01:55:49.402
What about the board?

1155
01:55:51.002 --> 01:55:52.922
You're chairman now.

1156
01:55:55.242 --> 01:55:57.722
I'm taking
the company back, Alan.

1157
01:56:01.802 --> 01:56:03.042
Oh, and...

1158
01:56:04.282 --> 01:56:05.962
You were right.

1159
01:56:07.642 --> 01:56:09.082
About what?

1160
01:56:10.722 --> 01:56:12.282
About everything.

1161
01:56:37.161 --> 01:56:38.441
What's next, Sam?

1162
01:56:44.241 --> 01:56:47.641
I guess we're supposed
to change the world.

1163
01:56:51.681 --> 01:56:54.441
Come on. I wanna
show you something.
