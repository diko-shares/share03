1
00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:52.416
We're here.

2
00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:17.916
- Hello?

3
00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:20.832
Who's there?

4
00:04:58.874 --> 00:05:03.291
- You scared me to death,
you mangy thing!

5
00:05:03.457 --> 00:05:05.791
I'm just lookin' for an old well.

6
00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:07.082
Know it?

7
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:11.416
Not talkin', huh?

8
00:05:13.374 --> 00:05:16.124
Magic dowser, magic dowser.

9
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:19.999
Show me the well!

10
00:05:29.332 --> 00:05:31.374
Get away from me!

11
00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.207
- Ooh, let me guess.
You're from Texas or Utah.

12
00:05:45.374 --> 00:05:46.791
Someplace dried out and barren, right?

13
00:05:46.957 --> 00:05:48.999
I heard about water-witching before.

14
00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:50.624
But it doesn't make sense.

15
00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.541
I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.

16
00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:54.332
- It's a dowsing rod!

17
00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:55.666
- Ow!

18
00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:57.291
- And I don't like
being stalked!

19
00:05:57.457 --> 00:06:00.207
Not by psycho nerds or their cats!

20
00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:02.374
- He's not really my cat.
He's kind of feral.

21
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:03.791
You know, wild?

22
00:06:03.957 --> 00:06:05.874
Of course, I do feed him every night.

23
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:07.624
And sometimes he'll come to my window

24
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.707
and bring me little dead things.

25
00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:12.374
- Look, I'm from Pontiac.

26
00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.999
- Huh?
- Michigan?

27
00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:19.374
And if I'm a water witch,
then where's the secret well?

28
00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:22.166
- You stomp too hard,
and you'll fall in it.

29
00:06:22.332 --> 00:06:23.791
- Oh!

30
00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:28.416
See?

31
00:06:28.582 --> 00:06:29.832
<i>It's supposed to be so deep,</i>

32
00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:31.707
if you fell to the bottom and looked up,

33
00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:34.957
you'd see a sky full of stars
in the middle of the day.

34
00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:37.707
- Huh.

35
00:06:37.874 --> 00:06:39.874
- Surprised
she let you move in.

36
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.624
My grandma? She owns the Pink Palace.

37
00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:44.249
Won't rent to people with kids.

38
00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:45.832
- What do you mean?

39
00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:48.707
- Oh, I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

40
00:06:48.874 --> 00:06:51.457
I'm Wybie. Wybie Lovat.

41
00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:53.582
- "Wybie"?
- Short for "Wyborne."

42
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:55.791
<i>Not my idea, of course.</i>

43
00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.499
What'd you get saddled with?

44
00:06:57.666 --> 00:06:58.957
- I wasn't "saddled”
with anything.

45
00:06:59.124 --> 00:07:01.832
It's Coraline.
- Caroline what?

46
00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:03.957
- Coraline.
Coraline Jones.

47
00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:06.124
- Hmm.
It's not real scientific,

48
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:08.374
but I heard an ordinary name like Caroline

49
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:10.832
can lead people to have ordinary
expectations about a person.

50
00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:14.207
<i>Wyborne?</i>

51
00:07:14.374 --> 00:07:17.124
- I think I heard someone
calling you, Wyborne.

52
00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:20.499
- What?
I didn't hear anything.

53
00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:24.332
- Oh, I definitely heard
someone, "Why-were-you-borne."

54
00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:26.457
Wyborne!

55
00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:27.874
- Grandma!

56
00:07:31.374 --> 00:07:34.291
- Well, great to meet
a Michigan water witch.

57
00:07:35.624 --> 00:07:38.332
But I'd wear gloves next time.

58
00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:40.207
- Why?

59
00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:43.666
- 'Cause that dowsing rod
of yours, it's poison oak.

60
00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:18.082
- I almost fell down
a well yesterday, Mom.

61
00:08:18.249 --> 00:08:19.332
- Uh-huh.

62
00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:21.707
- I would have died.

63
00:08:21.874 --> 00:08:23.582
- That's nice.

64
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:26.499
- Hmm.
So can I go out?

65
00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:28.749
I think it's perfect weather
for gardening.

66
00:08:28.916 --> 00:08:30.916
- No, Coraline.
Rain makes mud.

67
00:08:31.082 --> 00:08:32.707
Mud makes a mess.

68
00:08:32.874 --> 00:08:36.041
- Mom, I want stuff growing
when my friends come to visit.

69
00:08:36.207 --> 00:08:37.749
Isn't that why we moved here?

70
00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:39.624
- Something like that.

71
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.957
But then we had the accident.

72
00:08:42.124 --> 00:08:43.957
- It wasn't my fault
you hit that truck!

73
00:08:44.124 --> 00:08:45.207
- I never said it was.

74
00:08:45.374 --> 00:08:46.791
- I can't believe it.

75
00:08:46.957 --> 00:08:48.957
You and Dad get paid to write about plants

76
00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:50.457
and you hate dirt.

77
00:08:50.624 --> 00:08:53.249
- Coraline, I don't have
time for you right now.

78
00:08:53.416 --> 00:08:54.832
And you still have unpacking to do.

79
00:08:54.999 --> 00:08:56.957
Lots of unpacking!

80
00:08:57.124 --> 00:09:00.082
- That sounds exciting.

81
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:04.957
- Oh, some kid left this
on the front porch.

82
00:09:05.124 --> 00:09:06.582
<i>"Hey, Jonesy.</i>

83
00:09:06.749 --> 00:09:08.332
<i>Look what I found in Grandma's trunk.</i>

84
00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:10.791
<i>Look familiar? Wybie."</i>

85
00:09:13.791 --> 00:09:14.832
<i>- Huh.</i>

86
00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:19.041
A little me? That's weird.

87
00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:20.832
- What's his name anyway?

88
00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:24.624
- Wybie. I'm way too old
for dolls.

89
00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:31.291
Hey, Dad. How's the writing going?

90
00:09:34.957 --> 00:09:36.791
Dad!

91
00:09:36.957 --> 00:09:38.166
- Hello, Coraline.

92
00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:41.541
And Coraline... doll?

93
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:44.749
- Do you know where
the garden tools are?

94
00:09:44.916 --> 00:09:48.499
- It's pouring
out there, isn't it?

95
00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:51.291
- Hmm.
It's just raining.

96
00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:53.291
- Hmm, what'd
"the boss" say?

97
00:09:53.457 --> 00:09:56.666
- "Don't even think about
going out, Coraline Jones!"

98
00:09:56.832 --> 00:09:58.624
- Then you won't need
the tools.

99
00:09:58.791 --> 00:10:00.416
- Oh...

100
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:10.499
- Oh!

101
00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:14.124
You know, this house is 150 years old.

102
00:10:14.291 --> 00:10:17.124
-So?
- So explore it.

103
00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:19.957
Go out and count all the doors and windows

104
00:10:20.124 --> 00:10:22.832
and write that down,
or list everything that's blue.

105
00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:25.332
Just let me work!

106
00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:03.332
- Ugh!

107
00:11:03.499 --> 00:11:05.541
Agh!

108
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:08.957
Oh, ugh!

109
00:11:13.416 --> 00:11:15.041
Ah!

110
00:11:34.832 --> 00:11:37.749
- No.
No, no! No!

111
00:12:15.291 --> 00:12:17.916
- One boring blue boy

112
00:12:18.082 --> 00:12:21.499
in a painfully boring painting.

113
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:26.791
Four incredibly boring windows.

114
00:12:26.957 --> 00:12:30.624
And no more doors.

115
00:12:33.457 --> 00:12:36.832
All right, little me.
Where are you hiding?

116
00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:46.791
Huh?

117
00:12:51.207 --> 00:12:53.624
Hey, Mom! Where does this door go?

118
00:12:53.791 --> 00:12:56.082
- I'm really, really busy!

119
00:12:56.249 --> 00:12:57.957
- I think it's locked!

120
00:12:59.624 --> 00:13:02.666
<i>Please?</i>

121
00:13:10.332 --> 00:13:14.082
- Will you stop pestering me
if I do this for you?

122
00:13:16.332 --> 00:13:17.999
- Fine!

123
00:13:34.624 --> 00:13:37.082
- Bricks?
I don't get it!

124
00:13:37.249 --> 00:13:38.957
- They must have closed
this off

125
00:13:39.124 --> 00:13:40.624
when they divided up the house.

126
00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:43.541
- You're kidding.
And why is the door so small?

127
00:13:43.707 --> 00:13:46.082
- We made a deal.

128
00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:47.749
Zip it!

129
00:13:49.499 --> 00:13:52.124
You didn't lock it.

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:11.707
- Coraline, we've been
through this before.

136
00:14:11.874 --> 00:14:13.499
Your dad cooks, I clean,

137
00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:15.582
and you stay out of the way.

138
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:19.707

soon as we finish the catalog.

139

Try some of the chard.
You need a vegetable.

140
00:14:22.124 --> 00:14:24.416
- It looks more
like slime to me.

141
00:14:24.582 --> 00:14:27.791
- Well, it's slime

142
00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:29.499
<i>Now what's it gonna be?</i>

143
00:14:29.666 --> 00:14:32.541

Whoa.

147
00:16:30.332 --> 00:16:32.541
Huh?

148
00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:44.416
- Hmm, something
smells good.

149
00:16:54.707 --> 00:16:56.374
- Mom?

152
00:17:04.374 --> 00:17:06.207
- You're not my mother.

153
00:17:06.374 --> 00:17:09.207
My mother doesn't have bu-- but--

154
00:17:09.374 --> 00:17:10.874
- Bu-- b-buttons?

155
00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:13.249
Do you like them?

156
00:17:13.416 --> 00:17:15.541
I'm your Other Mother, silly.

157
00:17:15.707 --> 00:17:18.291
Now go tell your Other Father
that supper's ready.

158
00:17:20.666 --> 00:17:23.707
Well, go on. He's in his study.

Wanna hear my new song?

162
00:17:38.374 --> 00:17:41.332
- My father can't play piano.
- No need to.

163
00:17:43.957 --> 00:17:46.332
This piano plays <i>me.</i>

164
00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:47.749

Ahem.

our mother's golden chicken breast.

181
00:18:52.416 --> 00:18:53.416
- Mmm.

182
00:18:53.582 --> 00:18:54.957
<i>This chicken is good!</i>

183
00:18:55.124 --> 00:18:57.332
- Hungry, aren't you?

184
00:18:57.499 --> 00:18:59.291
- Do you have any gravy?

185
00:18:59.457 --> 00:19:01.291
- Well, here comes
the gravy train.

186
00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:03.124
Choo-choo!

187
00:19:11.207 --> 00:19:12.207
- Huh.

188
00:19:12.374 --> 00:19:14.457
- Another roll?
Sweet peas?

189
00:19:14.624 --> 00:19:16.999
<i>Corn on the cob?</i>

190
00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:18.957
- I'm real thirsty.

191
00:19:19.124 --> 00:19:22.166
- Of course.
Any requests?

192
00:19:22.332 --> 00:19:24.374
- Mango milkshake?

193
00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:39.499
"Home"?

194
00:19:39.666 --> 00:19:42.249
- We've been waiting
for you, Coraline.

195
00:19:42.416 --> 00:19:43.957
- For me?
<i>- Yep.</i>

196
00:19:44.124 --> 00:19:46.291
<i>It wasn't the same here
without you, kiddo.</i>

197
00:19:46.457 --> 00:19:48.082
- I didn't know
I had another mother.

198
00:19:48.249 --> 00:19:51.457
- Of course, you do.
Everyone does.

199
00:19:51.624 --> 00:19:52.957
- Really?
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

200
00:19:53.124 --> 00:19:54.374
And soon as you're through eating,

201
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:56.291
I thought we'd play a game.

202
00:19:59.749 --> 00:20:01.916
- You mean,
like hide and seek?

203
00:20:02.082 --> 00:20:06.166
- Perfect!
Hide and seek in the rain.

204
00:20:06.332 --> 00:20:07.791
- What rain?

205
00:20:07.957 --> 00:20:10.374
Huh!

206
00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.249
What about the mud?

207
00:20:12.416 --> 00:20:13.791
- We love mud here.

208
00:20:13.957 --> 00:20:17.499
- Mud facials, mud baths,
mud pies.

209
00:20:17.666 --> 00:20:19.874
It's great for poison oak.

210
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:21.624
- How'd you know [--?

211
00:20:21.791 --> 00:20:24.124
I'd love to play,

212
00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:27.166
but I'd better get home
to my other mother.

213
00:20:27.332 --> 00:20:28.999
- But <i>I'm</i> your Other Mother.

214
00:20:29.166 --> 00:20:32.374
- I mean my <i>other</i>
other mother.

215
00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:34.749
Mom Number One?

216
00:20:34.916 --> 00:20:37.749
- Hoo-hoo!
- I think I should get to bed.

217
00:20:37.916 --> 00:20:40.124
- Of course, sweetheart.
It's all made up.

218
00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:42.749
- But--
- Come along, sleepyhead.

219
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:53.832
Wow.

220
00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:57.957
- Hello, Coraline!
- Hello!

221
00:20:58.124 --> 00:20:59.207
- What's shakin', baby?

222
00:20:59.374 --> 00:21:01.582
Hello.

223
00:21:07.374 --> 00:21:09.916
- Hey, how's it goin',
Loper?

224
00:21:10.082 --> 00:21:12.166
- Where's your swampers
and toque?

225
00:21:12.332 --> 00:21:14.582
- Cripes almighty!
How are my best trolls?

226
00:21:14.749 --> 00:21:17.624
I can't wait till summer.
You're both comin', right?

227
00:21:17.791 --> 00:21:21.499
- We're already here, Coraline.
- Gone to Oregon?

228
00:21:23.832 --> 00:21:26.207
- Oh.

229
00:21:26.374 --> 00:21:27.499
The mud.

230
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:40.041
- See you soon.
- See you soon.

231
00:22:06.749 --> 00:22:08.666
It's gone!

232
00:22:08.832 --> 00:22:11.249
My poison oak! It's gone!

233
00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:15.832
Huh.

234
00:22:19.416 --> 00:22:21.791
- It was incredibly
real, Mom.

235
00:22:21.957 --> 00:22:24.624
Only you weren't really you.
You were my Other Mother.

236
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:26.457
- Buttons for eyes, huh?

237
00:22:26.624 --> 00:22:29.541
Coraline, you only dreamed
you ate all that chicken.

238
00:22:29.707 --> 00:22:31.249
Take your multivitamin, at least.

239
00:22:31.416 --> 00:22:32.999
- You were in
the dream too, Dad.

240
00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:35.791
You had wild-looking pajamas
and orange monkey slippers.

241
00:22:35.957 --> 00:22:38.082
Orange?

242
00:22:38.249 --> 00:22:39.957
My monkey slippers are blue.

243
00:22:40.124 --> 00:22:41.499
Psst. Can you get me

244
00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:43.332
some of that magic mud
you were talking about?

245
00:22:43.499 --> 00:22:47.291
Because I have a terrible
case of writers' rash on my...

246
00:22:47.457 --> 00:22:48.832
- Ahem!

247
00:22:50.624 --> 00:22:53.249
- If the real Charlie Jones
wants his pages edited,

248
00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:55.791
he'd better wrap them up ASAP.

249
00:22:57.791 --> 00:23:00.416
Coraline, why don't you
go visit downstairs?

250
00:23:00.582 --> 00:23:04.124
I bet those actresses would
love to hear your dreams.

251
00:23:04.291 --> 00:23:06.291
- Miss Spink
and Forcible?

252
00:23:06.457 --> 00:23:08.082
But you said they're dingbats!

253
00:23:08.249 --> 00:23:09.832
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:23:21.207 --> 00:23:26.541
- Bob in sky, Bob in sky,
Bob in sky.

255
00:23:30.124 --> 00:23:33.041
Ugh! Poo-wee!

256
00:23:50.041 --> 00:23:52.249
- Hello?

257
00:23:52.416 --> 00:23:55.707
I think our mail got mixed up!

258
00:23:55.874 --> 00:23:57.582
Shall I leave it outside or--

259
00:24:07.916 --> 00:24:10.291
- Hmm.

260
00:24:12.082 --> 00:24:13.416
- Secret!

261
00:24:14.957 --> 00:24:18.582
- Famous jumping
mouse circus not ready...

262
00:24:18.749 --> 00:24:21.291
...little girl.

263
00:24:21.457 --> 00:24:22.957
- Circus?

264
00:24:23.124 --> 00:24:27.541
Oh, I brought this for you.

265
00:24:30.457 --> 00:24:32.041
Mmm.

266
00:24:33.707 --> 00:24:34.874
- Huh?

267
00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:37.207
- New cheese samples?

268
00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:43.499
Very clever, using this mix-up

269
00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:46.624
to sneak in my home and peek at <i>mooshkas.</i>

270
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:49.082
- "Mooshkas"?
- The mice!

271
00:24:49.249 --> 00:24:51.791
- Oh, sorry.

272
00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:54.082
I'm Coraline Jones.

273
00:24:54.249 --> 00:24:57.582
-And I am
the Amazing Bob in sky.

274
00:24:59.666 --> 00:25:01.791
But you call me Mr. B.

275
00:25:01.957 --> 00:25:06.666
Because amazing, I already know that I am.

276
00:25:06.832 --> 00:25:08.749
- Wha...?

277
00:25:12.291 --> 00:25:14.541
- Ha!
You see, Caroline?

278
00:25:14.707 --> 00:25:18.749
The problem is my new songs
go "Oompah, oompah."

279
00:25:18.916 --> 00:25:22.791
But the jumping mice play
only "Toodle-toot," like that.

280
00:25:22.957 --> 00:25:26.457
It's nice, but not so much amazing.

281
00:25:26.624 --> 00:25:29.207
So now I switch to stronger cheese,

282
00:25:29.374 --> 00:25:30.999
and soon... watch out!

283
00:25:33.457 --> 00:25:37.666
Here, have beet. Make you strong.

284
00:25:39.582 --> 00:25:42.332
<i>Do svidaniya</i>, Caroline.

285
00:25:43.499 --> 00:25:45.624
- Cor-aline.

286
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:52.791
"Oompah-oompah."

287
00:25:52.957 --> 00:25:54.791
"Toodle-toot. Toodle-toot--"

288
00:25:54.957 --> 00:25:56.707
- Hey, Caroline!

289
00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:00.707
- Wait!
- No!

290
00:26:00.874 --> 00:26:04.124
- Hmm.

291
00:26:04.291 --> 00:26:07.332
The mice asked me to give you message.

292
00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:09.666
- The jumping mice?

293
00:26:09.832 --> 00:26:12.291
- They are saying,

294
00:26:12.457 --> 00:26:14.374
"Do not go through little door."

295
00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:17.291
Do you know such a thing?

296
00:26:17.457 --> 00:26:19.791
- The one
behind the wallpaper?

297
00:26:19.957 --> 00:26:23.291
But it's all bricked up.

298
00:26:23.457 --> 00:26:26.749
- Bah. So sorry.
Is nothing.

299
00:26:26.916 --> 00:26:30.124
Sometimes the mice are
a little mixed up, hmm?

300
00:26:32.707 --> 00:26:35.166
They even get your name wrong, you know?

301
00:26:35.332 --> 00:26:37.999
They call you "Coraline"
instead of "Caroline."

302
00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:40.291
Not Caroline at all!

303
00:26:40.457 --> 00:26:42.624
Maybe I work them too hard.

304
00:27:20.624 --> 00:27:24.207
- Oh, cease
your infernal yapping!

305
00:27:24.374 --> 00:27:26.832
Oh, how nice to see you, Caroline.

306
00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:28.457
Would you like to come in?

307
00:27:28.624 --> 00:27:29.832
We're playing cards.

308
00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:31.832
- Still Coraline,
Miss Spink.

309
00:27:31.999 --> 00:27:34.416
- Miriam!
Put the kettle on!

310
00:27:45.582 --> 00:27:47.999
- April, I think
you're being followed!

311
00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:50.874
- It's the new
neighbor, Miriam.

312
00:27:51.041 --> 00:27:52.791
Caroline.

313
00:27:52.957 --> 00:27:55.082
<i>She'll be having the oolong tea.</i>

314
00:27:55.249 --> 00:27:58.541
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sure she'd prefer jasmine.

315
00:27:58.707 --> 00:28:00.707
- No, oolong.

316
00:28:00.874 --> 00:28:03.082
- Ah, jasmine it is, then.

317
00:28:06.916 --> 00:28:08.874
- Come on, boys!

318
00:28:16.457 --> 00:28:18.624
- Are those dogs real?

319
00:28:18.791 --> 00:28:22.207
- Our sweet departed angels.

320
00:28:22.374 --> 00:28:24.332
Couldn't bear to part with them.

321
00:28:24.499 --> 00:28:26.707
So we had them stuffed.

322
00:28:26.874 --> 00:28:29.041
<i>Now there's Hamish the Third...</i>

323
00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:31.374
- Oh, go on.
Have one.

324
00:28:31.541 --> 00:28:34.666
It's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton.

325
00:28:34.832 --> 00:28:36.624
Best in the world.

326
00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:38.041
<i>- ...the Third, the Ninth?</i>

327
00:28:38.207 --> 00:28:39.707
<i>Yes, the Fourth, I'm right--</i>

328
00:28:39.874 --> 00:28:41.374
<i>And Jock Jr. Jock Sr.,</i>

329
00:28:41.541 --> 00:28:43.249
<i>Jock the Third, the Fourth--</i>

330
00:28:43.416 --> 00:28:46.582
<i>oh, and that's Jock's
cousin twice removed.</i>

331
00:28:46.749 --> 00:28:49.374
I'll read them if you like.

332
00:28:50.457 --> 00:28:51.749
- Read what?

333
00:28:51.916 --> 00:28:53.582
- Oh, your tea leaves, dear.

334
00:28:53.749 --> 00:28:56.832
They'll tell me your future.

335
00:28:56.999 --> 00:28:59.541
<i>Drink up, then. Go on.</i>

336
00:28:59.707 --> 00:29:01.124
<i>No, not all of it, not all of it.</i>

337
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:03.457
That's right. Now hand it over.

338
00:29:06.832 --> 00:29:08.916
Oh...

339
00:29:09.082 --> 00:29:10.416
oh, Caroline.

340
00:29:10.582 --> 00:29:12.749
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.

341
00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:16.624
<i>You are in terrible danger.</i>

342
00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:18.791
- Oh, give me
that cup, April.

343
00:29:18.957 --> 00:29:20.291
Your eyes are going.

344
00:29:20.457 --> 00:29:23.374
- My eyes?
<i>You're</i> blind as a bat!

345
00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:27.041
- Oh, now.
Well, not to worry, child.

346
00:29:27.207 --> 00:29:29.166
It's good news.

347
00:29:29.332 --> 00:29:32.999
There's a tall handsome
beast in your future.

348
00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:34.541
- A what?

349
00:29:34.707 --> 00:29:38.291
- Miriam, really.
You're holding it wrong.

350
00:29:38.457 --> 00:29:40.582
See? Danger.

351
00:29:40.749 --> 00:29:41.749
<i>- What do you see?</i>

352
00:29:41.916 --> 00:29:44.999
- I see a very peculiar hand.

353
00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:47.291
- I see a giraffe.

354
00:29:47.457 --> 00:29:50.624
- Giraffes don't just fall
from the sky, Miriam!

355
00:29:50.791 --> 00:29:52.166
Oh, Lord!

356
00:29:52.332 --> 00:29:55.082
- Well, what should I do?

357
00:29:55.249 --> 00:29:57.624
- Never wear green
in your dressing room.

358
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:00.457
- Acquire a very tall
stepladder.

359
00:30:00.624 --> 00:30:02.999
And be very, very careful.

360
00:30:03.166 --> 00:30:05.082
Oh!

361
00:30:05.249 --> 00:30:08.249
Now was there something
you came to tell us?

362
00:30:09.957 --> 00:30:12.707
- No. I guess not.
Thanks for the tea, though.

363
00:30:12.874 --> 00:30:15.082
- <i>Toodle-oo.</i>
<i>- Cheery-bye.</i>

364
00:30:15.249 --> 00:30:17.291
<i>Do you have any nice Queens for Mummy?</i>

365
00:30:22.749 --> 00:30:24.416
- Danger?

366
00:30:42.332 --> 00:30:43.332
- Oh!

367
00:30:43.499 --> 00:30:44.624
- Great!
The village stalker!

368
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:47.457
- Ow!
I wasn't stalking you.

369
00:30:47.624 --> 00:30:49.624
We're hunting banana slugs.

370
00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:50.916
- What do you mean, we?

371
00:30:53.791 --> 00:30:57.416
- Ha! Your cat's not wild!
He's a wuss puss!

372
00:30:57.582 --> 00:30:58.874
- What?

373
00:30:59.041 --> 00:31:00.957
He hates to get his feet wet. Jeez!

374
00:31:01.124 --> 00:31:02.916
- Wuss puss.

375
00:31:06.374 --> 00:31:10.332
So that doll, did you
make it look like me?

376
00:31:10.499 --> 00:31:11.499
- Oh, no!

377
00:31:11.666 --> 00:31:13.541
I found it that way.

378
00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:15.124
It's older than Grandma.

379
00:31:15.291 --> 00:31:17.457
Old as this house, probably.

380
00:31:17.624 --> 00:31:19.166
- Come on. Blue hair,

381
00:31:19.332 --> 00:31:21.082
my swampers and raincoat?

382
00:31:21.249 --> 00:31:24.207
- Hey!
Check out "Slugzilla!'"

383
00:31:25.707 --> 00:31:27.707
- You're just like them.

384
00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:29.916
- Huh?

385
00:31:30.082 --> 00:31:31.457
- I meant my parents.

386
00:31:31.624 --> 00:31:33.124
They don't listen to me either.

387
00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:35.207
- Mm-hmm.
Do you mind?

388
00:31:37.332 --> 00:31:39.957
Nom, nom...

389
00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:44.249
Hmm...
- Ew!

390
00:31:50.749 --> 00:31:53.624
- You know, I've never been
inside the Pink Palace.

391
00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:55.957
- You're kidding.

392
00:31:56.124 --> 00:31:57.457
- Grandma'd kill me.

393
00:31:57.624 --> 00:31:59.749
Thinks it's dangerous or something.

394
00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:01.666
- Dangerous?

395
00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:04.666
- Well, she had
a twin sister.

396
00:32:04.832 --> 00:32:06.582
-So?

397
00:32:06.749 --> 00:32:09.207
- When they were kids,
Grandma's sister disappeared.

398
00:32:09.374 --> 00:32:12.041
She says she was stolen.

399
00:32:12.207 --> 00:32:14.082
<i>Stolen?</i>

400
00:32:14.249 --> 00:32:16.957
Well, what do you think?

401
00:32:17.124 --> 00:32:20.291
- Uh, I don't know.
Maybe she just ran away.

402
00:32:20.457 --> 00:32:23.082
<i>Wyborne!</i>

403
00:32:23.249 --> 00:32:25.832
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait a minute!

404
00:32:27.624 --> 00:32:29.291
Hmm.

405
00:33:41.249 --> 00:33:42.624
- Welcome back, darling.

406
00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:44.416
- Hi.

407
00:33:44.582 --> 00:33:47.207
- So thoughtful of you to send
this nice cheddar, Coraline.

408
00:33:47.374 --> 00:33:48.707
- Cheddar?

409
00:33:48.874 --> 00:33:51.832
Oh! The mice bait.

410
00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:53.791
- Would you go
fetch your father?

411
00:33:53.957 --> 00:33:56.166
I bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.

412
00:33:56.332 --> 00:33:59.041
- You mean,
my Other Father?

413
00:33:59.207 --> 00:34:01.791
- Your better father, dear.
He's out in the garden.

414
00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:04.207
- But my parents
don't have time to garden.

415
00:34:04.374 --> 00:34:05.874
- Shh! Shh!

416
00:34:06.041 --> 00:34:07.499
- Mmm.

417
00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:09.082
- Go on.

418
00:34:39.457 --> 00:34:40.624
Oh!

419
00:35:00.207 --> 00:35:02.832
- Hey!

420
00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:04.874
- I love your garden!

421
00:35:05.041 --> 00:35:07.541
- Our garden, Coraline.

422
00:35:10.832 --> 00:35:13.374
Stop tickling me!

423
00:35:15.041 --> 00:35:18.457
- Oh, daughter in distress.

424
00:35:30.749 --> 00:35:34.707
- Tickle no more,
you dragonsnappers.

425
00:35:36.457 --> 00:35:38.499
- Well, she said
it's time for dinner.

426
00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:41.082
Breakfast? Food?

427
00:35:41.249 --> 00:35:44.249
- Hop on, kiddo.
I wanna show you something.

428
00:35:54.624 --> 00:35:56.791
- I can't believe
you did this!

429
00:35:56.957 --> 00:35:58.707
- Mother said you'd like it.

430
00:35:58.874 --> 00:36:01.791
For she knows you like
the back of her hand.

431
00:36:05.624 --> 00:36:07.166
- Mmm, so good.

432
00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:09.624
- I love dinner
breakfast food.

433
00:36:09.791 --> 00:36:12.457
- Coraline, Mr. Bob in sky
has invited you

434
00:36:12.624 --> 00:36:14.707
to come see the jumping mice
perform after dinner.

435
00:36:14.874 --> 00:36:17.499
- Really?
That know-it-all Wybie said

436
00:36:17.666 --> 00:36:20.457
it was all in Mr. B's head.
I knew he was wrong.

437
00:36:20.624 --> 00:36:22.957
- Well, everything's right
in this world, kiddo.

438
00:36:23.124 --> 00:36:24.624
- Your father and I
will clean up

439
00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:28.291
while you and your "friend" head upstairs.

440
00:36:28.457 --> 00:36:30.166
- My friend?

441
00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:34.624
Great. Another Wybie.

442
00:36:34.791 --> 00:36:37.999
Hello, "Why-were-you-borne."

443
00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:40.624
Hello?

444
00:36:40.791 --> 00:36:44.124
- I thought you'd like him more
if he spoke a little less.

445
00:36:44.291 --> 00:36:45.749
So I fixed him.

446
00:36:45.916 --> 00:36:48.624
- So he can't talk at all?

447
00:36:48.791 --> 00:36:50.707
- Nope.
- Hmm.

448
00:36:50.874 --> 00:36:52.457
I like it.

449
00:36:52.624 --> 00:36:55.582
- Now run along, you two,
and have fun.

450
00:36:58.582 --> 00:36:59.957
- You're awful cheerful,

451
00:37:00.124 --> 00:37:03.957
considering you can't say anything.

452
00:37:04.124 --> 00:37:07.666
Um, it didn't hurt, did it, when she...

453
00:37:20.666 --> 00:37:21.749
- Whoa!

454
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:28.207
<i>Cool!</i>

455
00:37:43.999 --> 00:37:46.624
Look at you!

456
00:37:47.957 --> 00:37:50.416
<i>Lady and gentleman!</i>

457
00:37:50.582 --> 00:37:53.332
<i>For to tickle your eyes and ears</i>

458
00:37:53.499 --> 00:37:56.457
<i>and making hearts to thump,</i>

<i>I, Sergei Alexander Bob in sky,</i>

00:38:04.541 --> 00:38:08.416
<i>stupen-dulous and amazing</i>

462
00:38:08.582 --> 00:38:11.624
<i>Jumping Mouse Circus!</i>

463
00:38:15.291 --> 00:38:18.249
- My name!

464
00:38:39.166 --> 00:38:41.957
- It's wonderful, Wybie!

465
00:38:56.624 --> 00:38:58.749
Wow!

466
00:39:17.499 --> 00:39:21.666
- Yeah! Whoo!
That was great!

467
00:39:21.832 --> 00:39:25.457
- Very, very thank you,
lady and gentleman.

468
00:39:41.457 --> 00:39:45.666
- We loved it, Mr. B.
It was so, so...

469
00:39:45.832 --> 00:39:47.416
- Ah...

470
00:39:47.582 --> 00:39:48.666
- Amazing!

471
00:39:48.832 --> 00:39:51.499
- You are very welcome
any time you like.

472
00:39:51.666 --> 00:39:54.332
You and also your good friend there.

473
00:39:54.499 --> 00:39:56.707
<i>Do svidaniya</i>, Coraline.

474
00:40:39.707 --> 00:40:41.957
- There were garden squash
like balloon animals

475
00:40:42.124 --> 00:40:43.416
and snapdragons.

476
00:40:43.582 --> 00:40:46.457
Oh, and upstairs I saw
a real mouse circus.

477
00:40:46.624 --> 00:40:49.166
Not pretend like
the crazy man's in our house.

478
00:40:49.332 --> 00:40:51.291
- You sure you won't come?

479
00:40:51.457 --> 00:40:53.957
- Don't fret, Charlie.
They'll love the new catalog.

480
00:40:54.124 --> 00:40:56.041
At least they'll love my chapters.

481
00:40:56.207 --> 00:40:57.999
I did not call him crazy, Coraline.

482
00:40:58.166 --> 00:40:59.791
He's drunk.

483
00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:02.999
- Well, I guess I'll see you
around, you dizzy dreamer.

484
00:41:03.166 --> 00:41:06.124
- Dad!
I'm not five anymore!

485
00:41:15.582 --> 00:41:18.291
Ah!

486
00:41:31.624 --> 00:41:35.124
- My kingdom for a horse!

487
00:41:47.874 --> 00:41:49.624
- Put them back.

488
00:41:49.791 --> 00:41:52.874
- But, Mom, the whole school's
gonna wear boring gray clothes.

489
00:41:53.041 --> 00:41:55.582
No one will have these.

490
00:41:55.749 --> 00:41:58.041
- Put them back.

491
00:41:58.207 --> 00:42:00.832
- My Other Mother
would get them.

492
00:42:00.999 --> 00:42:03.499
- Maybe she should buy
all your clothes.

493
00:42:08.124 --> 00:42:09.791
- Coraline] So what do you
think's in the other apartment?

494
00:42:09.957 --> 00:42:11.999
- I don't know.

495
00:42:12.166 --> 00:42:14.374
Not a family of Jones imposters.

496
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:16.457
- Then why'd you lock
the door?

497
00:42:16.624 --> 00:42:18.374
- Oh, I found
some rat crap.

498
00:42:18.541 --> 00:42:21.666
And I thought you'd feel safer.

499
00:42:21.832 --> 00:42:23.791
- They're jumping mice, Mom.

500
00:42:23.957 --> 00:42:26.082
And the dreams aren't dangerous.

501
00:42:26.249 --> 00:42:29.749
They're the most fun I've had
since we've moved here.

502
00:42:29.916 --> 00:42:31.082
- Your school might be fun.

503
00:42:31.249 --> 00:42:34.874
- With those stupid uniforms?
Right.

504
00:42:35.041 --> 00:42:36.999
- Had to give it a try.

505
00:42:50.332 --> 00:42:54.124
How do you feel about a mustard,
ketchup, salsa wrap for lunch?

506
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:55.624
- Are you kidding me?

507
00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:58.249
- Hmm. Had to go
food shopping anyway.

508
00:42:58.416 --> 00:43:01.207
Dad's planning something special.

509
00:43:01.374 --> 00:43:02.832
- Disgusting!

510
00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:04.666
- You wanna come along?

511
00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:06.249
You can pick out something you like.

512
00:43:06.416 --> 00:43:08.624
- Oh, like the gloves?

513
00:43:08.791 --> 00:43:10.666
Look, Coraline,

514
00:43:10.832 --> 00:43:14.457
if things go well today,
I promise I'll make it up.

515
00:43:14.624 --> 00:43:17.124
- That's what you
always say.

516
00:43:20.457 --> 00:43:22.416
- Won't be long.

517
00:43:22.582 --> 00:43:25.207
- But <i>I</i> might be.

518
00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:07.124
I knew it was real!

519
00:44:30.041 --> 00:44:32.041
<i>"Dearest Coraline.</i>

520
00:44:32.207 --> 00:44:33.791

<i>Love, Mother."</i>

524
00:44:51.416 --> 00:44:54.624
- Hmm. Wybie's got a cat
like you at home.

525
00:44:56.374 --> 00:44:59.749
Not the quiet Wybie,
the one that talks too much.

526
00:44:59.916 --> 00:45:02.666
You must be the Other Cat.

527
00:45:02.832 --> 00:45:05.957
- No. I'm not
the other anything.

528
00:45:06.124 --> 00:45:07.416
I'm <i>me.</i>

529
00:45:07.582 --> 00:45:10.541
-Um, I can see
you don't have button eyes.

530
00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:14.249
But if you're the same cat,
how can you talk?

531
00:45:14.416 --> 00:45:16.916
- I just can.

532
00:45:17.082 --> 00:45:18.832
- Cats don't talk at home.

533
00:45:18.999 --> 00:45:20.624
- No?
<i>- Nope.</i>

534
00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:24.457
- Well, you're clearly
the expert on these things.

535
00:45:24.624 --> 00:45:27.999
After all, I'm just a big fat "wuss puss."

536
00:45:28.166 --> 00:45:30.124
- Come back, please?

537
00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:33.124
I'm sorry I called you that. I really am.

538
00:45:33.291 --> 00:45:34.457
How'd you get here?

539
00:45:34.624 --> 00:45:37.374
- I've been coming here
for a while.

540
00:45:40.249 --> 00:45:42.332
It's a game we play.

541
00:45:42.499 --> 00:45:45.041
She hates cats

542
00:45:45.207 --> 00:45:47.957
and tries to keep me out.
But she can't, of course.

543
00:45:48.124 --> 00:45:50.832
I come and go as I please.

544
00:45:50.999 --> 00:45:52.666
- The Other Mother
hates cats?

545
00:45:52.832 --> 00:45:55.832
- Not like any mother
I've ever known.

546
00:45:55.999 --> 00:45:58.832
- What do you mean?
She's amazing!

547
00:45:58.999 --> 00:46:02.291
- You probably think
this world is a dream come true.

548
00:46:02.457 --> 00:46:04.207
But you're wrong.

549
00:46:04.374 --> 00:46:06.249
The Other Wybie told me so.

550
00:46:06.416 --> 00:46:08.541
- That's nonsense.
He can't talk.

551
00:46:08.707 --> 00:46:10.666
- Perhaps not to you.

552
00:46:10.832 --> 00:46:14.999
We cats, however, have far
superior senses than humans,

553
00:46:15.166 --> 00:46:18.332
and can see and smell and--

554
00:46:18.499 --> 00:46:23.707
Shh-- I hear something right over...

555
00:47:04.541 --> 00:47:06.332
- Hey, Wybie.

556
00:47:20.582 --> 00:47:22.416
She's practically naked!

- Oh!

581
00:49:12.624 --> 00:49:13.957
- I can't look.

582
00:49:14.124 --> 00:49:17.749
- Ready to break
a leg, Miriam?

583
00:49:17.916 --> 00:49:20.999
- Our lives for
the theater, April.

584
00:49:40.499 --> 00:49:43.499
- "What a piece of work is man.

585
00:49:43.666 --> 00:49:45.916
How noble in reason."

586
00:49:46.082 --> 00:49:48.582
- "How infinite in faculty.

587
00:49:48.749 --> 00:49:52.832
In form and moving,
how express and admirable."

588
00:49:52.999 --> 00:49:56.416
- "In action,
like an angel."

589
00:49:56.582 --> 00:50:01.332
- "In apprehension,
how like a god."

590
00:50:02.916 --> 00:50:04.957
- "The beauty of the world."

591
00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:10.916
- "The paragon of animals."

592
00:50:14.416 --> 00:50:16.207
- Yeah!

593
00:50:49.832 --> 00:50:51.707
- Hey, there.

594
00:50:51.874 --> 00:50:53.791
- Was it wonderful, dear?

595
00:50:53.957 --> 00:50:55.499
- Oh, yeah.
They swooped down

596
00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:57.832
and pulled me right out of
my seat, Spink and Forcible.

597
00:50:57.999 --> 00:51:00.874
Only they weren't old ladies.
That was just a disguise.

598
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:03.082
But then I was flying through the air.

599
00:51:03.249 --> 00:51:04.249
And it was...

600
00:51:04.416 --> 00:51:05.541
Oh, it was magic.

601
00:51:05.707 --> 00:51:07.874
- You do like it here,
don't you, Coraline?

602
00:51:08.041 --> 00:51:09.291
- Uh-huh.

603
00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:10.666
Good night, Wybie.

604
00:51:21.499 --> 00:51:24.582
- You could stay here
forever, if you want to.

605
00:51:24.749 --> 00:51:25.916
- Really?

606
00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:28.207
- Sure.
We'll sing and play games.

607
00:51:28.374 --> 00:51:30.249
And Mother will cook your favorite meals.

608
00:51:30.416 --> 00:51:32.999
- There's one tiny little
thing we need to do.

609
00:51:33.166 --> 00:51:34.166
- What's that?

610
00:51:34.332 --> 00:51:36.207
- Well, it's a surprise.

611
00:51:40.124 --> 00:51:42.707
- For you, our little doll.

612
00:51:48.332 --> 00:51:50.999
<i>Black is traditional.</i>

613
00:51:51.166 --> 00:51:56.916
But if you'd prefer pink
or vermillion or chartreuse.

614
00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:00.291
- Though you might
make me jealous.

615
00:52:00.457 --> 00:52:01.791
- No way!

616
00:52:01.957 --> 00:52:03.666
You're not sewing buttons in my eyes!

617
00:52:03.832 --> 00:52:06.666
- Oh, but we need a yes
if you want to stay here.

618
00:52:06.832 --> 00:52:10.166
- So sharp, you won't
feel a thi-- ow!

619
00:52:10.332 --> 00:52:15.332
- There now,
it's your decision, darling.

620
00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.457
We only want what's best for you.

621
00:52:17.624 --> 00:52:19.916
- I'm going to bed
right now!

622
00:52:20.082 --> 00:52:22.332
- Bed?
- Before dinner?

623
00:52:22.499 --> 00:52:25.166
- I'm really,
really tired, yeah.

624
00:52:26.624 --> 00:52:29.249
I just need to sleep on things.

625
00:52:29.416 --> 00:52:30.666
- Well, of course
you do, darling.

626
00:52:30.832 --> 00:52:32.624
I'll be happy to tuck you in.

627
00:52:32.791 --> 00:52:35.332
- Oh, no thanks.
You've done so much already.

628
00:52:35.499 --> 00:52:36.832
- You're welcome.

629
00:52:36.999 --> 00:52:39.332
And I--

630
00:52:39.499 --> 00:52:42.166
We aren't worried at all, darling.

631
00:52:42.332 --> 00:52:46.124
Soon you'll see things our way.

632
00:53:03.291 --> 00:53:05.249
- What's wrong, Coraline?

633
00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:08.291
Don't you wanna play?

634
00:53:08.457 --> 00:53:10.666
- Yeah.
I wanna hug your face.

635
00:53:10.832 --> 00:53:12.749
- Get a grip, soldier!

636
00:53:12.916 --> 00:53:15.707
- Hey, where's your
buttons, Loper?

637
00:53:15.874 --> 00:53:18.082
- You wanna stay, don't you?

638
00:53:18.249 --> 00:53:20.082
- Going home tonight, robots.

639
00:53:20.249 --> 00:53:23.374
And I won't... be... back.

640
00:53:29.832 --> 00:53:32.832
- Go to sleep, go to sleep.

641
00:53:32.999 --> 00:53:34.541
<i>Little thing we need to do.</i>

642
00:53:34.707 --> 00:53:35.749
<i>So sharp, you won't</i>

643
00:53:35.916 --> 00:53:37.124
<i>feel a thing.</i>

644
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:38.582
- Go to sleep, go to sleep.

645
00:53:38.749 --> 00:53:40.749
<i>- Soon you'll see things
our way.</i>

646
00:53:48.999 --> 00:53:52.041
- Mom!
Dad!

647
00:53:52.207 --> 00:53:54.916
Oh, God.

648
00:53:55.082 --> 00:53:56.791
I'm still here?

649
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:16.791
- Hey, you!
Where's the Other Mother?

650
00:54:16.957 --> 00:54:18.749
I wanna go home!

651
00:54:18.916 --> 00:54:22.249
All will be swell soon
as Mother's refreshed.

652
00:54:22.416 --> 00:54:24.707
Her strength is our strength.

653
00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:31.499
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

654
00:54:31.666 --> 00:54:34.166
- If you won't even talk to me,
I'm gonna find the Other Wybie.

655
00:54:34.332 --> 00:54:36.957
He'll help me.
- No point.

656
00:54:37.124 --> 00:54:39.999
He pulled a long face.

657
00:54:40.166 --> 00:54:41.457
And Mother didn't like it.

658
00:54:42.624 --> 00:54:44.166
- Oh!

659
00:55:05.957 --> 00:55:08.707
And what do you think you're doing?

660
00:55:08.874 --> 00:55:11.874
- Well, I'm getting
out of here.

661
00:55:12.041 --> 00:55:13.374
That's what I'm doing.

662
00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:17.832
Huh? Something's wrong.

663
00:55:17.999 --> 00:55:19.291
Shouldn't the old well be here?

664
00:55:19.457 --> 00:55:21.166
- Nothing out here.

665
00:55:21.332 --> 00:55:23.957
It's the empty part of this world.

666
00:55:24.124 --> 00:55:27.666
She only made what
she knew would impress you.

667
00:55:27.832 --> 00:55:28.999
- But why?

668
00:55:29.166 --> 00:55:30.916
Why does she want me?

669
00:55:31.082 --> 00:55:33.791
- She wants something
to love, I think.

670
00:55:33.957 --> 00:55:36.291
Something that isn't her.

671
00:55:36.457 --> 00:55:41.124
Or maybe she just loves something to eat.

672
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:42.874
- Eat?

673
00:55:43.041 --> 00:55:45.541
That's ridiculous.
Mothers don't eat daughters.

674
00:55:45.707 --> 00:55:48.582
- I don't know.
How do you taste?

675
00:55:55.999 --> 00:55:57.499
- Huh?

676
00:55:57.666 --> 00:56:00.707
But how can you walk away from something

677
00:56:00.874 --> 00:56:03.291
and still come back to it?

678
00:56:04.457 --> 00:56:06.832
- Walk around the world.

679
00:56:06.999 --> 00:56:08.832
- Small world.

680
00:56:08.999 --> 00:56:10.916
Hang on!

681
00:56:14.832 --> 00:56:18.541
- Stop!
He's one of the circus mice!

682
00:56:26.874 --> 00:56:29.666
- |I don't like rats
at the best of times.

683
00:56:29.832 --> 00:56:33.624
But this one was sounding an alarm.

684
00:56:35.874 --> 00:56:37.457
- Good Kitty.

685
00:57:14.207 --> 00:57:17.666
- They say even the proudest
spirit can be broken...

686
00:57:17.832 --> 00:57:19.457
with love.

687
00:57:23.999 --> 00:57:26.666
- Of course, chocolate
never hurts.

688
00:57:26.832 --> 00:57:28.707
Like one?

689
00:57:28.874 --> 00:57:32.832
They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.

690
00:57:34.082 --> 00:57:35.999
- Ugh!

691
00:57:36.166 --> 00:57:38.374
I want to be

692
00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:41.124
with my real mom and dad!

693
00:57:41.291 --> 00:57:43.957
I want you to let me go!

694
00:57:45.499 --> 00:57:47.416
- Is that any way
to talk to your mother?

695
00:57:47.582 --> 00:57:50.082
- You aren't my mother.

696
00:57:50.249 --> 00:57:55.166
- Apologize at once,
Coraline!

697
00:57:55.332 --> 00:57:58.124
- No!

698
00:57:58.291 --> 00:58:00.832
- I'll give you
to the count of three.

699
00:58:02.499 --> 00:58:05.207
One...

700
00:58:05.374 --> 00:58:08.499
two...

701
00:58:08.666 --> 00:58:10.332
three!

702
00:58:10.499 --> 00:58:13.166
- Ow!
What are you doing?

703
00:58:13.332 --> 00:58:15.832
Ow, that hurts!

704
00:58:18.541 --> 00:58:22.416
- You may come out when you've
learned to be a loving daughter!

705
00:58:34.499 --> 00:58:35.791
Who's there?

706
00:58:35.957 --> 00:58:38.499
- Hush and shush.

707
00:58:38.666 --> 00:58:41.457
For the Beldam might be listening.

708
00:58:41.624 --> 00:58:44.124
- You...

709
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:46.707
you mean, the Other Mother?

710
00:58:57.249 --> 00:58:59.707
Who are you?

711
00:58:59.874 --> 00:59:02.457
- Don't remember our names.

712
00:59:02.624 --> 00:59:06.749
But I remember my true mommy.

713
00:59:06.916 --> 00:59:09.541
- Why are you all here?

714
00:59:09.707 --> 00:59:11.999
- The Beldam.

715
00:59:12.166 --> 00:59:17.291
- She spied on our lives
through the little doll's eyes.

716
00:59:17.457 --> 00:59:21.291
- And saw
that we weren't happy.

717
00:59:21.457 --> 00:59:25.207
- So she lured us away
with treasures and treats...

718
00:59:25.374 --> 00:59:27.666
- And games to play.

719
00:59:27.832 --> 00:59:29.499
- Gave all that we asked

720
00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:32.666
- Yet we still wanted more.

721
00:59:32.832 --> 00:59:36.541
- So we let her
sew the buttons.

722
00:59:39.999 --> 00:59:42.082
- She said
that she loved us.

723
00:59:42.249 --> 00:59:44.957
But she locked us here...

724
00:59:45.124 --> 00:59:47.666
And ate up our lives.

725
00:59:49.457 --> 00:59:55.166
- Well, she can't keep me
in the dark forever.

726
00:59:55.332 --> 00:59:59.624
Not if she wants to win my life.

727
00:59:59.791 --> 01:00:03.291
Beating her is my only chance.

728
01:00:03.457 --> 01:00:06.499
- Perhaps if you do
win your escape,

729
01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:08.499
you could find our eyes.

730
01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:10.832
- Has she taken those too?

731
01:00:10.999 --> 01:00:13.832
- Yes, miss,
and hidden them.

732
01:00:13.999 --> 01:00:15.916
- Find our eyes,
mistress,

733
01:00:16.082 --> 01:00:19.832
and our souls will be freed.

734
01:00:19.999 --> 01:00:22.791
- I'll try.

735
01:00:30.082 --> 01:00:31.499
- Wybie?

736
01:00:34.249 --> 01:00:36.249
Did she do this to you?

737
01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:45.291
<i>I hope that feels better.</i>
- Shh!

738
01:00:50.999 --> 01:00:53.832
- <i>Coraline?
- Is that you?</i>

739
01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:55.666
- Let's go!

740
01:00:58.791 --> 01:01:01.499
<i>Coraline?</i>

741
01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:04.832
- Come on.
She'll hurt you again.

742
01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.666
- Coraline?

743
01:01:11.832 --> 01:01:13.916
How dare you disobey your mother!

744
01:01:17.416 --> 01:01:20.041
<i>- Coraline?</i>

745
01:01:33.332 --> 01:01:35.666
I'm home!

746
01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:40.582
Anybody here?

747
01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:45.166
Hello? Hello, hello?

748
01:01:45.332 --> 01:01:48.499
Real Dad?

749
01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:49.957
Real Mom?

750
01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:52.707
Oh, Mom's groceries!

751
01:01:54.832 --> 01:01:57.666
Oh, that's disgusting.

752
01:02:00.957 --> 01:02:02.541
- I missed you guys
so much!

753
01:02:02.707 --> 01:02:04.166
You'll never--

754
01:02:04.332 --> 01:02:07.207
Oh, the Wybie that talks.

755
01:02:07.374 --> 01:02:09.499
Huh?

756
01:02:09.666 --> 01:02:14.291
Yeah. So you know that
old doll I gave you?

757
01:02:14.457 --> 01:02:16.582
Um, my grandma's real mad.

758
01:02:16.749 --> 01:02:20.041
Says it was her sister's,
the one that disappeared?

759
01:02:20.207 --> 01:02:22.124
- You stole that doll,
didn't you?

760
01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:24.499
- Well, it looked
just like you.

761
01:02:24.666 --> 01:02:25.874
And I figured...

762
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:28.124
- It used to look
like this pioneer girl.

763
01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:29.457
Then Huck Finn, Jr.

764
01:02:29.624 --> 01:02:31.082
Then it was this "Little Rascals" chick

765
01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:32.874
with all these ribbons and braids!

766
01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:35.707
Grandma's missing sister!

767
01:02:35.874 --> 01:02:38.832
I think I just met her. Come on.

768
01:02:38.999 --> 01:02:42.457
- Listen, I'm really
not supposed to-- whoa!

769
01:02:47.541 --> 01:02:49.332
- She's in there.

770
01:02:51.124 --> 01:02:53.707
- Can you unlock it?

771
01:02:53.874 --> 01:02:56.374
- Not in a million years.
But it wouldn't matter.

772
01:02:56.541 --> 01:02:58.332
She can't escape without her eyes.

773
01:02:58.499 --> 01:03:00.416
None of the ghosts can.

774
01:03:00.582 --> 01:03:03.332
- Uh... yeah.

775
01:03:03.499 --> 01:03:05.957
So I really need to get that doll.

776
01:03:06.124 --> 01:03:08.207
- Great!
I'd love to get rid of it.

777
01:03:09.874 --> 01:03:11.999
Where are you hiding, you little monster?

778
01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:14.124
- You and Grandma
been talkin'?

779
01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:15.582
- The doll's her spy!

780
01:03:15.749 --> 01:03:17.082
It's how she watches you.

781
01:03:17.249 --> 01:03:18.999
Finds out what's wrong with your life.

782
01:03:19.166 --> 01:03:21.666
- The doll is
my grandma's spy?

783
01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:23.541
- No, the Other Mother.

784
01:03:23.707 --> 01:03:25.416
She's got this whole world
where everything's better.

785
01:03:25.582 --> 01:03:28.874
The food, the garden, the neighbors.

786
01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:30.957
But it's all a trap.

787
01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:35.999
Yeah, I think I heard
someone calling me, Jonesy.

788
01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:38.332
- You don't believe me?
You can ask the cat!

789
01:03:38.499 --> 01:03:40.249
- The cat?

790
01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:43.749
I'll just tell Grandma that
you couldn't find the doll.

791
01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:45.707
Ow!
- You're not listening to me!

792
01:03:45.874 --> 01:03:48.749
- That's 'cause you're
<i>crazy!</i>

793
01:03:54.166 --> 01:03:56.374
- You creep!
- Crazy!

794
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.916
- Crazy?

795
01:03:58.082 --> 01:04:00.457
You're the jerk wad that gave me the doll!

796
01:04:01.666 --> 01:04:03.666
Mom? Dad?

797
01:04:10.666 --> 01:04:14.166
Pick it up, Dad, pick it up.

798
01:04:14.332 --> 01:04:16.499
<i>- Hi...</i>
- Dad!

799
01:04:16.666 --> 01:04:18.207
<i>- I'm digging in
my garden right now.</i>

800
01:04:18.374 --> 01:04:19.666
<i>But leave a message</i>

801
01:04:19.832 --> 01:04:21.791
<i>and I'll get right back to you.</i>

802
01:04:21.957 --> 01:04:23.666
- Where have you gone?

803
01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:35.082
Uh, don't you only make
wings for the dead ones?

804
01:04:35.249 --> 01:04:36.666
- Just looking ahead, dear.

805
01:04:36.832 --> 01:04:39.624
Angus hasn't been feeling
very well of late.

806
01:04:39.791 --> 01:04:41.666
<i>- April?
Aren't you getting ready?</i>

807
01:04:41.832 --> 01:04:43.791
- We've lost our ride,
Miriam.

808
01:04:43.957 --> 01:04:47.457
<i>Caroline says her parents have
vanished quite completely.</i>

809
01:04:47.624 --> 01:04:48.916
- What?

810
01:04:49.082 --> 01:04:51.166
We've waited months for those tickets!

811
01:04:51.332 --> 01:04:53.374
- I suppose we could walk.

812
01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:54.957
- With your gammy legs?

813
01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:59.249
It's nearly two miles to the theater!

814
01:04:59.416 --> 01:05:00.999
Ahem!

815
01:05:01.166 --> 01:05:04.582
- Oh, oh, yes.
Your missing parents.

816
01:05:04.749 --> 01:05:07.666
<i>We know just what you need.</i>

817
01:05:07.832 --> 01:05:11.124
Miriam, get-- that's right.

818
01:05:13.624 --> 01:05:15.499
- How is 100-year-old
candy gonna help?

819
01:05:29.332 --> 01:05:32.207
- There you go, sweetie.

820
01:05:32.374 --> 01:05:33.582
- What's it for?

821
01:05:33.749 --> 01:05:35.249
- Well, it might help.

822
01:05:35.416 --> 01:05:37.707
They're good for bad things sometimes.

823
01:05:37.874 --> 01:05:40.374
- No, they're good
for lost things.

824
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.499
<i>- It's bad things, Miriam.</i>

825
01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:44.541
<i>- Lost things, April.</i>

826
01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.499
<i>- Bad.
- Lost.</i>

827
01:05:46.666 --> 01:05:48.207
<i>- Bad things!
- Lost!</i>

828
01:05:48.374 --> 01:05:49.374
<i>- Bad!
- Lost!</i>

829
01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:50.541
<i>- Bad!
- Lost!</i>

830
01:05:50.707 --> 01:05:52.166
<i>- Bad!
- Lost!</i>

831
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:21.707
- Good night, Mom.

832
01:06:21.874 --> 01:06:23.666
Good night, Dad.

833
01:06:53.374 --> 01:06:55.207
<i>Hello.</i>

834
01:06:55.374 --> 01:06:57.291
How did you get in?

835
01:06:57.457 --> 01:07:00.082
Do you know where Mom and Dad are?

836
01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:16.124
- Mom? Dad?

837
01:07:35.249 --> 01:07:37.332
- How did this happen?

838
01:07:46.749 --> 01:07:50.707
Oh, she's taken them!

839
01:08:29.499 --> 01:08:33.791
They're not coming back,
are they? Mom and Dad?

840
01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:36.291
Not on their own.

841
01:08:37.624 --> 01:08:40.374
Only one thing to do.

842
01:09:10.832 --> 01:09:14.999
- You know you're
walking right into her trap.

843
01:09:15.166 --> 01:09:18.332
- I have to go back.

844
01:09:18.499 --> 01:09:21.957
They are my parents.

845
01:09:22.124 --> 01:09:23.707
- Challenge her then.

846
01:09:23.874 --> 01:09:26.749
She may not play fair,
but she won't refuse.

847
01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:29.832
She's got a thing for games.

848
01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:31.582
- Hmm.

849
01:09:31.749 --> 01:09:33.499
Okay.

850
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:39.999
<i>- Coraline?</i>
- Mom?

851
01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:42.666
- Coraline!
You came back for us!

852
01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:46.916
- Mom!

853
01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:51.666
- Darling, why would
you run away from me?

854
01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:53.832
- Oh!

855
01:09:55.999 --> 01:09:57.707
Where are my parents?

856
01:09:57.874 --> 01:10:01.749
- Gosh, I have no idea
where your old parents are.

857
01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:03.624
Perhaps they've grown bored of you

858
01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:05.124
and run away to France.

859
01:10:05.291 --> 01:10:07.041
- They weren't bored of me.
You stole them!

860
01:10:07.207 --> 01:10:09.624
- Now don't be difficult,
Coraline.

861
01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:13.332
Have a seat, won't you?

862
01:10:32.082 --> 01:10:34.041
- Why don't you have
your own key?

863
01:10:34.207 --> 01:10:37.332
- Only one key.
- Shh!

864
01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:39.624
The garden squash need tending,

865
01:10:39.791 --> 01:10:41.457
don't you think, pumpkin?

866
01:10:41.624 --> 01:10:45.332
- Squish squash,
pumpkin song.

867
01:10:49.124 --> 01:10:51.916
- Mom? Dad?

868
01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:55.457
- Where'd she hide you?

869
01:10:55.624 --> 01:10:58.457
<i>Breakfast time!</i>

870
01:11:03.874 --> 01:11:06.332

877
01:11:29.082 --> 01:11:31.832
- What kind of game
would it be?

878
01:11:31.999 --> 01:11:35.457
- An exploring game.
A finding things game.

879
01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:39.041
- And what is it you'd
be finding, Coraline?

880
01:11:39.207 --> 01:11:40.874

881

882
01:11:43.041 --> 01:11:46.832
- And the eyes of
the ghost children.

883
01:11:46.999 --> 01:11:50.582
- Huh. What if you
don't find them?

884

888
01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:04.999
And if you somehow win this game...?

889
01:12:05.166 --> 01:12:07.999
- Then you let me go.
You let everyone go.

890

My real father and mother,
the dead children.

891
01:12:10.666 --> 01:12:11.874
Everyone you've trapped here.

892
01:12:12.041 --> 01:12:14.707
- Deal.

893
01:12:14.874 --> 01:12:18.791
- Not till you
give me a clue.

894
01:12:18.957 --> 01:12:20.666
- Oh, right.

895
01:12:20.832 --> 01:12:24.666
In each of three wonders
I've made just for you,

896
01:12:24.832 --> 01:12:28.832
a ghost eye is lost in plain sight.

897
01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:32.041
- And for my parents?

898
01:12:35.457 --> 01:12:38.999
Fine. Don't tell me.

899
01:12:41.291 --> 01:12:42.916
It's a deal.

900
01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:54.749
What does she mean, "wonders"?

901
01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:02.291
Hmm.

902
01:13:17.499 --> 01:13:19.082
- Ugh!

903
01:13:32.666 --> 01:13:33.999
No!

904
01:13:54.582 --> 01:13:56.582
- Stop!

905
01:14:13.332 --> 01:14:15.166
Why steal this?

906
01:14:18.124 --> 01:14:21.041
Wow!

907
01:14:27.207 --> 01:14:29.082
That must be it!

908
01:14:33.124 --> 01:14:36.207
- Sorry.

909
01:14:36.374 --> 01:14:38.374
So sorry.

910
01:14:38.541 --> 01:14:41.874
Mother making me.

911
01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:46.166
Don't wanna hurt you!

912
01:14:53.499 --> 01:14:56.624
Take it!

913
01:15:08.999 --> 01:15:11.791
- Bless you, miss!
You found me!

914
01:15:11.957 --> 01:15:13.957
But there's two eyes still lost.

915
01:15:15.499 --> 01:15:16.999
Don't worry.

916
01:15:17.166 --> 01:15:19.166
I'm getting the hang of it.

<i>- Stop! Thief!</i>

01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:40.624
<i>- Oh, Wybie.</i>

936
01:17:40.791 --> 01:17:42.749
Evil witch!

937
01:17:42.916 --> 01:17:44.999
I'm not scared!

938
01:18:01.249 --> 01:18:05.499
Hello... <i>golubushka.</i>

939
01:18:05.666 --> 01:18:08.166
- I'm Coraline.

940
01:18:08.332 --> 01:18:13.666
- Is this what
you're looking for?

941
01:18:13.832 --> 01:18:15.624
- Uh-huh.

942
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.999
- You think winning game
is good thing?

943
01:18:22.499 --> 01:18:26.916
<i>You'll just go home, and be bored
and neglected.</i>

944
01:18:27.082 --> 01:18:29.666
Same as always.

945
01:18:29.832 --> 01:18:32.624
Stay here with us.

946
01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:37.666
We will listen to you and laugh with you.

947
01:18:46.416 --> 01:18:48.749
If you stay here,

948
01:18:48.916 --> 01:18:51.999
you could have whatever you want...

949
01:18:52.166 --> 01:18:55.207
...always.

950
01:18:55.374 --> 01:18:57.082
- You don't get it,
do you?

951
01:18:57.249 --> 01:19:00.166
- I don't understand.

952
01:19:00.332 --> 01:19:02.749
- Of course,
you don't understand.

953
01:19:02.916 --> 01:19:05.166
You're just a copy
she made of the real Mr. B.

954
01:19:05.332 --> 01:19:08.457
- Not even that...

955
01:19:08.624 --> 01:19:10.249
anymore.

956
01:19:25.541 --> 01:19:26.916
No!

957
01:19:34.499 --> 01:19:35.999
No!

958
01:19:41.416 --> 01:19:43.666
No!

959
01:20:04.999 --> 01:20:08.291
Oh, God, I've lost the game.

960
01:20:08.457 --> 01:20:11.041
I've lost everything.

961
01:20:20.416 --> 01:20:22.041
- I think I mentioned

962
01:20:22.207 --> 01:20:24.499
that I don't like rats
at the best of times.

963
01:20:26.499 --> 01:20:29.291
- I think you might have said
something like that.

964
01:20:29.457 --> 01:20:32.416
- It looked like you
needed this one, however.

965
01:20:33.999 --> 01:20:35.291
- Thank you.

966
01:20:40.832 --> 01:20:42.582
I'm heading inside.

967
01:20:42.749 --> 01:20:44.541
I still have to find my parents.

968
01:21:09.832 --> 01:21:11.791
Come on! Quickly!

969
01:21:55.082 --> 01:21:58.666
- So, you're back.

970
01:21:58.832 --> 01:22:01.332
And you brought vermin with you?

971
01:22:01.499 --> 01:22:05.916
No. I--

972
01:22:06.082 --> 01:22:08.291
I brought a friend.

973
01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:12.041
- You know I love you.

974
01:22:13.791 --> 01:22:16.207
Mm...

975
01:22:16.374 --> 01:22:20.041
- You have a very funny way
of showing it.

976
01:22:21.374 --> 01:22:23.832
- So where are they--

977
01:22:23.999 --> 01:22:26.166
The ghost eyes?

978
01:22:31.082 --> 01:22:33.082
- Hold on.

979
01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:36.291
We aren't finished yet, are we?

980
01:22:36.457 --> 01:22:38.832
- No, I suppose not.

981
01:22:38.999 --> 01:22:41.166
After all, you still need to find

982
01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:44.666
your old parents, don't you?

983
01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:49.499
Too bad you won't have this.

984
01:23:00.624 --> 01:23:01.791
- Be clever, miss.

985
01:23:01.957 --> 01:23:05.499
Even if you win, she'll never let you go!

986
01:23:12.916 --> 01:23:15.082
- I already know where
you've hidden them.

987
01:23:15.249 --> 01:23:17.499
- Mmm.

988
01:23:17.666 --> 01:23:21.666
Well, produce them.

989
01:23:21.832 --> 01:23:23.957
- They're behind that door.

990
01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:27.499
- Oh, they are, are they?

991
01:23:38.166 --> 01:23:40.666
There.

992
01:23:41.832 --> 01:23:44.249
- Mom? Dad?

993
01:23:49.082 --> 01:23:51.749
- Go on! Open it.

994
01:23:51.916 --> 01:23:53.999
They'll be there, all right.

995
01:23:55.249 --> 01:23:58.791
- You're wrong, Coraline.

996
01:23:58.957 --> 01:24:02.166
They aren't there.

997
01:24:02.332 --> 01:24:07.666
Now you're going to stay here forever.

998
01:24:07.832 --> 01:24:11.457
- No... I'm... <i>not!</i>

999
01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:23.166
- No!

1000
01:24:28.666 --> 01:24:30.999
You horrible cheating girl!

1001
01:24:49.499 --> 01:24:50.666
- No!

1002
01:24:50.832 --> 01:24:53.332
Where are you?

1003
01:24:53.499 --> 01:24:56.124
You selfish brat!

1004
01:25:13.082 --> 01:25:16.791
You dare disobey your <i>mother?</i>

1005
01:25:16.957 --> 01:25:18.166
- Oh!

1006
01:25:22.332 --> 01:25:23.874
Please shut!

1007
01:25:39.332 --> 01:25:42.707
<i>Don't leave me! Don't leave me!</i>

1008
01:25:42.874 --> 01:25:45.291
<i>I'll die without you!</i>

1009
01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:52.291
- Ah!

1010
01:26:16.582 --> 01:26:18.791
- Coraline, we're home!

1011
01:26:18.957 --> 01:26:21.291
- Mom? Dad?
I missed you so much!

1012
01:26:21.457 --> 01:26:23.124
- Missed us?

1013
01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:25.416
Oh, no, you broke my favorite snow globe.

1014
01:26:25.582 --> 01:26:27.166
- I didn't break it.

1015
01:26:27.332 --> 01:26:28.874
It must have broke when you escaped!

1016
01:26:29.041 --> 01:26:30.082
- And cut your knee.

1017
01:26:30.249 --> 01:26:32.666
- Coraline, I asked you
to count all the windows,

1018
01:26:32.832 --> 01:26:34.207
not put your knee through them.

1019
01:26:34.374 --> 01:26:35.374
- But...

1020
01:26:35.541 --> 01:26:38.666
- Well, get yourself cleaned up.
We're going out tonight.

1021
01:26:38.832 --> 01:26:40.624
- We got a lot
to celebrate.

1022
01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:44.207
- You're talking about
your garden catalog?

1023
01:26:44.374 --> 01:26:47.041
- Of course.
What else?

1024
01:26:47.207 --> 01:26:49.707
<i>- But look at the snow
on your clothes.</i>

1025
01:26:49.874 --> 01:26:52.499
- What's gotten
into you, Coraline?

1026
01:27:02.707 --> 01:27:05.624
Oh! Oh!

1027
01:27:07.499 --> 01:27:09.249
So gonna order the tulips?

1028
01:27:09.416 --> 01:27:11.791
- What's that?
- For the garden party?

1029
01:27:11.957 --> 01:27:14.332
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1030
01:27:14.499 --> 01:27:16.457
- Dad!

1031
01:27:16.624 --> 01:27:18.082
So, Mom, invitations?

1032
01:27:18.249 --> 01:27:19.999
<i>Don't forget the invitations.</i>

1033
01:27:20.166 --> 01:27:21.374
- Even Bob in sky?

1034
01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.582
- Mr. B's not drunk, Mom.

1035
01:27:23.749 --> 01:27:26.166
He's just eccentric.

1036
01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:29.666
- Good night, Coraline.

1037
01:27:48.916 --> 01:27:52.207
- Oh, hello again.

1038
01:27:53.374 --> 01:27:55.541
You still mad?

1039
01:27:55.707 --> 01:27:58.541
I'm really sorry I threw you at her--

1040
01:27:58.707 --> 01:28:00.541
The Other Mother.

1041
01:28:00.707 --> 01:28:03.207
It was all I could think of.

1042
01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:20.166
I think it's time, don't you?

1043
01:28:20.332 --> 01:28:22.457
To set them free?

1044
01:28:45.249 --> 01:28:48.624
- It's a fine, fine thing
you did for us, miss.

1045
01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:53.832
- Well, I'm glad
it's finally over.

1046
01:28:53.999 --> 01:28:56.832
- It is over and done with...
for us.

1047
01:28:56.999 --> 01:28:58.457
- What about me?

1048
01:28:58.624 --> 01:29:01.166
- You're in terrible
danger, girl!

1049
01:29:01.332 --> 01:29:03.832
- But how?
I locked the door!

1050
01:29:03.999 --> 01:29:06.416
- It's the key, miss.
There's only one,

1051
01:29:06.582 --> 01:29:09.582
<i>and the Beldam will find it.</i>

1052
01:29:09.749 --> 01:29:12.041
- 'Tain't all bad, miss.

1053
01:29:12.207 --> 01:29:17.249
Thou art alive. Thou art still living.

1054
01:29:28.041 --> 01:29:29.499
- I gotta hide this
somewhere.

1055
01:29:29.666 --> 01:29:31.916
Somewhere she can never--

1056
01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:41.041
- Out of my way!

1057
01:29:56.374 --> 01:29:59.707
- "Oh, my twitchy
witchy girl,

1058
01:29:59.874 --> 01:30:01.832
I think you are so nice.

1059
01:30:01.999 --> 01:30:03.541
I give you bowls of porridge,

1060
01:30:03.707 --> 01:30:07.166
and I give you bowls of ice... cream.

1061
01:30:08.499 --> 01:30:10.999
I give you lots of kisses...

1062
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:15.791
<i>- ...and I give you
lots of hugs.</i>

1063
01:30:15.957 --> 01:30:18.082
But I never give you sandwiches

1064
01:30:18.249 --> 01:30:23.541
with grease and worms and mung... beans."

1065
01:30:46.332 --> 01:30:47.582
- Yah!

1066
01:31:06.374 --> 01:31:07.416
Oh-hh!

1067
01:31:07.582 --> 01:31:08.791
Get off!

1068
01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:55.957
- I'm really sorry
I didn't believe you

1069
01:31:56.124 --> 01:32:00.749
about all this evil stuff, Coraline.

1070
01:32:00.916 --> 01:32:03.124
- Why did you change
your mind?

1071
01:32:03.291 --> 01:32:05.082
- Well, Grandma showed me
this picture...

1072
01:32:05.249 --> 01:32:08.957
after I called you crazy.

1073
01:32:09.124 --> 01:32:12.124
It's her and her sister
before she disappeared.

1074
01:32:12.291 --> 01:32:13.707
- The sweet ghost girl.

1075
01:32:13.874 --> 01:32:17.582
<i>Wyborne! Come home!</i>

1076
01:32:17.749 --> 01:32:19.957
Oh, man.

1077
01:32:20.124 --> 01:32:21.332
What am I gonna tell her?

1078
01:32:21.499 --> 01:32:24.999
- Just bring her
by the house tomorrow.

1079
01:32:25.166 --> 01:32:27.457
We can tell her together.

1080
01:32:27.624 --> 01:32:29.624
- We-- we can?

1081
01:32:29.791 --> 01:32:33.207
- You know, I'm glad
you decided to stalk me.

1082
01:32:34.624 --> 01:32:36.374
- It wasn't my idea.

1083
01:33:02.416 --> 01:33:05.499
<i>- Thanks for helping me,
Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.</i>

1084
01:33:05.666 --> 01:33:08.791
- Oh, look, April,
Pink Ladies!

1085
01:33:08.957 --> 01:33:11.041
- Actually,
it's just lemonade.

1086
01:33:11.207 --> 01:33:12.749
How's Angus doing?

1087
01:33:12.916 --> 01:33:14.624
- Oh, much better, dear.

1088
01:33:14.791 --> 01:33:18.166
But he can't duck his wings forever.

1089
01:33:18.332 --> 01:33:19.791
<i>Here comes a burp.</i>

1090
01:33:19.957 --> 01:33:21.541
- Charlie!

1091
01:33:21.707 --> 01:33:25.624
- Oh, <i>excusez-moi,</i> but
that pizza was delicious.

1092
01:33:25.791 --> 01:33:28.124
<i>- Cold drinks?</i>
- Oh, yeah, great.

1093
01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:31.582
- You were right, Coraline.
I really hate dirt!

1094
01:33:31.749 --> 01:33:34.624
But the tulips look nice.

1095
01:33:34.791 --> 01:33:38.457
<i>- Thanks, Mom.</i>

1096
01:33:38.624 --> 01:33:40.832
<i>Nyet, nyet.</i>

1097
01:33:40.999 --> 01:33:43.207
<i>Da, da,</i> that is possible--

1098
01:33:43.374 --> 01:33:45.666
<i>- Ahem!</i>

1099
01:33:45.832 --> 01:33:47.832
<i>How are the mooshkas, Mr. B?</i>

1100
01:33:47.999 --> 01:33:51.624
- They tell me that you
are savior, Caroline.

1101
01:33:51.791 --> 01:33:53.291
And soon as they are ready,

1102
01:33:53.457 --> 01:33:56.749
they wish to give special
"thanks you" performance.

1103
01:33:56.916 --> 01:34:01.166
- Wyborne, I know
where I'm goin'.

1104
01:34:01.332 --> 01:34:02.457
I grew up here.

1105
01:34:02.624 --> 01:34:04.749
<i>- Welcome, Ms. Lovat!</i>

1106
01:34:04.916 --> 01:34:07.416
- Oh, hello.

1107
01:34:08.832 --> 01:34:10.957
- I'm Coraline Jones.

1108
01:34:11.124 --> 01:34:13.124
I've got so much to tell you!

1109
01:34:13.291 --> 01:34:14.957
- Here.
- Thanks.

1110
01:34:15.124 --> 01:34:17.457
<i>Do you want to pop
a little gin in it, dear?</i>

1111
01:34:17.624 --> 01:34:19.457
<i>Of course.</i>
