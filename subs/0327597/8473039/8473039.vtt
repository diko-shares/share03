29
00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:03.311
- You scared me to death,
you mangy thing!

30
00:05:03.478 --> 00:05:05.811
I'm just lookin' for an old well.

31
00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:07.103
Know it?

32
00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:11.437
Not talkin', huh?

33
00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:16.145
Magic dowser, magic dowser.

34
00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:20.020
Show me the well!

35
00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:24.353

[screams] Get away from me!

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:36.020
[thunder crackles]

39
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.228
- Ooh, let me guess.
You're from Texas or Utah.

40
00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:46.811
Someplace dried out and barren, right?

41
00:05:46.978 --> 00:05:49.019
I heard about water-witching before.

42
00:05:49.187 --> 00:05:50.645
But it doesn't make sense.

43
00:05:50.812 --> 00:05:52.562
I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.

44
00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.353
- It's a dowsing rod!

45
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.686
- Ow!

46
00:05:55.853 --> 00:05:57.311
- And I don't like
being stalked!

47
00:05:57.478 --> 00:06:00.228
Not by psycho nerds or their cats!

48
00:06:00.395 --> 00:06:02.395
- He's not really my cat.
He's kind of feral.

49
00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:03.812
You know, wild?

50
00:06:03.978 --> 00:06:05.894
Of course, I do feed him every night.

51
00:06:06.062 --> 00:06:07.645
And sometimes he'll come to my window

52
00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:09.728
and bring me little dead things.

53
00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:12.395
- Look, I'm from Pontiac.

54
00:06:12.562 --> 00:06:15.020
- Huh?
- Michigan?

55
00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:19.395
And if I'm a water witch,
then where's the secret well?

56
00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:22.187
- You stomp too hard,
and you'll fall in it.

57
00:06:22.353 --> 00:06:23.811
- Oh!

58
00:06:26.145 --> 00:06:28.436
- See?
- [thumping echoes]

59
00:06:28.603 --> 00:06:29.853
It's supposed to be so deep,

60
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.728
if you fell to the bottom and looked up,

61
00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:34.978
you'd see a sky full of stars
in the middle of the day.

62
00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:37.728
- Huh.

63
00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.895
- Surprised
she let you move in.

64
00:06:40.062 --> 00:06:42.645
My grandma? She owns the Pink Palace.

65
00:06:42.812 --> 00:06:44.270
Won't rent to people with kids.

66
00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:45.853
- What do you mean?

67
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.728
- Oh, I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

68
00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:51.478
I'm Wybie. Wybie Lovat.

69
00:06:51.645 --> 00:06:53.603
- "Wybie"?
- Short for "Wyborne."

70
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.811
Not my idea, of course.

71
00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:57.519
What'd you get saddled with?

72
00:06:57.687 --> 00:06:58.978
- I wasn't "saddled”
with anything.

73
00:06:59.145 --> 00:07:01.853
It's Coraline.
- Caroline what?

74
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.978
- Coraline.
Coraline Jones.

75
00:07:04.145 --> 00:07:06.145
- Hmm.
It's not real scientific,

76
00:07:06.312 --> 00:07:08.395
but I heard an ordinary name like Caroline

77
00:07:08.562 --> 00:07:10.853
can lead people to have ordinary
expectations about a person.

78
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.228
- [grumbles]
- Wyborne?

79
00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:17.145
- I think I heard someone
calling you, Wyborne.

80
00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.520
- What?
I didn't hear anything.

81
00:07:20.687 --> 00:07:24.353
- Oh, I definitely heard
someone, "Why-were-you-borne."

82
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.478
- Wyborne!
- [bell ringing]

83
00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:27.895
- Grandma!

84
00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:29.770
[chuckles]

85
00:07:31.395 --> 00:07:34.311
- Well, great to meet
a Michigan water witch.

86
00:07:35.645 --> 00:07:38.353
But I'd wear gloves next time.

87
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.228
- Why?

88
00:07:40.395 --> 00:07:43.686
- 'Cause that dowsing rod
of yours, it's poison oak.

89
00:07:43.853 --> 00:07:45.478
[gasps]

90
00:07:49.853 --> 00:07:51.853
[blows raspberry]

91
00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:11.145
[faint splash]

92
00:08:15.187 --> 00:08:18.103
- I almost fell down
a well yesterday, Mom.

93
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.353
- Uh-huh.

94
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.728
- I would have died.

95
00:08:21.895 --> 00:08:23.603
- That's nice.

96
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.520
- Hmm.
So can I go out?

97
00:08:26.687 --> 00:08:28.770
I think it's perfect weather
for gardening.

98
00:08:28.937 --> 00:08:30.937
- No, Coraline.
Rain makes mud.

99
00:08:31.103 --> 00:08:32.728
Mud makes a mess.

100
00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:36.061
- Mom, I want stuff growing
when my friends come to visit.

101
00:08:36.228 --> 00:08:37.769
Isn't that why we moved here?

102
00:08:37.937 --> 00:08:39.645
- Something like that.

103
00:08:39.812 --> 00:08:41.978
But then we had the accident.

104
00:08:42.145 --> 00:08:43.978
- It wasn't my fault
you hit that truck!

105
00:08:44.145 --> 00:08:45.228
- I never said it was.

106
00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:46.811
- I can't believe it.

107
00:08:46.978 --> 00:08:48.978
You and Dad get paid to write about plants

108
00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:50.478
and you hate dirt.

109
00:08:50.645 --> 00:08:53.270
- Coraline, I don't have
time for you right now.

110
00:08:53.437 --> 00:08:54.853
And you still have unpacking to do.

111
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.978
Lots of unpacking!

112
00:08:57.145 --> 00:09:00.103
- That sounds exciting.

113
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.770
- Oh, some kid left this
on the front porch.

114
00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:06.603
- [Wybie's voice] "Hey, Jonesy.

115
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:08.353
Look what I found in Grandma's trunk.

116
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.811
Look familiar? Wybie."

117
00:09:10.978 --> 00:09:13.644
[groans]

118
00:09:13.812 --> 00:09:14.853
- Huh.

119
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.061
A little me? That's weird.

120
00:09:19.228 --> 00:09:20.853
- What's his name anyway?

121
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.645
- Wybie. I'm way too old
for dolls.

122
00:09:28.353 --> 00:09:31.311
Hey, Dad. How's the writing going?

123
00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:36.811
Dad!

124
00:09:36.978 --> 00:09:38.186
- Hello, Coraline.

125
00:09:38.353 --> 00:09:41.561
And Coraline... doll?

126
00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:44.770
- Do you know where
the garden tools are?

127
00:09:44.937 --> 00:09:48.520
- It's pouring
out there, isn't it?

128
00:09:48.687 --> 00:09:51.312
- Hmm.
It's just raining.

129
00:09:51.478 --> 00:09:53.311
- Hmm, what'd
"the boss" say?

130
00:09:53.478 --> 00:09:56.686
- "Don't even think about
going out, Coraline Jones!"

131
00:09:56.853 --> 00:09:58.644
- Then you won't need
the tools.

132
00:09:58.812 --> 00:10:00.437
- Oh...

133
00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:05.061
[door squeaks]

134
00:10:09.312 --> 00:10:10.520
- Oh!

135
00:10:10.687 --> 00:10:14.145
You know, this house is 150 years old.

136
00:10:14.312 --> 00:10:17.145
-So?
- So explore it.

137
00:10:17.312 --> 00:10:19.978
Go out and count all the doors and windows

138
00:10:20.145 --> 00:10:22.853
and write that down,
or list everything that's blue.

139
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.353
Just let me work!

140
00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:29.812
- [sighs]
- [keyboard clicking]

141
00:11:02.187 --> 00:11:03.353
- Ugh!

142
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.561
Agh!

143
00:11:07.312 --> 00:11:08.978
Oh, ugh!

144
00:11:10.228 --> 00:11:11.978
[squeaks]

145
00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:15.062
Ah!

146
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.686
[door squeaks]

147
00:11:33.353 --> 00:11:34.686
[crackling]

148
00:11:34.853 --> 00:11:37.769

No, no! No!

[screams]

150
00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:17.937
- One boring blue boy

151
00:12:18.103 --> 00:12:21.519
in a painfully boring painting.

152
00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:26.812
Four incredibly boring windows.

153
00:12:26.978 --> 00:12:30.644
And no more doors.

154
00:12:33.478 --> 00:12:36.853
All right, little me.
Where are you hiding?

155
00:12:45.437 --> 00:12:46.812
Huh?

156
00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:53.644
Hey, Mom! Where does this door go?

157
00:12:53.812 --> 00:12:56.103
- I'm really, really busy!

158
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.978
- I think it's locked!

159
00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:02.686
Please?
- [groans]

160
00:13:10.353 --> 00:13:14.103
- Will you stop pestering me
if I do this for you?

161
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.186
[whimpers]

162
00:13:16.353 --> 00:13:18.019
- Fine!

00:13:23.145 --> 00:13:25.228
[ripping]

164
00:13:34.645 --> 00:13:37.103
- Bricks?
I don't get it!

165
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.978
- They must have closed
this off

166
00:13:39.145 --> 00:13:40.645
when they divided up the house.

167
00:13:40.812 --> 00:13:43.562
- You're kidding.
And why is the door so small?

168
00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:46.103
- We made a deal.

169
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.770
Zip it!

170
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.145
- You didn't lock it.

[crackling]

339
00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.520
Very clever, using this mix-up

340
00:24:43.687 --> 00:24:46.645
to sneak in my home and peek at mooshkas.

341
00:24:46.812 --> 00:24:49.103
- "Mooshkas"?
- The mice!

342
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.811
- Oh, sorry.

343
00:24:51.978 --> 00:24:54.103
I'm Coraline Jones.

-And I am
the Amazing Bobinsky.

00:24:59.687 --> 00:25:01.812
But you call me Mr. B.

346
00:25:01.978 --> 00:25:06.478
Because amazing, I already know that I am.

347
00:25:06.853 --> 00:25:08.769
- Wha...?

348
00:25:12.312 --> 00:25:14.562
- Ha!
You see, Caroline?

349
00:25:14.728 --> 00:25:18.769
The problem is my new songs
go "Oompah, oompah."

350
00:25:18.937 --> 00:25:22.812
But the jumping mice play
only "Toodle-toot," like that.

351
00:25:22.978 --> 00:25:26.478
It's nice, but not so much amazing.

352
00:25:26.645 --> 00:25:29.228
So now I switch to stronger cheese,

353
00:25:29.395 --> 00:25:31.020

363
00:26:04.312 --> 00:26:07.353
The mice asked me to give you message.

364
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.686
- The jumping mice?

365
00:26:09.853 --> 00:26:12.311
- They are saying,

366
00:26:12.478 --> 00:26:14.394
"Do not go through little door."

367
00:26:14.562 --> 00:26:15.728
[gasps]

368
00:26:15.895 --> 00:26:17.311
Do you know such a thing?

369
00:26:17.478 --> 00:26:19.811
- The one
behind the wallpaper?

370
00:26:19.978 --> 00:26:23.311
But it's all bricked up.

371
00:26:23.478 --> 00:26:26.769
- Bah. So sorry.
Is nothing.

372
00:26:26.937 --> 00:26:30.145
Sometimes the mice are
a little mixed up, hmm?

373
00:26:32.728 --> 00:26:35.186
They even get your name wrong, you know?

374
00:26:35.353 --> 00:26:38.019
They call you "Coraline"
instead of "Caroline."

375
00:26:38.187 --> 00:26:40.312
Not Caroline at all!

376
00:26:40.478 --> 00:26:42.644
Maybe I work them too hard.

377
00:26:42.812 --> 00:26:44.437
[shape]

378
00:27:06.728 --> 00:27:08.061
[knocking]

379
00:27:14.978 --> 00:27:17.561
- [barking]
- [gasps]

380
00:27:20.645 --> 00:27:24.228
- Oh, cease
your infernal yapping!

381
00:27:24.395 --> 00:27:26.853
Oh, how nice to see you, Caroline.

382
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.478
Would you like to come in?

383
00:27:28.645 --> 00:27:29.853
We're playing cards.

384
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.853
- Still Coraline,
Miss Spink.

385
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.436
- Miriam!
Put the kettle on!

386
00:27:45.603 --> 00:27:48.019
- April, I think
you're being followed!

387
00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:50.895
- It's the new
neighbor, Miriam.

388
00:27:51.062 --> 00:27:52.812
Caroline.

389
00:27:52.978 --> 00:27:55.103
She'll be having the oolong tea.

390
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:58.561
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'm sure she'd prefer jasmine.

391
00:27:58.728 --> 00:28:00.728
- No, oolong.

392
00:28:00.895 --> 00:28:03.103
- Ah, jasmine it is, then.

393
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.478
[sighs]

394
00:28:06.937 --> 00:28:08.895
- Come on, boys!

395
00:28:16.478 --> 00:28:18.644
- Are those dogs real?

396
00:28:18.812 --> 00:28:22.228
- Our sweet departed angels.

397
00:28:22.395 --> 00:28:24.353
Couldn't bear to part with them.

398
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.728
So we had them stuffed.

399
00:28:26.895 --> 00:28:29.061
Now there's Hamish the Third...

400
00:28:29.228 --> 00:28:31.394
- Oh, go on.
Have one.

401
00:28:31.562 --> 00:28:34.687
It's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton.

402
00:28:34.853 --> 00:28:36.644
Best in the world.

403
00:28:36.812 --> 00:28:38.062
- ...the Third, the Ninth?

404
00:28:38.228 --> 00:28:39.728
Yes, the Fourth, I'm right--

405
00:28:39.895 --> 00:28:41.395
And Jock Jr. Jock Sr.,

406
00:28:41.562 --> 00:28:43.270
Jock the Third, the Fourth--

407
00:28:43.437 --> 00:28:46.603
Oh, and that's Jock's
cousin twice removed.

408
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.395
I'll read them if you like.

409
00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:51.769
- Read what?

410
00:28:51.937 --> 00:28:53.603
- Oh, your tea leaves, dear.

411
00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.853
They'll tell me your future.

412
00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:59.561
Drink up, then. Go on.

413
00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:01.144
No, not all of it, not all of it.

414
00:29:01.312 --> 00:29:03.478
That's right. Now hand it over.

415
00:29:06.853 --> 00:29:08.936
Oh...

416
00:29:09.103 --> 00:29:10.436
oh, Caroline.

417
00:29:10.603 --> 00:29:12.769
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.

418
00:29:12.937 --> 00:29:16.645
You are in terrible danger.

419
00:29:16.812 --> 00:29:18.812
- Oh, give me
that cup, April.

420
00:29:18.978 --> 00:29:20.311
Your eyes are going.

421
00:29:20.478 --> 00:29:23.394
- My eyes?
You're blind as a bat!

422
00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:27.062
- Oh, now.
Well, not to worry, child.

423
00:29:27.228 --> 00:29:29.186
It's good news.

424
00:29:29.353 --> 00:29:33.019
There's a tall handsome
beast in your future.

425
00:29:33.187 --> 00:29:34.562
- A what?

426
00:29:34.728 --> 00:29:38.311
- Miriam, really.
You're holding it wrong.

427
00:29:38.478 --> 00:29:40.603
See? Danger.

428
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:41.770
- What do you see?

429
00:29:41.937 --> 00:29:45.020
- I see a very peculiar hand.

430
00:29:45.187 --> 00:29:47.312
- I see a giraffe.

431
00:29:47.478 --> 00:29:50.644
- Giraffes don't just fall
from the sky, Miriam!

432
00:29:50.812 --> 00:29:52.187
- [crashes]
- Oh, Lord!

433
00:29:52.353 --> 00:29:55.103
- Well, what should I do?

434
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.645
- Never wear green
in your dressing room.

435
00:29:57.812 --> 00:30:00.478
- Acquire a very tall
stepladder.

436
00:30:00.645 --> 00:30:03.020
And be very, very careful.

437
00:30:03.187 --> 00:30:05.103
Oh!

438
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.270
Now was there something
you came to tell us?

439
00:30:09.978 --> 00:30:12.728
- No. I guess not.
Thanks for the tea, though.

440
00:30:12.895 --> 00:30:15.103
- [Miriam] Toodle-oo.
- [April] Cheery-bye.

441
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.311
Do you have any nice Queens for Mummy?

442
00:30:17.478 --> 00:30:18.478
[dog whimpers]

443
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.436
- Danger?

444
00:30:29.978 --> 00:30:32.269
[clicks]

445
00:30:42.353 --> 00:30:43.353
- Oh!

446
00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.645
- Great!
The village stalker!

447
00:30:44.812 --> 00:30:47.478
- Ow!
I wasn't stalking you.

448
00:30:47.645 --> 00:30:49.645
We're hunting banana slugs.

449
00:30:49.812 --> 00:30:50.937
- What do you mean, we?

450
00:30:51.103 --> 00:30:53.644
[cat meows]

451
00:30:53.812 --> 00:30:57.437
- Ha! Your cat's not wild!
He's a wuss puss!

452
00:30:57.603 --> 00:30:58.894
- What?

453
00:30:59.062 --> 00:31:00.978
He hates to get his feet wet. Jeez!

454
00:31:01.145 --> 00:31:02.936
- Wuss puss.

455
00:31:06.395 --> 00:31:10.353
So that doll, did you
make it look like me?

456
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.520
- Oh, no!

457
00:31:11.687 --> 00:31:13.562
I found it that way.

458
00:31:13.728 --> 00:31:15.144
It's older than Grandma.

459
00:31:15.312 --> 00:31:17.478
Old as this house, probably.

460
00:31:17.645 --> 00:31:19.186
- Come on. Blue hair,

461
00:31:19.353 --> 00:31:21.103
my swampers and raincoat?

462
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.228
- Hey!
Check out "Slugzilla!"

463
00:31:25.728 --> 00:31:27.728
- You're just like them.

464
00:31:28.937 --> 00:31:29.937
- Huh?

465
00:31:30.103 --> 00:31:31.478
- I meant my parents.

466
00:31:31.645 --> 00:31:33.145
They don't listen to me either.

467
00:31:33.312 --> 00:31:35.228
- Mm-hmm.
Do you mind?

468
00:31:37.353 --> 00:31:39.978
Nom, nom... [moans]

469
00:31:40.145 --> 00:31:41.353
[screams]

470
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:44.270
Hmm...
- Ew!

471
00:31:44.437 --> 00:31:45.437
[laughs]

472
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.645
- You know, I've never been
inside the Pink Palace.

473
00:31:53.812 --> 00:31:55.978
- You're kidding.

474
00:31:56.145 --> 00:31:57.478
- Grandma'd kill me.

475
00:31:57.645 --> 00:31:59.770
Thinks it's dangerous or something.

476
00:31:59.937 --> 00:32:01.687
- Dangerous?

477
00:32:01.853 --> 00:32:04.686
- Well, she had
a twin sister.

478
00:32:04.853 --> 00:32:06.603
-So?

479
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:09.228
- When they were kids,
Grandma's sister disappeared.

480
00:32:09.395 --> 00:32:12.061
She says she was stolen.

481
00:32:12.228 --> 00:32:14.103
- Stolen?
- [meows]

482
00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.978
Well, what do you think?

483
00:32:17.145 --> 00:32:20.311
- Uh, I don't know.
Maybe she just ran away.

484
00:32:20.478 --> 00:32:23.103
- Wyborne!
- [bell ringing]

485
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.853
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait a minute!

486
00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:29.311
Hmm.

487
00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.478
[mouse squeaks]

488
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.811
[squeaks]

489
00:33:15.687 --> 00:33:17.437
[squeaking]

490
00:33:35.853 --> 00:33:37.811
[Other Mother humming]

491
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.645
- Welcome back, darling.

492
00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:44.437
- Hi.

493
00:33:44.603 --> 00:33:47.228
- So thoughtful of you to send
this nice cheddar, Coraline.

494
00:33:47.395 --> 00:33:48.728
- Cheddar?

495
00:33:48.895 --> 00:33:51.853
Oh! The mice bait.

496
00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.811
- Would you go
fetch your father?

497
00:33:53.978 --> 00:33:56.186
I bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.

498
00:33:56.353 --> 00:33:59.061
- You mean,
my Other Father?

499
00:33:59.228 --> 00:34:01.811
- Your better father, dear.
He's out in the garden.

500
00:34:01.978 --> 00:34:04.228
- But my parents
don't have time to garden.

501
00:34:04.395 --> 00:34:05.895
- Shh! Shh!

502
00:34:06.062 --> 00:34:07.520
- Mmm.

503
00:34:07.687 --> 00:34:09.103
- Go on.

504
00:34:30.853 --> 00:34:32.353
[gasps]

505
00:34:39.478 --> 00:34:40.644
Oh!
- [croaks]

506
00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.145
- [laughs]

507
00:35:00.228 --> 00:35:02.853
- Hey!

508
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.895
- I love your garden!

509
00:35:05.062 --> 00:35:07.562
- Our garden, Coraline.

510
00:35:10.853 --> 00:35:13.394
- [giggles] Stop tickling me!

511
00:35:15.062 --> 00:35:18.478
- Oh, daughter in distress.

512
00:35:18.645 --> 00:35:19.936
[tooting]

513
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.728
- Tickle no more,
you dragonsnappers.

514
00:35:36.478 --> 00:35:38.519
- Well, she said
it's time for dinner.

515
00:35:38.687 --> 00:35:41.103
Breakfast? Food?

516
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:44.270
- Hop on, kiddo.
I wanna show you something.

517
00:35:54.645 --> 00:35:56.811
- I can't believe
you did this!

518
00:35:56.978 --> 00:35:58.728
- Mother said you'd like it.

519
00:35:58.895 --> 00:36:01.811
For she knows you like
the back of her hand.

520
00:36:05.645 --> 00:36:07.186
- Mmm, so good.

521
00:36:07.353 --> 00:36:09.644
- I love dinner
breakfast food.

522
00:36:09.812 --> 00:36:12.478
- Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky
has invited you

523
00:36:12.645 --> 00:36:14.728
to come see the jumping mice
perform after dinner.

524
00:36:14.895 --> 00:36:17.520
- Really?
That know-it-all Wybie said

525
00:36:17.687 --> 00:36:20.478
it was all in Mr. B's head.
I knew he was wrong.

526
00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.978
- Well, everything's right
in this world, kiddo.

527
00:36:23.145 --> 00:36:24.645
- Your father and I
will clean up

528
00:36:24.812 --> 00:36:28.312
while you and your "friend"” head upstairs.

529
00:36:28.478 --> 00:36:30.186
- My friend?

530
00:36:32.312 --> 00:36:34.645
Great. Another Wybie.

531
00:36:34.812 --> 00:36:38.020
Hello, "Why-were-you-borne."

532
00:36:38.187 --> 00:36:40.645
Hello?

533
00:36:40.812 --> 00:36:44.145
- I thought you'd like him more
if he spoke a little less.

534
00:36:44.312 --> 00:36:45.770
So I fixed him.

535
00:36:45.937 --> 00:36:48.645
- So he can't talk at all?

536
00:36:48.812 --> 00:36:50.728
- Nope.
- Hmm.

537
00:36:50.895 --> 00:36:52.478
I like it.

538
00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:55.603
- Now run along, you two,
and have fun.

539
00:36:58.603 --> 00:36:59.978
- You're awful cheerful,

540
00:37:00.145 --> 00:37:03.978
considering you can't say anything.

541

00:49:56.603 --> 00:50:01.103
- "In apprehension,
how like a god."

722
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.770
[screams]

723
00:50:02.937 --> 00:50:04.978
- "The beauty of the world."

724
00:50:05.145 --> 00:50:07.770
- [laughs]

725
00:50:07.937 --> 00:50:10.937
- "The paragon of animals.”

726
00:50:14.437 --> 00:50:16.228
- Yeah!

727
00:50:26.728 --> 00:50:28.603
[screams]

728
00:50:33.395 --> 00:50:34.520
[laughs]

729
00:50:34.687 --> 00:50:36.187
[barking]

730
00:50:49.853 --> 00:50:51.728
- Hey, there.

731
00:50:51.895 --> 00:50:53.811
- Was it wonderful, dear?

732
00:50:53.978 --> 00:50:55.519
- Oh, yeah.
They swooped down

733
00:50:55.687 --> 00:50:57.853
and pulled me right out of
my seat, Spink and Forcible.

734
00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:00.895
Only they weren't old ladies.
That was just a disguise.

735
00:51:01.062 --> 00:51:03.103
But then I was flying through the air.

736
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.270
And it was...

737
00:51:04.437 --> 00:51:05.562
Oh, it was magic.

738
00:51:05.728 --> 00:51:07.894
- You do like it here,
don't you, Coraline?

739
00:51:08.062 --> 00:51:09.312
- Uh-huh.

740
00:51:09.478 --> 00:51:10.686
Good night, Wybie.

741
00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.603
- You could stay here
forever, if you want to.

742
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:25.936
- Really?

743
00:51:26.103 --> 00:51:28.228
- Sure.
We'll sing and play games.

744
00:51:28.395 --> 00:51:30.270
And Mother will cook your favorite meals.

745
00:51:30.437 --> 00:51:33.020
- There's one tiny little
thing we need to do.

746
00:51:33.187 --> 00:51:34.187
- What's that?

747
00:51:34.353 --> 00:51:36.228
- Well, it's a surprise.

748
00:51:40.145 --> 00:51:42.728
- For you, our little doll.

749
00:51:48.353 --> 00:51:51.019
Black is traditional.

750
00:51:51.187 --> 00:51:55.687
But if you'd prefer pink
or vermillion or chartreuse.

751
00:51:57.103 --> 00:51:58.144
- [gasps]

752
00:51:58.312 --> 00:52:00.312
- Though you might
make me jealous.

753
00:52:00.478 --> 00:52:01.811
- No way!

754
00:52:01.978 --> 00:52:03.686
You're not sewing buttons in my eyes!

755
00:52:03.853 --> 00:52:06.686
- Oh, but we need a yes
if you want to stay here.

756
00:52:06.853 --> 00:52:10.186
- So sharp, you won't
feel a thi-- ow!

757
00:52:10.353 --> 00:52:14.853
- There now,
it's your decision, darling.

758
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.478
We only want what's best for you.

759
00:52:17.645 --> 00:52:19.936
- I'm going to bed
right now!

760
00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:22.353
- Bed?
- Before dinner?

761
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.186
- I'm really,
really tired, yeah.

762
00:52:25.353 --> 00:52:26.478
[yawns]

763
00:52:26.645 --> 00:52:29.270
I just need to sleep on things.

764
00:52:29.437 --> 00:52:30.687
- Well, of course
you do, darling.

765
00:52:30.853 --> 00:52:32.644
I'll be happy to tuck you in.

766
00:52:32.812 --> 00:52:35.353
- Oh, no thanks.
You've done so much already.

767
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.853
- You're welcome.

768
00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.353
And I--

769
00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:42.186
We aren't worried at all, darling.

770
00:52:42.353 --> 00:52:46.144
Soon you'll see things our way.

771
00:53:03.312 --> 00:53:05.270
- What's wrong, Coraline?

772
00:53:05.437 --> 00:53:08.312
Don't you wanna play?

773
00:53:08.478 --> 00:53:10.686
- Yeah.
I wanna hug your face.

774
00:53:10.853 --> 00:53:12.769
- Get a grip, soldier!

775
00:53:12.937 --> 00:53:15.728
- Hey, where's your
buttons, Loper?

776
00:53:15.895 --> 00:53:18.103
- You wanna stay, don't you?

777
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:20.103
- Going home tonight, robots.

778
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:23.395
And I won't... be... back.

779
00:53:29.853 --> 00:53:32.853
- Go to sleep, go to sleep.

780
00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:34.561
- [Other Mother's voice]
Little thing we need to do.

781
00:53:34.728 --> 00:53:35.769
- [Other Father's voice]
So sharp, you won't

782
00:53:35.937 --> 00:53:37.145
feel a thing.

783
00:53:37.312 --> 00:53:38.603
- Go to sleep, go to sleep.

784
00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:40.770
- Soon you'll see things
our way.

785
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.061
- Mom!
Dad!

786
00:53:52.228 --> 00:53:54.936
[gasps] Oh, God.

787
00:53:55.103 --> 00:53:56.811
I'm still here?

788
00:54:00.562 --> 00:54:01.728
[rattles]

789
00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:08.353
[piano playing]

790
00:54:09.562 --> 00:54:11.603
[banging keys]

791
00:54:13.312 --> 00:54:16.812
- Hey, you!
Where's the Other Mother?

792
00:54:16.978 --> 00:54:18.769
- I wanna go home!
- [bangs]

793
00:54:18.937 --> 00:54:22.270
All will be swell soon
as Mother's refreshed.

794
00:54:22.437 --> 00:54:24.728
Her strength is our strength.

795
00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:31.519
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

796
00:54:31.687 --> 00:54:34.187
- If you won't even talk to me,
I'm gonna find the Other Wybie.

797
00:54:34.353 --> 00:54:36.978
He'll help me.
- No point.

798
00:54:37.145 --> 00:54:40.020
He pulled a long face.

799
00:54:40.187 --> 00:54:41.478
And Mother didn't like it.

800
00:54:42.645 --> 00:54:44.186
- Oh!

801
00:55:02.187 --> 00:55:04.103
[crickets chirping]

802
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.811
[cat meows]

803
00:55:05.978 --> 00:55:08.728
And what do you think you're doing?

804
00:55:08.895 --> 00:55:11.895
- Well, I'm getting
out of here.

805
00:55:12.062 --> 00:55:13.395
That's what I'm doing.

806
00:55:15.312 --> 00:55:17.853
Huh? Something's wrong.

807
00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:19.311
Shouldn't the old well be here?

808
00:55:19.478 --> 00:55:21.186
- Nothing out here.

809
00:55:21.353 --> 00:55:23.978
It's the empty part of this world.

810
00:55:24.145 --> 00:55:27.686
She only made what
she knew would impress you.

811
00:55:27.853 --> 00:55:29.019
- But why?

812
00:55:29.187 --> 00:55:30.937
Why does she want me?

813
00:55:31.103 --> 00:55:33.811
- She wants something
to love, I think.

814
00:55:33.978 --> 00:55:36.311
Something that isn't her.

815
00:55:36.478 --> 00:55:40.978
Or maybe she just loves something to eat.

816
00:55:41.312 --> 00:55:42.895
- Eat?

817
00:55:43.062 --> 00:55:45.562
That's ridiculous.
Mothers don't eat daughters.

818
00:55:45.728 --> 00:55:48.603
- I don't know.
How do you taste?

819
00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:50.853
[chuckles]

820
00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.520
- Huh?

821
00:55:57.687 --> 00:56:00.728
But how can you walk away from something

822
00:56:00.895 --> 00:56:03.311
and still come back to it?

823
00:56:04.478 --> 00:56:06.853
- Walk around the world.

824
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.853
- Small world.

825
00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.936
- [distant fanfare plays]
- Hang on!

826
00:56:13.478 --> 00:56:14.686
[squeaks]

827
00:56:14.853 --> 00:56:18.561
- Stop!
He's one of the circus mice!

828
00:56:18.728 --> 00:56:20.686
- [squeaks]
- [crunches]

829
00:56:20.853 --> 00:56:22.394
[gasps]

830
00:56:26.895 --> 00:56:29.686
- I don't like rats
at the best of times.

831
00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:33.644
But this one was sounding an alarm.

832
00:56:35.895 --> 00:56:37.478
- Good Kitty.

833
00:57:14.228 --> 00:57:17.686
- They say even the proudest
spirit can be broken...

834
00:57:17.853 --> 00:57:19.478
with love.

835
00:57:21.353 --> 00:57:22.353
[gasps]

836
00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:26.686
- Of course, chocolate
never hurts.

837
00:57:26.853 --> 00:57:28.728
Like one?

838
00:57:28.895 --> 00:57:32.853
They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.

839
00:57:34.103 --> 00:57:36.019
- Ugh!

840
00:57:36.187 --> 00:57:38.395
I want to be

841
00:57:38.562 --> 00:57:41.145
with my real mom and dad!

842
00:57:41.312 --> 00:57:43.978
I want you to let me go!

843
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.436
- Is that any way
to talk to your mother?

844
00:57:47.603 --> 00:57:50.103
- You aren't my mother.

845
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:54.770
- Apologize at once,
Coraline!

846
00:57:55.353 --> 00:57:58.144
- No!

847
00:57:58.312 --> 00:58:00.853
- I'll give you
to the count of three.

848
00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.228
One...

849
00:58:05.395 --> 00:58:08.520
two...

850
00:58:08.687 --> 00:58:10.353
[yells] three!

851
00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.186
- Ow!
What are you doing?

852
00:58:13.353 --> 00:58:15.853
Ow, that hurts!

853
00:58:18.562 --> 00:58:22.437
- You may come out when you've
learned to be a loving daughter!

854
00:58:23.603 --> 00:58:24.686
- [shouts]

855
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.145
[panting]

856
00:58:32.645 --> 00:58:34.353
[gasps]

857
00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.811
Who's there?

858
00:58:35.978 --> 00:58:38.519
- Hush and shush.

859
00:58:38.687 --> 00:58:41.478
For the Beldam might be listening.

860
00:58:41.645 --> 00:58:44.145
- You...

861
00:58:44.312 --> 00:58:46.728
you mean, the Other Mother?

862
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.728
Who are you?

863
00:58:59.895 --> 00:59:02.478
- Don't remember our names.

864
00:59:02.645 --> 00:59:06.770
But I remember my true mommy.

865
00:59:06.937 --> 00:59:09.562
- Why are you all here?

866
00:59:09.728 --> 00:59:12.019
- The Beldam.

867
00:59:12.187 --> 00:59:16.687
- She spied on our lives
through the little doll's eyes.

868
00:59:17.478 --> 00:59:21.311
- And saw
that we weren't happy.

869
00:59:21.478 --> 00:59:25.228
- So she lured us away
with treasures and treats...

870
00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:27.686
- And games to play.

871
00:59:27.853 --> 00:59:29.519
- Gave all that we asked

872
00:59:29.687 --> 00:59:32.687
- Yet we still wanted more.

873
00:59:32.853 --> 00:59:36.561
- So we let her
sew the buttons.

874
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.103
- She said
that she loved us.

875
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:44.978
But she locked us here...

876
00:59:45.145 --> 00:59:47.686
- [all] And ate up our lives.

877
00:59:49.478 --> 00:59:53.978
- Well, she can't keep me
in the dark forever.

878
00:59:55.353 --> 00:59:59.644
Not if she wants to win my life.

879
00:59:59.812 --> 01:00:03.312
Beating her is my only chance.

880
01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:06.519
- Perhaps if you do
win your escape,

881
01:00:06.687 --> 01:00:08.520
you could find our eyes.

882
01:00:08.687 --> 01:00:10.853
- Has she taken those too?

883
01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.853
- Yes, miss,
and hidden them.

884
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.936
- Find our eyes,
mistress,

885
01:00:16.103 --> 01:00:19.853
and our souls will be freed.

886
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.811
- I'll try.

887
01:00:22.978 --> 01:00:24.728
[gasps]

888
01:00:24.895 --> 01:00:29.395
[grunting]

889
01:00:30.103 --> 01:00:31.519
- Wybie?

890
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.270
Did she do this to you?

891
01:00:42.437 --> 01:00:45.312
I hope that feels better.
- Shh!

892
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.853
- [Beldam] Coraline?
Is that you?

893
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.686
- Let's go!

894
01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.645
[gasps]

895
01:00:58.812 --> 01:01:01.520
- Coraline?
- [rattles]

896
01:01:01.687 --> 01:01:04.853
- Come on.
She'll hurt you again.

897
01:01:09.853 --> 01:01:11.686
- Coraline?

898
01:01:11.853 --> 01:01:13.936
How dare you disobey your mother!

899
01:01:15.603 --> 01:01:17.269
- [gasps]

900
01:01:17.437 --> 01:01:20.062

didn't you?

just like you.

- Can you unlock it?

929
01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:56.395
- Not in a million years.
But it wouldn't matter.

930
01:02:56.562 --> 01:02:58.353
She can't escape without her eyes.

931

1263
01:26:34.395 --> 01:26:35.395
- But...

1264
01:26:35.562 --> 01:26:38.687
- Well, get yourself cleaned up.
We're going out tonight.

1265
01:26:38.853 --> 01:26:40.644
- We got a lot
to celebrate.

1266
01:26:40.812 --> 01:26:44.228
- You're talking about
your garden catalog?

1267
01:26:44.395 --> 01:26:47.061
- Of course.
What else?

1268
01:26:47.228 --> 01:26:49.728
- But look at the snow
on your clothes.

1269
01:26:49.895 --> 01:26:52.520
- What's gotten
into you, Coraline?

1270
01:27:02.728 --> 01:27:05.644
- [Dad] Oh! Oh!

1271
01:27:05.812 --> 01:27:07.353
- [chuckles]

1272
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.270
So gonna order the tulips?

1273
01:27:09.437 --> 01:27:11.812
- What's that?
- For the garden party?

1274
01:27:11.978 --> 01:27:14.353
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1275
01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:16.478
- Dad!

1276
01:27:16.645 --> 01:27:18.103
So, Mom, invitations?

1277
01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:20.020
Don't forget the invitations.

1278
01:27:20.187 --> 01:27:21.395
- Even Bobinsky?

1279
01:27:21.562 --> 01:27:23.603
- Mr. B's not drunk, Mom.

1280
01:27:23.770 --> 01:27:26.186
He's just eccentric.

1281
01:27:26.353 --> 01:27:28.019
- [laughs]

1282
01:27:28.187 --> 01:27:29.687
- Good night, Coraline.

1283
01:27:32.853 --> 01:27:34.478
[door creaks]

1284
01:27:39.062 --> 01:27:40.687
[door closes]

1285
01:27:46.353 --> 01:27:48.769
[meows]

1286
01:27:48.937 --> 01:27:52.228
- Oh, hello again.

1287
01:27:53.395 --> 01:27:55.561
You still mad?

1288
01:27:55.728 --> 01:27:58.561
I'm really sorry I threw you at her--

1289
01:27:58.728 --> 01:28:00.561
The Other Mother.

1290
01:28:00.728 --> 01:28:03.228
It was all I could think of.

1291
01:28:17.437 --> 01:28:20.187
I think it's time, don't you?

1292
01:28:20.353 --> 01:28:22.478
To set them free?

1293
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:48.645
- It's a fine, fine thing
you did for us, miss.

1294
01:28:48.812 --> 01:28:53.312
- Well, I'm glad
it's finally over.

1295
01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:56.853
- It is over and done with...
for us.

1296
01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.478
- What about me?

1297
01:28:58.645 --> 01:29:01.186
- You're in terrible
danger, girl!

1298
01:29:01.353 --> 01:29:03.853
- But how?
I locked the door!

1299
01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:06.436
- It's the key, miss.
There's only one,

1300
01:29:06.603 --> 01:29:09.603
and the Beldam will find it.

1301
01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:12.061
- 'Tain't all bad, miss.

1302
01:29:12.228 --> 01:29:16.728
Thou art alive. Thou art still living.

1303
01:29:24.687 --> 01:29:25.687
[gasps]

1304
01:29:28.062 --> 01:29:29.520
- I gotta hide this
somewhere.

1305
01:29:29.687 --> 01:29:31.937
Somewhere she can never--

1306
01:29:38.103 --> 01:29:39.103
[meows]

1307
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:41.061
- Out of my way!

1308
01:29:42.228 --> 01:29:43.561
[door creaks]

1309
01:29:51.062 --> 01:29:53.062
[creaking]

1310
01:29:56.395 --> 01:29:59.728
- "Oh, my twitchy
witchy girl,

1311
01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:01.853
I think you are so nice.

1312
01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:03.561
I give you bowls of porridge,

1313
01:30:03.728 --> 01:30:07.186
and I give you bowls of ice... cream.

1314
01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.020
I give you lots of kisses...

1315
01:30:11.187 --> 01:30:13.145
[rattles]

1316
01:30:13.312 --> 01:30:15.812
- ...and I give you
lots of hugs.

1317
01:30:15.978 --> 01:30:18.103
But I never give you sandwiches

1318
01:30:18.270 --> 01:30:22.770
with grease and worms and mung... beans."

1319
01:30:30.937 --> 01:30:32.270
[rattles]

1320
01:30:34.145 --> 01:30:35.811

Oh-hh!

1329
01:31:07.603 --> 01:31:08.811
Get off!

1330
01:31:10.312 --> 01:31:12.062
[screams]

1331
01:31:12.228 --> 01:31:14.103

[water splashes]

1338
01:31:54.312 --> 01:31:55.978
- I'm really sorry
I didn't believe you

1339
01:31:56.145 --> 01:32:00.645
about all this evil stuff, Coraline.

1340
01:32:00.937 --> 01:32:03.145
- Why did you change
your mind?

1341
01:32:03.312 --> 01:32:05.103
- Well, Grandma showed me
this picture...

1342
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:08.978
after I called you crazy.

1343
01:32:09.145 --> 01:32:12.145
It's her and her sister
before she disappeared.

1344
01:32:12.312 --> 01:32:13.728
- The sweet ghost girl.

1345
01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:17.603
- Wyborne! Come home!
- [bell ringing]

1346
01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:19.978
- [sighs] Oh, man.

1347
01:32:20.145 --> 01:32:21.353
What am I gonna tell her?

1348
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.020
- Just bring her
by the house tomorrow.

1349
01:32:25.187 --> 01:32:27.478
We can tell her together.

1350
01:32:27.645 --> 01:32:29.645
- We-- we can?

1351
01:32:29.812 --> 01:32:33.228
- You know, I'm glad
you decided to stalk me.

1352
01:32:33.395 --> 01:32:34.478
[giggles]

1353
01:32:34.645 --> 01:32:36.395
- It wasn't my idea.

1354
01:32:36.562 --> 01:32:37.562
- [meows]

1355
01:33:02.437 --> 01:33:05.520
- Thanks for helping me,
Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.

1356
01:33:05.687 --> 01:33:08.812
- Oh, look, April,
Pink Ladies!

1357
01:33:08.978 --> 01:33:11.061
- Actually,
it's just lemonade.

1358
01:33:11.228 --> 01:33:12.769
How's Angus doing?

1359
01:33:12.937 --> 01:33:14.645
- Oh, much better, dear.

1360
01:33:14.812 --> 01:33:18.187
But he can't duck his wings forever.

1361
01:33:18.353 --> 01:33:19.811
- Here comes a burp.
[belches]

1362
01:33:19.978 --> 01:33:21.561
- Charlie!

1363
01:33:21.728 --> 01:33:25.644
- Oh, excusez-moi, but
that pizza was delicious.

1364
01:33:25.812 --> 01:33:28.145
- Cold drinks?
- Oh, yeah, great.

1365
01:33:28.312 --> 01:33:31.603
- You were right, Coraline.
I really hate dirt!

1366
01:33:31.770 --> 01:33:34.645
But the tulips look nice.

1367
01:33:34.812 --> 01:33:38.478
- Thanks, Mom.

1368
01:33:38.645 --> 01:33:40.853
- [Mr. B. muttering] Nyet, nyet.

1369
01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:43.228
Da, da, that is possible--

1370
01:33:43.395 --> 01:33:45.686
- Ahem!

1371
01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.853
How are the mooshkas, Mr. B?

1372
01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:51.645
- They tell me that you
are savior, Caroline.

1373
01:33:51.812 --> 01:33:53.312
And soon as they are ready,

1374
01:33:53.478 --> 01:33:56.769
they wish to give special
"thanks you" performance.

1375
01:33:56.937 --> 01:34:01.187
- Wyborne, I know
where I'm goin'.

1376
01:34:01.353 --> 01:34:02.478
I grew up here.

1377
01:34:02.645 --> 01:34:04.770
- Welcome, Ms. Lovat!

1378
01:34:04.937 --> 01:34:07.437
- Oh, hello.

1379
01:34:08.853 --> 01:34:10.978
- I'm Coraline Jones.

1380
01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:13.145
I've got so much to tell you!

1381
01:34:13.312 --> 01:34:14.978
- [Mom] Here.
- [Dad] Thanks.

1382
01:34:15.145 --> 01:34:17.478
- [April] Do you want to pop
a little gin in it, dear?

1383
01:34:17.645 --> 01:34:19.478
- [Miriam] Of course.

1384
01:34:28.478 --> 01:34:30.644
