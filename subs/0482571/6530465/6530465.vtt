00:00:57.396 --> 00:00:58.931
<i>Are you watching closely?</i>

2
00:01:05.738 --> 00:01:10.275
<i>Every magic trick
consists of three parts or acts.</i>

3
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.707
<i>The first part is called the Pledge.</i>

4
00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:17.128
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary...</i>

5
00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:20.744
<i>a deck of cards, a bird, or a man.</i>

6
00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:29.682
<i>He shows you this object...</i>

7
00:01:29.762 --> 00:01:31.964
<i>perhaps he asks you to inspect it...</i>

8
00:01:32.932 --> 00:01:35.646
<i>to see that it is, indeed, real.</i>

9
00:01:35.726 --> 00:01:39.054
<i>Yeah, unaltered, normal.</i>

10
00:01:42.107 --> 00:01:45.269
<i>But of course, it probably isn't.</i>

11
00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:49.523
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

12
00:02:02.294 --> 00:02:04.955
<i>The second act is called the Turn.</i>

13
00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:22.389
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something...</i>

14
00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.186
<i>and makes it
do something extraordinary.</i>

15
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.456
<i>Now, you're looking for the secret,
but you won't find it...</i>

16
00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:39.031
<i>because, of course,
you're not really looking.</i>

17
00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:41.325
<i>You don't really wanna know.</i>

18
00:02:44.336 --> 00:02:46.914
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>

19
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:50.542
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet...</i>

20
00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:55.339
<i>because making something disappear
isn't enough.</i>

21
00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:59.259
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

22
00:03:00.352 --> 00:03:04.151
<i>That's why every magic trick
has a third act.</i>

23
00:03:04.231 --> 00:03:06.016
<i>The hardest part.</i>

24
00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:10.020
<i>The part we call the Prestige.</i>

25
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:24.797
The Prestige. And did Robert Angier,
the Great Danton, your employer...

26
00:03:24.877 --> 00:03:27.633
get to that final part
of his trick that night?

27
00:03:27.713 --> 00:03:30.594
- No, sir. Something went wrong.
- What went wrong?

28
00:03:30.674 --> 00:03:34.265
I saw someone
making their way below stage.

29
00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.141
I followed him.

30
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.562
It was Borden,
watching Mr. Angier drown.

31
00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:42.982
Would you please describe
your occupation to the jury, Mr. Cutter?

32
00:03:43.062 --> 00:03:44.233
I'm an <i>ingénieur.</i>

33
00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:48.779
I design illusions and construct the
apparatus necessary for performing them.

34
00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:49.947
So, Mr. Cutter...

35
00:03:50.027 --> 00:03:53.284
was this water-filled tank
beneath the stage...

36
00:03:53.364 --> 00:03:55.202
part of Mr. Angier's illusion?

37
00:03:55.282 --> 00:03:56.495
No, no. It was--

38
00:03:56.575 --> 00:04:00.833
The tank was brought on for the first trick
and then taken off-stage.

39
00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:04.169
Borden must have placed it
under the trap door after the interval.

40
00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.754
How large was this tank?

41
00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:10.509
Oh, it's a normal tank for escape
underwater, about 4 or 500 gallons.

42
00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.052
How do you think Mr. Borden...

43
00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:15.681
was able to move the tank under
the trap door without anyone noticing?

44
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:17.641
He's a magician. Ask him.

45
00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:22.354
I ask again that this man explain
the mechanics of Mr. Angier's illusion.

46
00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:24.023
The Real Transported Man...

47
00:04:24.103 --> 00:04:27.192
is one of the most sought-after
illusions in this business.

48
00:04:27.272 --> 00:04:28.861
I have the right to sell it on.

49
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:31.614
If I reveal the method here,
then the trick is worthless.

50
00:04:31.694 --> 00:04:35.939
How can we know that the tank wasn't
some part of the trick that went wrong?

51
00:04:36.532 --> 00:04:38.662
Mr. Cutter, I see your predicament...

52
00:04:38.742 --> 00:04:41.194
but Alfred Borden's life
hangs in the balance.

53
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.376
If you were prepared to disclose
the details to me in private...

54
00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:47.129
I might be able to judge
their relevance to the case.

55
00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.995
Might this be an acceptable compromise?

56
00:05:08.272 --> 00:05:11.600
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn out your pockets.

57
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:17.076
Not my idea, sir.

58
00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:21.246
The warden saw his show in Manchester
last year where he vanished into thin air.

59
00:05:21.326 --> 00:05:24.488
He's convinced he'll try and escape.

60
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:30.047
I told him the only way
that Borden's gonna disappear...

61
00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:33.497
is if I leave him out there
with the other inmates.

62
00:05:38.385 --> 00:05:39.836
Check the locks.

63
00:05:41.472 --> 00:05:43.674
Twice.

64
00:05:50.022 --> 00:05:52.611
My name is Owens.

65
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:54.947
I'm a solicitor.

66
00:05:55.027 --> 00:05:58.784
I represent Lord Caldlow, an accomplished
amateur magician and historian--

67
00:05:58.864 --> 00:06:00.774
How much?

68
00:06:01.283 --> 00:06:03.831
- Lord Caldlow is interested--
- How much for my tricks?

69
00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:05.290
Five thousand pounds.

70
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.960
Talk with Fallon, my ingénieur.
Money's for him.

71
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.797
Yes, I did.
He offered to sell me your tricks.

72
00:06:11.877 --> 00:06:14.675
All except the most valuable one:
The Transported Man.

73
00:06:14.755 --> 00:06:18.011
Well, I wouldn't forgive myself
for selling my greatest trick.

74
00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:19.584
Even for your daughter?

75
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.851
If the newspapers are right
and you are for the drop...

76
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.008
your daughter is
going to need looking after.

77
00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:27.396
Fallon will take care of her.

78
00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:30.983
Bernard Fallon? A man with a past
almost as obscure as your own.

79
00:06:31.063 --> 00:06:33.777
The courts have motioned that the girl
be removed from his care.

80
00:06:33.857 --> 00:06:36.476
No, the girl will be an orphan.

81
00:06:36.902 --> 00:06:41.410
I know you're no stranger to the workhouse.
It's better than here?

82
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.621
I'm offering you a way
to wrap up your affairs with dignity.

83
00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:46.665
And I'm offering your daughter a future.

84
00:06:46.745 --> 00:06:50.574
As Lord Caldlow's ward,
she will want for nothing. Ever.

85
00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:54.661
Well, think it over.

86
00:06:55.254 --> 00:06:59.678
And Lord Caldlow would like you
to have this as a show of good faith.

87
00:06:59.758 --> 00:07:03.223
He said it might be of interest.
This is Robert Angier's diary.

88
00:07:03.303 --> 00:07:06.185
Including the time he spent
in Colorado learning your trick.

89
00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:07.853
- He never learned my trick.
- Really?

90
00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:11.523
On his return from Colorado, he mounted
a version of The Transported Man...

91
00:07:11.603 --> 00:07:15.527
that the papers said
was better even than your original.

92
00:07:15.607 --> 00:07:21.707
If you want Angier's secrets,
you go dig him up and ask him yourself.

93
00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:25.317
I want your secret, Mr. Borden.

94
00:07:27.452 --> 00:07:28.820
Consider your daughter.

95
00:07:36.253 --> 00:07:40.373
<i>A cipher. An enigma.</i>

96
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.922
<i>A search. A search for answers.</i>

97
00:07:52.644 --> 00:07:56.527
<i>Even if Colorado
is the end of my journey...</i>

98
00:07:56.607 --> 00:08:02.521
<i>it'll take much longer to unravel
the rest of Borden's secrets.</i>

99
00:08:03.906 --> 00:08:08.580
<i>See, the cipher in his notebook
is unlocked by a single word...</i>

100
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.939
<i>but it will still take
months to translate his writing</i>

101
00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:14.668
<i>and to know his mind.</i>

102
00:08:17.252 --> 00:08:20.831
<i>Well, my passion is equal to the task.</i>

103
00:08:32.684 --> 00:08:36.680
Mr. Angier?
Welcome to Colorado Springs.

104
00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:55.282
- The whole town has electricity.
- Yes, sir.

105
00:09:11.807 --> 00:09:14.897
Well, quite a reception.

106
00:09:14.977 --> 00:09:17.441
You're our first guest of the season,
Mr. Angier.

107
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:20.986
Your telegram didn't indicate
how long you'll be staying with us.

108
00:09:21.066 --> 00:09:22.654
For as long as it takes.

109
00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:25.991
I'll need a coach tomorrow
to take me up the mountain.

110
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.703
Well, the peak is closed, sir,
for scientific experimentation.

111
00:09:29.783 --> 00:09:33.236
Yes, I know. That's why I'm here.

112
00:09:44.256 --> 00:09:47.834
You'll have to walk the rest,
I'm afraid, sir.

113
00:10:22.753 --> 00:10:28.708
I'm amazed how many of you
newspaper writers can't read my sign.

114
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.632
Not the welcome I was expecting.

115
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.637
I know you.

116
00:10:44.316 --> 00:10:49.074
You're the Great Danton.
I saw your show in London seven times.

117
00:10:49.154 --> 00:10:53.537
You guessed every object
the audience had in their pockets.

118
00:10:53.617 --> 00:10:55.080
I'm Alley.

119
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.708
Sorry about the fence.
People interfere with our work.

120
00:10:57.788 --> 00:11:00.419
- I've come to see Tesla.
- Why?

121
00:11:00.499 --> 00:11:04.423
He made a machine
for a colleague of mine sometime ago.

122
00:11:04.503 --> 00:11:08.093
- Can you get me a meeting with him?
- Impossible, I'm afraid.

123
00:11:08.173 --> 00:11:10.429
I brought a lot of money.

124
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:12.252
I'm sorry, Mr. Angier.

125
00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:16.298
I simply can't help you.

126
00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:20.760
I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.

127
00:11:23.438 --> 00:11:24.848
Hey, what am I holding?

128
00:11:25.524 --> 00:11:27.017
Your watch.

129
00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:37.414
<i>Borden's journal entry for April 3rd, 1897,
describes a show at the Orpheum Theater.</i>

130
00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:41.531
<i>That was just days after he first met me.</i>

131
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:46.465
<i>We were two young men
at the start of a great career.</i>

132
00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:49.134
<i>Two young men devoted to an illusion.</i>

133
00:11:49.214 --> 00:11:51.470
<i>Two young men
who never intended to hurt anyone.</i>

134
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:56.254
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

135
00:12:08.358 --> 00:12:09.934
If you would tie her wrists.

136
00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:15.452
Bind her feet around the ankle.

137
00:12:15.532 --> 00:12:17.621
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

138
00:12:17.701 --> 00:12:19.611
- No.
- No.

139
00:12:20.287 --> 00:12:23.907
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

140
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.152
He's complacent,
he's predictable, he's boring.

141
00:13:30.232 --> 00:13:32.904
I mean, Milton has gotten success,
whatever that means...

142
00:13:32.984 --> 00:13:35.866
and now he's scared.
He won't take any risks at all.

143
00:13:35.946 --> 00:13:38.743
I mean, he's squandering
the goodwill of the audience...

144
00:13:38.823 --> 00:13:41.872
- with tired, second-rate tricks.
- They're old favorites.

145
00:13:41.952 --> 00:13:45.417
Favorites? Give me something fresh.
He won't even try a bullet catch.

146
00:13:45.497 --> 00:13:47.169
A bullet catch is suicide.

147
00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:51.256
All it takes is some smart-ass volunteer
to put a button in the barrel.

148
00:13:51.336 --> 00:13:53.758
- Fine. Use a plant.
- You can't for every trick.

149
00:13:53.838 --> 00:13:56.761
- There'd be no seats left for the punters.
- No bullet catch.

150
00:13:56.841 --> 00:14:01.266
Whatever. The point is that a real magician
tries to invent something new...

151
00:14:01.346 --> 00:14:04.227
that other magicians
are gonna scratch their heads over.

152
00:14:04.307 --> 00:14:06.563
And then you sell it to him
for a small fortune.

153
00:14:06.643 --> 00:14:07.731
- All right.
- Yeah.

154
00:14:07.811 --> 00:14:09.733
I suppose you have such a trick.

155
00:14:09.813 --> 00:14:12.319
- Actually, I do.
- Would you care to sell it to me?

156
00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.029
No.
No one else could do my trick.

157
00:14:14.109 --> 00:14:16.239
- Any trick can be duplicated, right?
- Wrong.

158
00:14:16.319 --> 00:14:19.284
If Mr. Borden
has invented his masterpiece...

159
00:14:19.364 --> 00:14:21.733
it might be only he's prepared to do it.

160
00:14:21.908 --> 00:14:24.164
Milton is a great showman,
but Borden is right.

161
00:14:24.244 --> 00:14:26.029
He won't get his hands dirty.

162
00:14:26.246 --> 00:14:30.462
If you wanna see what it takes
to make real magic, go to the Tenley.

163
00:14:30.542 --> 00:14:33.340
There's a Chinaman there,
and he really has what it takes.

164
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.759
- Chung Ling Soo.
- Pricey. I can't afford that.

165
00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:37.469
I know the bloke on the door.

166
00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:39.971
You two go and see that show...

167
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:42.015
and whichever one of you
can tell me...

168
00:14:42.095 --> 00:14:44.059
how he does
the goldfish-bowl trick...

169
00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:45.518
- gets a prize.
- All right.

170
00:14:45.598 --> 00:14:47.354
- Which is?
- Ten minutes on-stage...

171
00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:49.314
with my old friend Mr. Ackerman.

172
00:14:49.394 --> 00:14:50.815
- Really?
- Who's Ackerman?

173
00:14:50.895 --> 00:14:53.223
The top theatrical agent in London.

174
00:14:54.482 --> 00:14:56.196
I saw you drop the knot again.

175
00:14:56.276 --> 00:14:57.421
I think I turned my wrist.

176
00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.699
Some nights,
you just don't get it, do you?

177
00:14:59.779 --> 00:15:03.828
I mean, if that knot slips and Julia's
on the hoist, she'll break a leg.

178
00:15:03.908 --> 00:15:08.333
It's the wrong knot. Like I said,
the Langford double will hold tighter.

179
00:15:08.413 --> 00:15:12.128
The Langford double isn't a wet knot.
It's too dangerous.

180
00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:14.381
If the rope swells up, she won't slip it.

181
00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:17.676
- I can slip a Langford underwater.
- She can slip it. We'll practice.

182
00:15:17.756 --> 00:15:19.177
Hey, Borden, he said no.

183
00:15:19.257 --> 00:15:21.680
Yeah, well, you know knots
better than me, do you?

184
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.878
Listen, no more mistakes.

185
00:15:24.137 --> 00:15:26.518
All right. Yeah, do you?
You wanna take over?

186
00:15:26.598 --> 00:15:29.634
- Just leave it.
- I didn't think so.

187
00:15:33.897 --> 00:15:36.569
- Hey, Cutter, where's he from?
- Where are you from?

188
00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:38.608
He shifts props for Virgil at the hall.

189
00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.032
Aren't you worried
he'll steal your tricks?

190
00:15:41.112 --> 00:15:43.493
- He doesn't deal in methods.
- How do you know?

191
00:15:43.573 --> 00:15:48.748
Because I hired him to find out
how Virgil does the orange trick.

192
00:15:48.828 --> 00:15:51.251
- Well, I don't trust him.
- He's a natural magician.

193
00:15:51.331 --> 00:15:52.991
Of course you can't trust him.

194
00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:54.754
I think he's all right.

195
00:15:54.834 --> 00:15:57.257
- You think everyone's all right.
- Even you.

196
00:15:57.337 --> 00:16:01.136
Watch your sightlines. If I can see you
kissing your wife's leg every night...

197
00:16:01.216 --> 00:16:03.960
so can the blokes
at the ends of row three and four.

198
00:16:36.376 --> 00:16:38.423
<i>- You're wrong. It can't be.
- No, it is.</i>

199
00:16:38.503 --> 00:16:42.052
- Look at the man.
- This is the trick.

200
00:16:42.132 --> 00:16:46.878
This is a performance right here.
This is why no one can detect his method.

201
00:16:48.555 --> 00:16:50.214
Total devotion to his art.

202
00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:55.273
Utter self-sacrifice, you know?

203
00:16:55.353 --> 00:17:01.184
It's the only way to escape all this,
you know.

204
00:17:03.153 --> 00:17:04.240
All right.

205
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:08.441
I can barely lift this thing
and it's not even filled with water.

206
00:17:09.617 --> 00:17:11.998
Or fish. Look.

207
00:17:12.078 --> 00:17:14.405
I don't know. Hang on a second.

208
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:19.535
He must be strong as an ox.

209
00:17:21.671 --> 00:17:24.511
He's been pretending
to be a cripple for years.

210
00:17:24.591 --> 00:17:28.139
Any time he's in public. Any time
he goes out. It's unthinkable.

211
00:17:28.219 --> 00:17:31.267
Borden saw it at once,
but I couldn't fathom it.

212
00:17:31.347 --> 00:17:34.020
Living my whole life
pretending to be someone else.

213
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.857
- You're pretending to be someone else.
- I don't think changing a name compares.

214
00:17:37.937 --> 00:17:40.485
Not just your name.
Who you are and where you're from.

215
00:17:40.565 --> 00:17:45.019
I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass
them with my theatrical endeavors.

216
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.439
I thought of a name for you.

217
00:17:49.657 --> 00:17:51.818
The Great Danton.

218
00:17:53.244 --> 00:17:54.445
Do you like it?

219
00:17:55.371 --> 00:17:57.782
- But it's sophisticated.
- It's French.

220
00:18:04.255 --> 00:18:07.959
<i>Borden writes as if no one but he
understood the true nature of magic.</i>

221
00:18:13.556 --> 00:18:16.634
<i>But what does he know of self-sacrifice?</i>

222
00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:23.641
You bloody fool.

223
00:18:50.969 --> 00:18:53.516
- He killed it.
- What?

224
00:18:53.596 --> 00:18:54.684
What's wrong?

225
00:18:54.764 --> 00:18:59.010
- He killed it.
- I'm sure he didn't.

226
00:19:02.647 --> 00:19:04.432
See? Look, now
he'll bring it back.

227
00:19:06.568 --> 00:19:09.520
No, he killed it.

228
00:19:10.655 --> 00:19:11.856
No.

229
00:19:17.829 --> 00:19:20.752
Look. See?
He's all right. He's fine.

230
00:19:20.832 --> 00:19:25.036
- Look at him.
- But where's his brother?

231
00:19:27.755 --> 00:19:30.845
He's a sharp lad, your son.

232
00:19:30.925 --> 00:19:33.711
Oh, he's my nephew.

233
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.010
You're the lucky one today.

234
00:20:01.414 --> 00:20:03.908
Are you watching closely?

235
00:20:07.462 --> 00:20:09.080
Look closer.

236
00:20:11.966 --> 00:20:13.918
Never show anyone.

237
00:20:14.177 --> 00:20:16.941
They'll beg you and they'll
flatter you for the secret,

238
00:20:17.021 --> 00:20:18.601
but as soon as you give it up...

239
00:20:18.681 --> 00:20:20.228
you'll be nothing to them.

240
00:20:20.308 --> 00:20:22.605
You understand? Nothing.

241
00:20:22.685 --> 00:20:25.650
The secret impresses no one.

242
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.433
The trick you use it for is everything.

243
00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:38.234
- Well, thank you for lunch, Mr. Borden.
- You're welcome.

244
00:20:39.535 --> 00:20:42.834
- Alfred. It's Alfred.
- Alfred.

245
00:20:42.914 --> 00:20:45.837
So I could use a cup of tea.

246
00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:50.454
I'd scandalize the landlord. I think not.

247
00:20:50.922 --> 00:20:54.083
You think that's--?
Is that enough to keep me out?

248
00:20:56.094 --> 00:20:57.461
I think so.

249
00:20:58.429 --> 00:21:00.256
So I'll see you again?

250
00:21:09.273 --> 00:21:10.892
Milk and sugar?

251
00:21:32.839 --> 00:21:36.959
- What's in there?
- Angier's machine.

252
00:21:45.476 --> 00:21:46.981
You built this, Mr. Cutter?

253
00:21:47.061 --> 00:21:49.942
Oh, no, sir.
This wasn't built by a magician.

254
00:21:50.022 --> 00:21:52.070
This was built by a wizard.

255
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.866
A man who can actually do
what magicians pretend to do.

256
00:21:56.946 --> 00:22:01.412
Tell me, Your Honor, what happens
with these things after the trial?

257
00:22:01.492 --> 00:22:03.289
They've been sold to a Lord Caldlow.

258
00:22:03.369 --> 00:22:06.250
An avid collector,
apparently very interested in the case.

259
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.878
Yeah, well, don't let him take this.

260
00:22:08.958 --> 00:22:10.910
- Why ever not?
- It's too dangerous.

261
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:16.386
I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles
it's got a simple and disappointing trick.

262
00:22:16.466 --> 00:22:19.543
Most disappointing of all, sir...

263
00:22:20.845 --> 00:22:23.089
it has no trick.

264
00:22:25.183 --> 00:22:26.842
It's real.

265
00:22:29.854 --> 00:22:32.223
This is the tank Angier drowned in?

266
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.278
Yes.

267
00:22:34.358 --> 00:22:40.558
This is the place where the performer's
hand reaches through to the trick padlock.

268
00:22:40.865 --> 00:22:43.287
A standard magical apparatus
for escapes.

269
00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:45.832
Yeah, with one important difference:

270
00:22:45.912 --> 00:22:47.917
This isn't a trick lock.

271
00:22:47.997 --> 00:22:50.002
It's been switched for a real one.

272
00:22:50.082 --> 00:22:52.201
What a way to kill someone.

273
00:22:52.543 --> 00:22:56.092
They're magicians, Your Honor.
Showmen.

274
00:22:56.172 --> 00:23:00.418
Men who live by dressing up plain
and sometimes-brutal truths...

275
00:23:00.718 --> 00:23:03.349
to amaze, to shock.

276
00:23:03.429 --> 00:23:06.007
Even without an audience?

277
00:23:06.891 --> 00:23:08.926
There was an audience.

278
00:23:09.602 --> 00:23:11.816
You see, this water tank...

279
00:23:11.896 --> 00:23:16.267
was of particular significance
to these two men.

280
00:23:16.526 --> 00:23:20.646
Particularly awful significance.

281
00:23:21.906 --> 00:23:27.111
Which of you brave souls is willing
to bind this lovely young woman?

282
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.877
If you would tie her wrists.

283
00:23:30.957 --> 00:23:33.325
Bind her feet around the ankle.

284
00:23:46.556 --> 00:23:48.519
Are either of you two gentlemen sailors?

285
00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:49.800
No.

286
00:23:50.643 --> 00:23:54.180
I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot.

287
00:24:48.492 --> 00:24:49.693
Robert!

288
00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:12.591
No! No! No!

289
00:25:15.311 --> 00:25:17.108
Julia. Julia.

290
00:25:17.188 --> 00:25:19.849
Julia! Julia!

291
00:26:04.402 --> 00:26:07.199
I knew an old sailor once.

292
00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:12.371
He told me he went overboard,
tangled in the sails.

293
00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:18.169
They pulled him out,
but it took him five minutes to cough.

294
00:26:18.249 --> 00:26:22.411
He said it was like going home.

295
00:26:27.591 --> 00:26:30.002
What do you want, Borden?

296
00:26:36.684 --> 00:26:38.844
I'm sorry for your loss, Angier.

297
00:26:42.523 --> 00:26:45.017
Which knot did you tie?

298
00:26:47.695 --> 00:26:49.438
I keep asking myself that.

299
00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:53.651
- And?
- And...

300
00:26:54.618 --> 00:26:57.488
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

301
00:26:59.457 --> 00:27:01.116
You don't know?

302
00:27:02.376 --> 00:27:04.620
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:07.706
You don't know?

304
00:27:11.927 --> 00:27:14.171
You don't know?

305
00:27:20.352 --> 00:27:21.691
Alfred?

306
00:27:21.771 --> 00:27:24.068
Good news.
We got our first booking today.

307
00:27:24.148 --> 00:27:27.279
- I don't think we've had the pleasure.
- Mr. Fallon is my ingénieur.

308
00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:30.908
- Where did you get all of--?
- Begged, borrowed, and don't ask.

309
00:27:30.988 --> 00:27:35.162
He's a very enterprising soul,
is Mr. Fallon.

310
00:27:35.242 --> 00:27:36.872
- So--
- We can't afford to pay him.

311
00:27:36.952 --> 00:27:38.791
Money will come
when we get the audience.

312
00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:42.420
But what about until then? I mean,
what I earn, it's barely enough for us.

313
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.869
Don't worry about it. I'll share
half my food with him or something.

314
00:27:46.629 --> 00:27:49.665
You're already going to be doing that
with someone else.

315
00:27:49.799 --> 00:27:53.919
- No. You're--?
- Having a baby.

316
00:27:54.386 --> 00:27:57.768
Oh, my God.
We should have told Fallon.

317
00:27:57.848 --> 00:27:59.729
That is great. We're having a baby.

318
00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:02.052
- We're having a baby.
- Oh, come here.

319
00:28:05.523 --> 00:28:06.902
Alfred, what's this?

320
00:28:06.982 --> 00:28:11.115
Oh, this is just the trick to wake
Ackerman up at the end of my act.

321
00:28:11.195 --> 00:28:13.909
Is it the masterpiece? The great trick?

322
00:28:13.989 --> 00:28:16.620
No, no, no. The world is not ready
for that one yet.

323
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:21.238
This is just your run-of-the-mill,
daring, spectacular bullet catch.

324
00:28:21.664 --> 00:28:26.201
- A bullet catch?
- Yeah, but it's safe, I promise. Look.

325
00:28:28.504 --> 00:28:30.760
- Shoot me.
- Shoot you?

326
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.082
Go on, shoot me.

327
00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:36.599
- Right there.
- No, I can't.

328
00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:39.757
No, no, not there. Shoot me here. Don't--

329
00:28:44.061 --> 00:28:47.985
- How's that?
- That's very good.

330
00:28:48.065 --> 00:28:50.934
- Go on, tell me how you do it.
- No, I can't do that.

331
00:28:53.028 --> 00:28:55.910
- Well, then you can't do it. Alfred--
- I can't do it?

332
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.401
I'm sorry, Alfred,
but I can't raise a child on my own.

333
00:28:59.827 --> 00:29:03.167
- You don't tell anybody that I told you.
- Okay.

334
00:29:03.247 --> 00:29:05.157
Gunpowder...

335
00:29:06.625 --> 00:29:07.826
wadding...

336
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.330
and a bullet.

337
00:29:12.089 --> 00:29:13.749
A ramrod.

338
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.671
Hold out your hand.

339
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.637
The bullet is not even in the gun
when the charge is fired.

340
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.474
Once you know,
it's actually very obvious.

341
00:29:31.442 --> 00:29:33.405
Well, I mean, you still get--

342
00:29:33.485 --> 00:29:36.534
It's dangerous. I mean,
people still get killed doing that.

343
00:29:36.614 --> 00:29:37.910
- Well, how?
- Well, you know.

344
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.038
Somebody could get a smart-ass.
He can put a penny or a button...

345
00:29:41.118 --> 00:29:44.166
or may God forbid, Sarah,
somebody could put a bullet there.

346
00:29:44.246 --> 00:29:46.752
Don't worry. Don't worry...

347
00:29:46.832 --> 00:29:50.214
because I'm not gonna let
anything happen.

348
00:29:50.294 --> 00:29:51.966
Everything's gonna be all right...

349
00:29:52.046 --> 00:29:57.119
because I love you very much.

350
00:30:00.429 --> 00:30:03.841
- Say it again.
- I love you.

351
00:30:04.767 --> 00:30:07.231
- Not today.
- What?

352
00:30:07.311 --> 00:30:10.526
Well, on some days it's not true,
and today you don't mean it.

353
00:30:10.606 --> 00:30:13.779
Maybe today you're more
in love with magic than me.

354
00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:16.282
I like being able to tell the difference.

355
00:30:16.362 --> 00:30:21.483
It makes the days it is true
mean something.

356
00:30:23.494 --> 00:30:25.237
All right.

357
00:30:44.056 --> 00:30:47.104
Metal rings, ladies and gentlemen.

358
00:30:47.184 --> 00:30:50.065
If there are any
ladies or gentlemen here.

359
00:30:50.145 --> 00:30:53.402
- Solid metal.
- Seen that already.

360
00:30:53.482 --> 00:30:56.560
- Leave it out!
- Come on.

361
00:31:00.364 --> 00:31:03.442
Get out your gun, mate.

362
00:31:03.993 --> 00:31:06.195
- Who threw that?
- I did!

363
00:31:11.542 --> 00:31:14.786
Get out your gun.
You're gonna need it.

364
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.250
Get a gun.

365
00:31:21.635 --> 00:31:24.129
It's what you came for, is it?

366
00:31:27.224 --> 00:31:31.595
So who wants to volunteer?

367
00:31:31.895 --> 00:31:34.598
Me! Me!

368
00:31:44.325 --> 00:31:45.943
Me.

369
00:31:46.827 --> 00:31:48.487
Watch it, cowboy.

370
00:31:59.673 --> 00:32:02.251
Are you man enough, sir?

371
00:32:07.139 --> 00:32:08.924
Yes.

372
00:32:19.777 --> 00:32:21.937
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

373
00:32:27.993 --> 00:32:30.362
Which knot did you tie, Borden?

374
00:32:31.455 --> 00:32:33.282
I don't know.

375
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.396
<i>He came in to demand an answer,
and I told him the truth.</i>

376
00:32:52.476 --> 00:32:55.566
<i>That I have fought with myself
over that night.</i>

377
00:32:55.646 --> 00:32:59.194
<i>One half of me swearing blind
that I tied a simple slipknot...</i>

378
00:32:59.274 --> 00:33:02.573
<i>the other half convinced
that I tied the Langford double.</i>

379
00:33:02.653 --> 00:33:05.063
<i>I can never know for sure.</i>

380
00:33:07.449 --> 00:33:09.747
How can he not know?

381
00:33:09.827 --> 00:33:12.362
<i>How can he not know?</i>

382
00:33:13.205 --> 00:33:17.326
<i>He must know what he did. He must.</i>

383
00:33:19.837 --> 00:33:21.997
Sarah, that bloody hurts.

384
00:33:22.923 --> 00:33:25.220
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

385
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.836
It's as bad as the day it happened.

386
00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:34.772
- We have to get a doctor back.
- We can't afford the bloody doctor back.

387
00:33:34.852 --> 00:33:37.804
- You've woken her.
- Great.

388
00:33:38.564 --> 00:33:41.278
I'm sorry. I need this to heal
so I can go back to work.

389
00:33:41.358 --> 00:33:45.157
Alfred, face things. What tricks
can you perform with this kind of injury?

390
00:33:45.237 --> 00:33:48.827
I can do card pulls.
I can do some prop tricks.

391
00:33:48.907 --> 00:33:53.290
I can still do that. And I can do the trick
that I've been telling you about.

392
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.572
The one that they're gonna
remember me for.

393
00:33:57.875 --> 00:33:59.868
Come on.

394
00:34:25.486 --> 00:34:28.283
Never thought I'd find an answer
at the bottom of a glass.

395
00:34:28.363 --> 00:34:30.107
Hasn't stopped you looking.

396
00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.458
Heard about a booking.

397
00:34:36.538 --> 00:34:40.254
Nice little theater.
Young up-and-coming magician.

398
00:34:40.334 --> 00:34:41.839
- Who?
- You.

399
00:34:41.919 --> 00:34:43.674
You got me a booking? Why?

400
00:34:43.754 --> 00:34:45.759
I wanna keep on working.

401
00:34:45.839 --> 00:34:48.971
And who's gonna hire the ingénieur
that killed Julia McCullough...

402
00:34:49.051 --> 00:34:51.461
in front of a sellout crowd
at the Orpheum?

403
00:34:52.095 --> 00:34:54.351
Someone who knows
it wasn't your fault.

404
00:34:54.431 --> 00:34:57.896
Someone who knows Alfred Borden
and his repertoire of exotic knots.

405
00:34:57.976 --> 00:35:01.525
I hear he had a spot of bad luck
catching a bullet south of the river.

406
00:35:01.605 --> 00:35:04.224
That's a dangerous trick, that one.

407
00:35:09.738 --> 00:35:11.577
We'll have to whitewash the windows...

408
00:35:11.657 --> 00:35:16.278
confound the more curious members
of the public, but it will do.

409
00:35:17.704 --> 00:35:20.824
- We should see about an assistant.
- I've made some arrangements.

410
00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:24.298
Have you settled on a name?

411
00:35:24.378 --> 00:35:27.885
Yes, I have. The Great Danton.

412
00:35:27.965 --> 00:35:30.667
It's a bit old-fashioned, isn't it?

413
00:35:31.969 --> 00:35:34.224
No, it's sophisticated.

414
00:35:34.304 --> 00:35:36.810
The birdcage can't be our climax.
Everybody knows it.

415
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.521
- Not like this they don't.
- I don't wanna kill doves.

416
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:43.233
Then stay off the stage.
You're a magician, not a wizard.

417
00:35:43.313 --> 00:35:47.350
You gotta get your hands dirty
if you're gonna achieve the impossible.

418
00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.033
In here, Miss Wenscombe.

419
00:35:51.113 --> 00:35:54.578
No point in you meeting Mr. Angier
if you don't fit.

420
00:35:54.658 --> 00:35:56.818
On the right.

421
00:35:58.662 --> 00:35:59.958
What's so hard about this?

422
00:36:00.038 --> 00:36:03.492
Nothing. But you're going down here.

423
00:36:05.544 --> 00:36:09.092
Hold it. Hold it there.
This has gotta go around there.

424
00:36:09.172 --> 00:36:11.345
- And this will conceal it?
- Yeah, oh, sure.

425
00:36:11.425 --> 00:36:12.596
- All right?
- Yeah.

426
00:36:12.676 --> 00:36:15.390
- Now, take that one there.
- Yep. Okay.

427
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:18.018
- Pin this under.
- And this ties up here?

428
00:36:18.098 --> 00:36:20.091
- That ties at the front.
- That's good.

429
00:36:26.106 --> 00:36:29.059
Breathe as little as possible.

430
00:36:34.573 --> 00:36:37.454
Now, you see? That'll go. That'll flatten.

431
00:36:37.534 --> 00:36:39.027
- I see. Yeah.
- Okay.

432
00:36:42.289 --> 00:36:46.296
She's not experienced,
but she knows how to present herself.

433
00:36:46.376 --> 00:36:50.831
A pretty assistant is the most
effective form of misdirection.

434
00:36:51.173 --> 00:36:52.261
Thank you.

435
00:36:52.341 --> 00:36:54.429
Ladies and gentlemen,
for my final trick...

436
00:36:54.509 --> 00:36:57.266
I will require the assistance
of two volunteers.

437
00:36:57.346 --> 00:36:59.881
Mr. Merrit, if you would oblige me?

438
00:37:01.475 --> 00:37:04.845
Yeah. Okay. Bring your hand around.

439
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.596
- Under?
- Under, yeah.

440
00:37:07.147 --> 00:37:09.444
There. I put it around its foot.

441
00:37:09.524 --> 00:37:11.560
- Careful.
- He's all right, ain't he?

442
00:37:31.755 --> 00:37:34.678
- You get a volunteer to put a hand there.
- Yeah.

443
00:37:34.758 --> 00:37:35.887
And another one there.

444
00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:39.725
Mr. Merrit, if you'll place your hands
on either side of the cage, please.

445
00:37:39.805 --> 00:37:40.892
Thank you, Olivia.

446
00:37:40.972 --> 00:37:42.853
You best not be intending...

447
00:37:42.933 --> 00:37:45.522
- to hurt this animal, Mr. Angier.
- Of course not.

448
00:37:45.602 --> 00:37:47.899
You ready? All right.

449
00:37:47.979 --> 00:37:49.651
One...

450
00:37:49.731 --> 00:37:51.361
Two...

451
00:37:51.441 --> 00:37:53.810
- Three.
- Three. Go.

452
00:37:56.738 --> 00:37:58.648
Well, that's bloody marvelous,
Cutter.

453
00:37:59.658 --> 00:38:00.746
Very nice.

454
00:38:00.826 --> 00:38:03.153
And the best part is...

455
00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:10.464
I thought you said
I had to get my hands dirty.

456
00:38:10.544 --> 00:38:14.051
Someday perhaps you will.
I just had to know that you can.

457
00:38:14.131 --> 00:38:16.928
- Very nice. Very nice, indeed.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

458
00:38:17.008 --> 00:38:19.931
I haven't had the chance
to compliment your beautiful theater.

459
00:38:20.011 --> 00:38:22.434
Well, it'll be a lot more beautiful
when it's full.

460
00:38:22.514 --> 00:38:24.436
- Don't worry.
- Oh, you all say that.

461
00:38:24.516 --> 00:38:28.398
Why should I worry? If your tricks
don't get them in, somebody else's will.

462
00:38:28.478 --> 00:38:32.736
Maybe somebody willing to do
a bullet catch or a water escape?

463
00:38:32.816 --> 00:38:34.279
Cheap thrills, Mr. Merrit.

464
00:38:34.359 --> 00:38:38.075
People hoping for an accident,
likely to see one too.

465
00:38:38.155 --> 00:38:40.899
What would that do for your business?

466
00:38:41.658 --> 00:38:44.319
- You got a week, John.
- Thank you, Mr. Merrit.

467
00:38:54.504 --> 00:38:56.706
Thank you.

468
00:38:58.633 --> 00:39:01.264
Sir? In the third row there.

469
00:39:01.344 --> 00:39:04.381
Please stand up
and show us your handkerchief.

470
00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:07.896
This isn't mine.

471
00:39:07.976 --> 00:39:11.149
Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it
to the lady in the aisle.

472
00:39:11.229 --> 00:39:12.722
I believe she has yours.

473
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:17.936
Thank you.

474
00:39:19.905 --> 00:39:22.411
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm making so many mistakes.

475
00:39:22.491 --> 00:39:24.526
I'm so nervous.

476
00:39:24.993 --> 00:39:27.124
The audience doesn't seem
to be responding.

477
00:39:27.204 --> 00:39:32.200
They've seen a lot of tricks before,
but not this next one.

478
00:39:40.759 --> 00:39:43.056
Put a cloth over.

479
00:39:43.136 --> 00:39:46.131
- Fingers crossed.
- I'll have the champagne ready.

480
00:40:01.822 --> 00:40:04.327
- You've seen this one before?
- We've seen them all.

481
00:40:04.407 --> 00:40:06.913
I'll make it a little harder then, shall I?

482
00:40:06.993 --> 00:40:12.615
Two volunteers, please. A lady
and a gentleman to hold this cage with me.

483
00:40:13.083 --> 00:40:16.882
I'll perform this feat in a manner
never before seen by yourselves...

484
00:40:16.962 --> 00:40:19.998
or any other audience
anywhere in the world.

485
00:40:22.425 --> 00:40:26.600
Madam, if you'll place one hand on the back
of the cage, one hand on the front.

486
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.759
Sir, one hand on the bottom of the cage,
one hand on the top.

487
00:40:44.114 --> 00:40:46.828
- Should have spotted him.
- You had a lot of plates going.

488
00:40:46.908 --> 00:40:48.652
Don't suppose they'll
let us do this again.

489
00:40:48.732 --> 00:40:49.347
No.

490
00:40:49.427 --> 00:40:51.346
So, what's the climax of our show?

491
00:40:51.426 --> 00:40:53.210
Show? You don't have a show.

492
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.003
We have a week's engagement.

493
00:40:55.083 --> 00:40:58.799
To perform magic, not butcher birds
and break my customers' fingers.

494
00:40:58.879 --> 00:41:01.384
Clear out. Anything here
in the morning gets burned.

495
00:41:01.464 --> 00:41:03.887
- Mr. Merrit--
- It's done, John.

496
00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:07.837
I've hired a comedian.
You know I hate comedians.

497
00:41:09.139 --> 00:41:11.394
Well, there's plenty of good theaters.

498
00:41:11.474 --> 00:41:15.565
If we can come up with a new trick,
change the name of the act--

499
00:41:15.645 --> 00:41:17.722
The name stays.

500
00:41:19.482 --> 00:41:24.574
Right. Well, then the new trick's
gonna have to be irresistible, then.

501
00:41:24.654 --> 00:41:26.535
I have a couple of methods to try out.

502
00:41:26.615 --> 00:41:29.996
And then we need a new angle
on the presentation.

503
00:41:30.076 --> 00:41:31.957
Oh, and if you need some inspiration...

504
00:41:32.037 --> 00:41:35.126
there's a technical exposition
at the Albert Hall this week.

505
00:41:35.206 --> 00:41:37.963
Engineers, scientists, you know?

506
00:41:38.043 --> 00:41:41.412
That sort of thing
captures a public's imagination.

507
00:41:58.355 --> 00:42:01.778
Mind if I join you? Tesla sends me
down here during the storms.

508
00:42:01.858 --> 00:42:05.186
Perfect excuse to come join
the Great Danton for a drink.

509
00:42:06.196 --> 00:42:08.189
Two of them.

510
00:42:08.531 --> 00:42:11.121
Beautiful, isn't it, huh?
God, I miss New York though.

511
00:42:11.201 --> 00:42:13.665
- So why are you here?
- The lightning lives here.

512
00:42:13.745 --> 00:42:17.073
And not much else. Our work is secret.

513
00:42:17.624 --> 00:42:19.576
Is that a cipher?

514
00:42:21.586 --> 00:42:24.634
It's a rotating transposition
that shifts every day of the diary.

515
00:42:24.714 --> 00:42:28.680
Simple, but time-consuming to translate,
even when you have the five-letter keyword.

516
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.599
Which is?

517
00:42:30.679 --> 00:42:32.642
We magicians have a circle of trust.

518
00:42:32.722 --> 00:42:36.771
You have a circle of trust
with someone whose diary you stole?

519
00:42:36.851 --> 00:42:38.094
Maybe I bought it.

520
00:42:38.728 --> 00:42:41.484
And you're hoping to find
a great secret in there.

521
00:42:41.564 --> 00:42:45.435
I've already found it.
That's why I'm here.

522
00:42:51.574 --> 00:42:54.623
Tesla built one for another magician.

523
00:42:54.703 --> 00:42:58.156
- Why would you want the same thing?
- Call it a professional rivalry.

524
00:42:58.498 --> 00:43:02.923
Mr. Tesla has built unusual machines
for unusual people.

525
00:43:03.003 --> 00:43:04.633
But he would never talk about it.

526
00:43:04.713 --> 00:43:07.832
I understand discretion.
I just want the machine.

527
00:43:10.927 --> 00:43:13.046
Finish your drink.

528
00:43:13.847 --> 00:43:15.268
I wanna show you something.

529
00:43:15.348 --> 00:43:18.688
I think you'll have a special appreciation
for our work.

530
00:43:18.768 --> 00:43:22.233
- I thought it was a secret.
- You're a magician.

531
00:43:22.313 --> 00:43:24.182
Who's gonna believe you?

532
00:43:25.275 --> 00:43:27.405
Not long now.

533
00:43:27.485 --> 00:43:29.991
Our equipment requires
a great deal of current.

534
00:43:30.071 --> 00:43:34.108
Tesla electrified the town in exchange
for using the generators when we need to.

535
00:43:36.119 --> 00:43:39.250
We do our tests
when the townspeople are asleep.

536
00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.158
Mr. Tesla doesn't wanna scare anyone.

537
00:43:59.934 --> 00:44:02.011
Where are the wires?

538
00:44:03.313 --> 00:44:04.681
Exactly.

539
00:44:13.782 --> 00:44:17.956
- Where's the generator?
- You saw it last week.

540
00:44:18.036 --> 00:44:21.084
- That must be 10 miles from here.
- Fifteen.

541
00:44:21.164 --> 00:44:24.659
And I have to ride all of them
before I get to bed.

542
00:44:25.335 --> 00:44:28.204
I'll send word for you
in a few days, Mr. Angier.

543
00:44:28.379 --> 00:44:32.262
<i>Magic. Real magic.</i>

544
00:44:32.342 --> 00:44:36.391
Now appearing only here
at London's Royal Albert Hall.

545
00:44:36.471 --> 00:44:38.768
One of the miracles of our age.

546
00:44:38.848 --> 00:44:41.062
A technological marvel.

547
00:44:41.142 --> 00:44:43.440
You've never seen anything like it
in your lives.

548
00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.984
Your eyes will not believe
what they're witnessing.

549
00:44:46.064 --> 00:44:49.237
The miracle of Nikola Tesla,
ladies and gentlemen.

550
00:44:49.317 --> 00:44:51.781
Free clean power.
Would you like to know the future?

551
00:44:51.861 --> 00:44:54.284
The man speaking now
is going to change the world.

552
00:44:54.364 --> 00:44:59.402
Ladies and gentlemen, come one, come all.
Immediate seating, no waiting.

553
00:45:14.509 --> 00:45:17.724
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry...

554
00:45:17.804 --> 00:45:19.642
but objections have been raised...

555
00:45:19.722 --> 00:45:20.946
concerning the safety...

556
00:45:21.026 --> 00:45:23.188
They should be.
Does that look safe to you?

557
00:45:23.268 --> 00:45:25.774
Part of Thomas Edison's
smear campaign...

558
00:45:25.854 --> 00:45:29.819
against Mr. Tesla's
superior alternating current.

559
00:45:29.899 --> 00:45:31.529
Mr. Alley, please.

560
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:34.199
We have asked Mr. Tesla
to reconsider...

561
00:45:34.279 --> 00:45:36.993
- Which he will not.
- his presentation.

562
00:45:37.073 --> 00:45:41.486
But I've been told he refuses
to appear under any such restrictions.

563
00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.834
Clear the hall!
This thing is gonna blow!

564
00:45:44.914 --> 00:45:47.742
- Clear the hall!
- Ladies and gentlemen, please!

565
00:45:48.209 --> 00:45:50.453
Where's the switch?

566
00:45:53.965 --> 00:45:56.626
This is all perfectly safe.

567
00:46:27.373 --> 00:46:28.503
Hey.

568
00:46:28.583 --> 00:46:30.213
Hello, you.

569
00:46:30.293 --> 00:46:33.287
Hello, Jess.

570
00:46:35.465 --> 00:46:38.459
Have you had a nice day with Mummy?

571
00:46:40.345 --> 00:46:43.560
Sarah, I love you.

572
00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:47.105
- See? Today it's true.
- Yeah.

573
00:46:47.185 --> 00:46:49.053
Hello.

574
00:46:49.896 --> 00:46:52.390
<i>I saw happiness.</i>

575
00:46:52.523 --> 00:46:55.572
<i>Happiness that should have been mine.</i>

576
00:46:55.652 --> 00:46:57.073
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

577
00:46:57.153 --> 00:47:01.828
<i>His notebook reveals
that he never had the life that I envied.</i>

578
00:47:01.908 --> 00:47:04.330
<i>The family life
that he craves one minute...</i>

579
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.793
<i>he rails against the next,
demanding freedom.</i>

580
00:47:08.873 --> 00:47:11.838
<i>His mind...
His mind is a divided one.</i>

581
00:47:11.918 --> 00:47:13.840
<i>His soul is restless.</i>

582
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:20.034
<i>His wife and child tormented
by his fickle and contradictory nature.</i>

583
00:47:23.888 --> 00:47:26.394
What do you think?
What do you think you'll call her?

584
00:47:26.474 --> 00:47:27.812
I don't know.

585
00:47:27.892 --> 00:47:30.344
Everybody needs a name.
So, what's hers?

586
00:47:31.062 --> 00:47:33.014
Maybe Sarah.

587
00:47:35.108 --> 00:47:37.655
That's a lovely name.
That's a lovely name.

588
00:47:37.735 --> 00:47:40.950
You talk about what you wanna do
for the rest of the day.

589
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:43.024
All right? Go on. You talk with her.

590
00:47:45.368 --> 00:47:47.570
They're taking her away?

591
00:47:49.539 --> 00:47:50.740
To the workhouse?

592
00:47:53.793 --> 00:47:56.037
Now, you keep talking.

593
00:47:58.548 --> 00:48:01.918
Tell Owens I've reconsidered.
Take it. Go on, take it.

594
00:48:06.514 --> 00:48:08.758
It's for the best.

595
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:15.765
Let me see.

596
00:48:16.816 --> 00:48:21.812
- I'm gonna learn all the Professor's secrets.
- Only if I teach you how to read.

597
00:48:22.238 --> 00:48:24.535
They're just stupid tricks, right?

598
00:48:24.615 --> 00:48:27.610
Haven't helped you
get out of here, have they?

599
00:48:28.161 --> 00:48:31.614
Or can't you undo real locks, Professor?

600
00:48:32.623 --> 00:48:35.380
Well, maybe I'm just biding my time.

601
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:41.386
Maybe one day I'll open my hand,
get your attention, ask:

602
00:48:41.466 --> 00:48:43.638
"Are you watching closely?"

603
00:48:43.718 --> 00:48:46.671
Maybe a magic word or two.

604
00:48:48.389 --> 00:48:51.050
And then I'll be gone.

605
00:48:54.103 --> 00:48:57.557
How'd you get so famous, then, eh?

606
00:48:57.857 --> 00:48:59.684
Magic.

607
00:49:03.363 --> 00:49:04.867
Borden, get back here!

608
00:49:04.947 --> 00:49:06.649
Thank you.

609
00:49:07.075 --> 00:49:09.527
Shut up! Get him down!

610
00:49:09.827 --> 00:49:11.958
Thank you.

611
00:49:12.038 --> 00:49:14.115
Who's got a bloody key?

612
00:49:20.505 --> 00:49:23.094
<i>February 8th, 1899.</i>

613
00:49:23.174 --> 00:49:25.334
<i>Today, finally a breakthrough.</i>

614
00:49:25.802 --> 00:49:28.170
<i>Tesla's agreed to see me.</i>

615
00:49:35.728 --> 00:49:37.013
It's perfectly safe.

616
00:49:58.918 --> 00:50:02.091
So this is the Great Danton.

617
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:07.043
Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me
on any number of occasions.

618
00:50:08.719 --> 00:50:10.379
Hold out other hand.

619
00:50:18.896 --> 00:50:20.818
What's conducting the electricity?

620
00:50:20.898 --> 00:50:24.280
Our bodies, Mr. Angier,
are quite capable of conducting...

621
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.063
and, indeed, producing energy.

622
00:50:28.448 --> 00:50:30.691
Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?

623
00:50:33.536 --> 00:50:35.738
I need something impossible.

624
00:50:37.373 --> 00:50:42.286
You are familiar with the phrase,
"Man's reach exceeds his grasp"?

625
00:50:42.628 --> 00:50:43.966
It's a lie.

626
00:50:44.046 --> 00:50:46.207
Man's grasp exceeds his nerve.

627
00:50:47.133 --> 00:50:50.252
Society only tolerates
one change at a time.

628
00:50:51.554 --> 00:50:54.852
The first time
I tried to change the world...

629
00:50:54.932 --> 00:50:56.759
I was hailed as a visionary.

630
00:50:57.185 --> 00:51:02.890
Second time,
I was asked politely to retire.

631
00:51:03.566 --> 00:51:06.852
So here I am, enjoying my retirement.

632
00:51:07.195 --> 00:51:09.158
Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier.

633
00:51:09.238 --> 00:51:11.148
What you want is simply expensive.

634
00:51:11.574 --> 00:51:13.663
If I were to build for you this machine...

635
00:51:13.743 --> 00:51:16.499
you would be presenting it
merely as illusion?

636
00:51:16.579 --> 00:51:20.002
Well, if people actually believed
the things I did on-stage...

637
00:51:20.082 --> 00:51:23.798
they wouldn't clap, they'd scream.
I mean, think of sawing a woman in half.

638
00:51:23.878 --> 00:51:26.843
Mr. Angier, have you considered
the cost of such a machine?

639
00:51:26.923 --> 00:51:28.958
Price is not an object.

640
00:51:29.425 --> 00:51:32.962
Perhaps not,
but have you considered the cost?

641
00:51:33.804 --> 00:51:35.297
I'm not sure I follow.

642
00:51:36.182 --> 00:51:38.175
Go home. Forget this thing.

643
00:51:38.434 --> 00:51:40.469
I can recognize an obsession.

644
00:51:40.895 --> 00:51:42.525
No good will come of it.

645
00:51:42.605 --> 00:51:44.598
Hasn't good come of your obsessions?

646
00:51:45.066 --> 00:51:47.738
At first.
But I have followed them too long.

647
00:51:47.818 --> 00:51:53.482
I am their slave, and one day,
they will choose to destroy me.

648
00:51:54.825 --> 00:51:58.821
If you understand an obsession,
then you know you won't change my mind.

649
00:51:59.956 --> 00:52:01.157
So be it.

650
00:52:02.583 --> 00:52:03.993
Will you build it?

651
00:52:04.835 --> 00:52:08.426
I have already begun to build it,
Mr. Angier.

652
00:52:08.506 --> 00:52:10.970
I hope you enjoy the mountain air.

653
00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:13.586
This will take some time.

654
00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:39.487
I thought you'd gone.

655
00:52:40.246 --> 00:52:42.615
I don't really have anywhere to go.

656
00:52:45.293 --> 00:52:46.631
You've been sleeping here?

657
00:52:46.711 --> 00:52:50.107
Cutter said it would be all right
till we get another booking.

658
00:52:50.187 --> 00:52:51.341
What are you doing?

659
00:52:52.174 --> 00:52:53.596
Research.

660
00:52:53.676 --> 00:52:58.226
Part of a magician's job is to watch
his competition, to see what illusions--

661
00:52:58.306 --> 00:53:01.145
You're going to do something
to that man, aren't you?

662
00:53:01.225 --> 00:53:03.105
Cutter's hoping you'll let things lie.

663
00:53:03.185 --> 00:53:05.942
He says if Borden thinks things
are even between you two--

664
00:53:06.022 --> 00:53:07.598
Even?

665
00:53:07.982 --> 00:53:10.613
My wife for a couple of his fingers?

666
00:53:10.693 --> 00:53:13.658
He has a family now, right?
And he's performing again.

667
00:53:13.738 --> 00:53:17.578
Borden is living his life just as he always
intended, as if nothing had happened.

668
00:53:17.658 --> 00:53:19.789
And look at-- Look at me, all right?

669
00:53:19.869 --> 00:53:22.947
- I'm alone and no theater will touch me.
- Us.

670
00:53:23.706 --> 00:53:26.575
You're going to need a better disguise.

671
00:53:43.517 --> 00:53:44.760
Need a volunteer.

672
00:53:45.978 --> 00:53:47.471
<i>What happened?</i>

673
00:53:48.397 --> 00:53:50.641
Did you hurt him?

674
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:53.561
What happened, Robert?

675
00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.398
You, sir.

676
00:53:57.907 --> 00:54:00.830
Just a rubber ball, yes? Thank you.

677
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:03.499
Just a rubber ball, no.

678
00:54:03.579 --> 00:54:06.836
Not normal. Not a normal rubber ball.

679
00:54:06.916 --> 00:54:08.158
It's magic.

680
00:54:08.793 --> 00:54:10.953
He had a new trick.

681
00:54:24.642 --> 00:54:25.843
<i>Was it good?</i>

682
00:54:30.773 --> 00:54:33.392
It was the greatest magic trick
I've ever seen.

683
00:54:39.281 --> 00:54:40.870
<i>Did they applaud when you saw it?</i>

684
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:43.080
The trick was too good,
it was too simple.

685
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.334
- The audience hardly had time to see it.
- He's a dreadful magician.

686
00:54:46.414 --> 00:54:49.045
No, he's a wonderful magician.
He's a dreadful showman.

687
00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:51.422
He doesn't know how to dress it up,
how to sell--

688
00:54:51.502 --> 00:54:53.215
- How does he do it?
- Uses a double.

689
00:54:53.295 --> 00:54:56.010
No, no, no, it's too simple.
This is a complex illusion.

690
00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.554
You only say that
because you don't know the method.

691
00:54:58.634 --> 00:55:00.890
It's a double at the end.
It's the only way.

692
00:55:00.970 --> 00:55:03.225
I've seen him perform the trick
three times now.

693
00:55:03.305 --> 00:55:05.895
- The Prestige is the same man.
- No, it's not.

694
00:55:05.975 --> 00:55:08.522
The same man comes out
of that second cabinet.

695
00:55:08.602 --> 00:55:09.887
It's the same man.

696
00:55:10.938 --> 00:55:13.402
He wears padded gloves
to hide his damaged fingers...

697
00:55:13.482 --> 00:55:15.559
but if you look closely you can tell.

698
00:55:18.154 --> 00:55:20.868
He doesn't know how to sell it
to an audience, but I do.

699
00:55:20.948 --> 00:55:23.484
Yeah, well, we can use it
as a climax to the show.

700
00:55:23.701 --> 00:55:25.665
Yes.

701
00:55:25.745 --> 00:55:29.085
The man stole my life,
I'm gonna steal his trick.

702
00:55:29.165 --> 00:55:32.421
- We gotta find someone who looks like you.
- He doesn't use a double.

703
00:55:32.501 --> 00:55:35.925
Robert, I don't know
how Borden does the trick, so either--

704
00:55:36.005 --> 00:55:39.470
You either wait for him to retire
and buy the secret...

705
00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:41.430
or you listen to how I would do it.

706
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:46.590
And the only way that I know how to do it
is to find you a bloody good double.

707
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:49.176
All right.

708
00:55:50.227 --> 00:55:52.930
Take a good look.
Let's get out there and find me.

709
00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.059
Look. Look.

710
00:56:00.988 --> 00:56:02.773
What's that?

711
00:56:03.741 --> 00:56:06.956
That is for you.

712
00:56:07.036 --> 00:56:08.874
What's this for?

713
00:56:08.954 --> 00:56:10.781
Come here.

714
00:56:15.753 --> 00:56:19.635
- I asked you last week. You said you--
- You caught me in a wrong mood.

715
00:56:19.715 --> 00:56:21.137
But you went over all the--

716
00:56:21.217 --> 00:56:24.962
Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind,
aren't I?

717
00:56:25.262 --> 00:56:28.769
The act is taking off,
soon we'll be in a bigger theater.

718
00:56:28.849 --> 00:56:30.259
Things will work out.

719
00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.316
I can't believe it. Thank you.

720
00:56:34.396 --> 00:56:36.473
Thank you. It's beautiful.

721
00:56:42.988 --> 00:56:44.940
Gerry?

722
00:56:45.157 --> 00:56:46.245
Darling, look at you.

723
00:56:46.325 --> 00:56:49.278
Mr. Cutter, Mr. Angier,
I'd like you to meet Gerald Root.

724
00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:57.828
A pleasure.
Pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.

725
00:56:58.212 --> 00:57:02.291
Would you like for me
to tell you a little joke? Come here.

726
00:57:03.926 --> 00:57:06.015
There we are. Yes?

727
00:57:06.095 --> 00:57:08.297
Are you laughing now?

728
00:57:10.307 --> 00:57:13.302
Oh, dear, I have to take a piss.

729
00:57:14.812 --> 00:57:17.693
- He's out of his mind.
- Of course. He's an out-of-work actor.

730
00:57:17.773 --> 00:57:19.695
He's perfect. He needs a little help...

731
00:57:19.775 --> 00:57:22.698
but when I get done with him,
he could be your brother.

732
00:57:22.778 --> 00:57:25.367
I don't need him to be my brother,
I need him to be me.

733
00:57:25.447 --> 00:57:27.274
Give me a month.

734
00:57:30.953 --> 00:57:32.988
Come around.

735
00:57:33.956 --> 00:57:38.494
So you open the door and...

736
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:47.336
Come on.

737
00:57:51.015 --> 00:57:54.968
- Couldn't you have found a softer one?
- Well, it's not for sleeping on.

738
00:57:55.352 --> 00:57:57.513
So if you come down through there...

739
00:58:00.024 --> 00:58:03.227
- does Root go up through there?
- Yep.

740
00:58:03.444 --> 00:58:05.354
It's going to be amazing, Robert.

741
00:58:05.696 --> 00:58:09.691
Well, it has to be.
Borden's trick is getting noticed.

742
00:58:11.535 --> 00:58:14.113
The place was packed today.

743
00:58:15.581 --> 00:58:17.419
You went and saw his show again.

744
00:58:17.499 --> 00:58:20.035
Ready to meet yourself, Mr. Angier?

745
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:30.599
All I have to do is keep myself drunk...

746
00:58:30.679 --> 00:58:33.060
and no one will be able
to tell the difference.

747
00:58:33.140 --> 00:58:35.104
Have a little faith, sir.

748
00:58:35.184 --> 00:58:40.264
Now, would you favor us
with a performance, Mr. Root?

749
00:58:43.984 --> 00:58:45.602
Jesus.

750
00:59:00.793 --> 00:59:04.204
Yes, you would drink too
if you knew the world half as well as I do.

751
00:59:07.841 --> 00:59:09.471
Did you think you were unique?

752
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:12.141
I have been Caesar. I played Faust.

753
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:15.311
How difficult could it possibly be
to play the Great Danton?

754
00:59:15.391 --> 00:59:18.647
You can go back to being yourself now,
Root, for nothing.

755
00:59:18.727 --> 00:59:20.983
I'd rather be him for now.

756
00:59:21.063 --> 00:59:24.057
I find it amusing.

757
00:59:27.236 --> 00:59:31.523
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

758
00:59:32.449 --> 00:59:34.455
- You look wonderful.
- Oh, thank you.

759
00:59:34.535 --> 00:59:37.708
Root has to keep a low profile.
Anyone sees him, the game's up.

760
00:59:37.788 --> 00:59:40.878
I don't know how you do these things.
I'm not sure I wanna know.

761
00:59:40.958 --> 00:59:43.172
Have you thought
what we should call the trick?

762
00:59:43.252 --> 00:59:44.882
There's no point in being coy.

763
00:59:44.962 --> 00:59:47.247
Borden calls his trick
"The Transported Man."

764
00:59:51.343 --> 00:59:54.016
Ladies and gentlemen,
much of what you've seen tonight...

765
00:59:54.096 --> 00:59:59.551
may be termed as illusions
or entertaining trifles.

766
01:00:02.938 --> 01:00:04.306
Alas...

767
01:00:06.275 --> 01:00:08.936
I cannot claim
this next feat as illusion.

768
01:00:09.611 --> 01:00:10.979
Watch carefully.

769
01:00:12.281 --> 01:00:14.942
You'll see no trickery...

770
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.985
for no trickery is employed.

771
01:00:17.953 --> 01:00:21.377
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient...

772
01:00:21.457 --> 01:00:23.825
and various holy men
of the Himalayas.

773
01:00:27.087 --> 01:00:29.885
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique...

774
01:00:29.965 --> 01:00:33.097
but for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

775
01:00:33.177 --> 01:00:36.463
what you're about to see
is considered safe.

776
01:01:08.253 --> 01:01:10.539
To our achievement.

777
01:01:11.006 --> 01:01:13.762
The manager says
he's never seen a reaction like it.

778
01:01:13.842 --> 01:01:17.141
At least he got to see it.
I spent the ovation hiding under the stage.

779
01:01:17.221 --> 01:01:19.727
No one cares about the man
who disappears into the box.

780
01:01:19.807 --> 01:01:21.645
They care about the one who comes out.

781
01:01:21.725 --> 01:01:24.606
- I care about the man in the box.
- Thank you.

782
01:01:24.686 --> 01:01:28.110
I don't know. Maybe--
Maybe we could switch before the trick.

783
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.446
I could be the Prestige
and Root ends up below.

784
01:01:30.526 --> 01:01:33.282
No, the anticipation of the trick
is everything.

785
01:01:33.362 --> 01:01:36.493
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

786
01:01:36.573 --> 01:01:39.955
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

787
01:01:40.035 --> 01:01:42.958
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

788
01:01:43.038 --> 01:01:46.628
Root, you bloody fool.
Get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

789
01:01:46.708 --> 01:01:49.298
Anyone could walk in here at any minute.

790
01:01:49.378 --> 01:01:51.580
Congratulations, all.

791
01:01:51.713 --> 01:01:55.220
Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
We worked hard.

792
01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.085
We need to celebrate properly.

793
01:02:00.556 --> 01:02:03.187
What's wrong? Is it your wife?

794
01:02:03.267 --> 01:02:05.606
No. No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

795
01:02:05.686 --> 01:02:08.984
Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours.
He has no style.

796
01:02:09.064 --> 01:02:12.988
Well, he doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

797
01:02:13.068 --> 01:02:14.823
I need to know how he does it.

798
01:02:14.903 --> 01:02:18.482
- Why?
- So I can do it better.

799
01:02:20.492 --> 01:02:22.611
I need you to go and work for him.

800
01:02:26.039 --> 01:02:27.908
Work for him? Are you joking?

801
01:02:29.001 --> 01:02:30.214
You'll be my spy.

802
01:02:30.294 --> 01:02:32.466
We just got our start.
You want me to leave?

803
01:02:32.546 --> 01:02:34.676
That's how we advance.
Think of it, Olivia.

804
01:02:34.756 --> 01:02:38.472
We got people excited, but imagine
what we could do with the real illusion.

805
01:02:38.552 --> 01:02:42.476
We'd have the greatest magic act
anyone's ever seen.

806
01:02:42.556 --> 01:02:44.019
He knows I work for you.

807
01:02:44.099 --> 01:02:47.481
Exactly why he'll wanna hire you.
He'll want my secret.

808
01:02:47.561 --> 01:02:51.807
- Why would he trust me?
- Because you're gonna tell him the truth.

809
01:03:03.994 --> 01:03:05.195
Good girl.

810
01:03:08.248 --> 01:03:11.952
You must be curious to see what
so much money has bought you, Mr. Angier.

811
01:03:12.377 --> 01:03:15.342
It's fitting you should be here
for maiden voyage.

812
01:03:15.422 --> 01:03:17.332
Your hat.

813
01:03:25.265 --> 01:03:27.676
You might wanna stand back.

814
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.418
I don't understand.

815
01:03:49.498 --> 01:03:51.879
Perhaps it would be best
if you left us to it.

816
01:03:51.959 --> 01:03:54.173
- Is there a problem, Mr. Tesla?
- No, no, no.

817
01:03:54.253 --> 01:03:55.883
- Come back next week.
- Next week?

818
01:03:55.963 --> 01:03:58.135
- Come back-- Next week, it'll be fine.
- Tesla.

819
01:03:58.215 --> 01:04:01.209
She's just a little temperamental
sometimes.

820
01:04:05.889 --> 01:04:08.770
- Interesting workshop.
- Yeah, we make do.

821
01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:11.273
- My name is Olivia Wensoombe--
- I know who you are.

822
01:04:11.353 --> 01:04:12.774
You here to steal my show?

823
01:04:12.854 --> 01:04:14.735
I'm here to give it what it's missing.

824
01:04:14.815 --> 01:04:18.185
- Yeah? What might that be?
- Me.

825
01:04:19.528 --> 01:04:23.577
I was just saying that, wasn't I, Bernard?
Woman's touch.

826
01:04:23.657 --> 01:04:25.579
- I've left Angier.
- All right.

827
01:04:25.659 --> 01:04:28.457
- I want a job.
- Yeah?

828
01:04:28.537 --> 01:04:31.627
- I know you've no reason to trust me--
- Why wouldn't I trust you?

829
01:04:31.707 --> 01:04:35.744
I mean, you're only the mistress
of my enemy. Why wouldn't I trust you?

830
01:04:37.129 --> 01:04:39.247
- Mr. Borden--
- Alfred.

831
01:04:41.466 --> 01:04:43.138
I'm going to tell you the truth.

832
01:04:43.218 --> 01:04:46.475
Now that is a slippery notion
in our line of work...

833
01:04:46.555 --> 01:04:48.048
isn't it, Miss Wenscombe?

834
01:04:49.975 --> 01:04:52.648
I am here because he sent me here.

835
01:04:52.728 --> 01:04:55.275
He wants me to work for you
and steal your secret.

836
01:04:55.355 --> 01:04:57.110
What does he need my secret for?

837
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:58.767
His trick is top-notch.

838
01:04:59.192 --> 01:05:02.491
He vanishes and then he reappears
on the other side of the stage...

839
01:05:02.571 --> 01:05:06.495
mute, overweight and,
unless I'm mistaken, very drunk.

840
01:05:06.575 --> 01:05:08.443
It's astonishing. How does he do it?

841
01:05:08.702 --> 01:05:13.669
And tell me, Olivia, does he enjoy
taking his bows under the stage?

842
01:05:13.749 --> 01:05:14.836
No, it's killing him.

843
01:05:14.916 --> 01:05:17.005
He's obsessed
with discovering your methods.

844
01:05:17.085 --> 01:05:18.382
He thinks of nothing else.

845
01:05:18.462 --> 01:05:21.635
He takes no pleasure in our success,
and I've had enough.

846
01:05:21.715 --> 01:05:23.333
There is no future with him.

847
01:05:25.344 --> 01:05:29.172
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

848
01:05:29.473 --> 01:05:33.260
This is the truth, is it?

849
01:05:37.564 --> 01:05:39.361
Think you'd better get dressed, sir.

850
01:05:39.441 --> 01:05:41.738
Root, you're late
and more drunk than usual.

851
01:05:41.818 --> 01:05:44.646
- Now, get down below stairs right away.
- No.

852
01:05:46.031 --> 01:05:49.204
No, we need to have
a little chat, Mr. Cutter.

853
01:05:49.284 --> 01:05:50.414
We have a problem.

854
01:05:50.494 --> 01:05:53.166
Cutter, Borden is performing
right across the street.

855
01:05:53.246 --> 01:05:56.074
Yeah? We have a bigger problem.

856
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.161
Root. He's realized
he can make demands.

857
01:06:00.796 --> 01:06:02.217
Wha--? He's blackmailing us?

858
01:06:02.297 --> 01:06:04.222
I was surprised,
to tell you the truth.

859
01:06:04.302 --> 01:06:06.555
It usually takes them longer
to figure it out.

860
01:06:06.635 --> 01:06:09.516
- Well, how much does he want?
- Well, it makes no difference.

861
01:06:09.596 --> 01:06:13.061
- We gotta stop doing the trick.
- Stop the trick? Cutter, look at this.

862
01:06:13.141 --> 01:06:15.397
Well, look at yesterday's,
look at last week...

863
01:06:15.477 --> 01:06:18.900
where they said you were
the premier stage performer in London.

864
01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.652
Not magician, mind you.

865
01:06:20.732 --> 01:06:23.405
- Performer of any kind.
- Well, what's your point?

866
01:06:23.485 --> 01:06:25.866
My point is, Robert,
is you've climbed too high...

867
01:06:25.946 --> 01:06:28.356
to get away
with professional embarrassment.

868
01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.735
We don't do any tricks we can't control.

869
01:06:33.745 --> 01:06:35.625
Just pay him whatever he wants for now.

870
01:06:35.705 --> 01:06:39.326
We keep doing the trick until Borden opens
and then we'll phase it out.

871
01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:41.870
All right.

872
01:06:44.339 --> 01:06:48.543
<i>Cutter was always surprised
how fast Root turned bad.</i>

873
01:06:48.927 --> 01:06:53.018
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this rather welcome pint of ale?

874
01:06:53.098 --> 01:06:56.563
You're the Great Danton, aren't you?

875
01:06:56.643 --> 01:07:00.067
Of course I am, but don't advertise it
because I'll be mobbed with fans.

876
01:07:00.147 --> 01:07:02.110
<i>We paid him enough
to keep him in beers...</i>

877
01:07:02.190 --> 01:07:04.446
<i>so you wouldn't expect him
to rock the boat.</i>

878
01:07:04.526 --> 01:07:07.157
Indeed, many of you
may be familiar with this technique.

879
01:07:07.237 --> 01:07:10.952
But for those of you who aren't,
do not be alarmed...

880
01:07:11.032 --> 01:07:14.164
what you're about to see
is considered safe.

881
01:07:14.244 --> 01:07:15.624
And who are you?

882
01:07:15.704 --> 01:07:21.630
I am a humble admirer
and a fellow practitioner.

883
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:23.078
Very good.

884
01:07:32.387 --> 01:07:35.143
- Another?
- Oh, if you insist.

885
01:07:35.223 --> 01:07:37.229
- Another.
- I'm not performing tonight.

886
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:39.147
Well, I'm only doing one show...

887
01:07:39.227 --> 01:07:42.484
but to be frank, my people
pretty much run things these days.

888
01:07:42.564 --> 01:07:43.890
Get up there!

889
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:46.238
Get up!

890
01:07:46.318 --> 01:07:48.573
Your illusion, The Transported Man...

891
01:07:48.653 --> 01:07:51.815
I'm not claiming
to know your methods or anything...

892
01:07:52.324 --> 01:07:58.024
but I had a similar trick in my act,
and I used a double.

893
01:08:00.207 --> 01:08:01.378
I see. Very good.

894
01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:04.131
Well, it was, and then it went bad.

895
01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:09.678
What I didn't count on, was that when I
incorporated this bloke into my act...

896
01:08:09.758 --> 01:08:11.960
he had complete power over me.

897
01:08:13.094 --> 01:08:14.754
Complete power, you say.

898
01:08:32.113 --> 01:08:37.485
Be very careful giving someone
that power over you.

899
01:08:39.663 --> 01:08:41.710
Well, thank you.

900
01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:44.284
Yes, thank you for the warning.

901
01:08:46.253 --> 01:08:48.455
Cheers.

902
01:08:48.964 --> 01:08:51.052
I cannot claim this next feat as illusion.

903
01:08:51.132 --> 01:08:55.545
What you're about to see
is considered safe.

904
01:09:35.343 --> 01:09:37.754
The Great Danton.

905
01:09:43.935 --> 01:09:45.690
I apologize.

906
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:49.611
There simply is too much magic...

907
01:09:49.691 --> 01:09:54.896
for my stage at the Pantages
across the street.

908
01:09:56.031 --> 01:09:58.662
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

909
01:09:58.742 --> 01:10:02.362
Pardon my intrusion.

910
01:10:02.829 --> 01:10:05.752
- Bravo!
- And go easy on the poor chap.

911
01:10:05.832 --> 01:10:09.118
He does try so very hard.

912
01:10:11.546 --> 01:10:13.468
I don't know how Borden found him.

913
01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:15.303
Kept him under wraps, I was careful.

914
01:10:15.383 --> 01:10:17.627
Yeah, well, he did.

915
01:10:18.261 --> 01:10:19.587
Do you think it was her?

916
01:10:26.811 --> 01:10:29.526
You weren't expecting me?

917
01:10:29.606 --> 01:10:32.362
I was expecting you sooner.
Your message said afternoon.

918
01:10:32.442 --> 01:10:34.769
It takes a bit
for me to get around these days.

919
01:10:34.903 --> 01:10:36.658
He's taken everything from me.

920
01:10:36.738 --> 01:10:39.494
My wife, my career, now you.

921
01:10:39.574 --> 01:10:41.037
What do you mean?
You sent me--

922
01:10:41.117 --> 01:10:43.873
I sent you to steal his secret,
not to improve his act.

923
01:10:43.953 --> 01:10:45.500
- That's my job.
- Or fall in love.

924
01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:48.253
- I did everything you asked!
- Yes? Yes?

925
01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:50.964
- Then how does he do it?
- Cutter was right, a double.

926
01:10:51.044 --> 01:10:54.384
- Of course Borden said that.
- He didn't say anything. I've seen things.

927
01:10:54.464 --> 01:10:58.346
Makeup, glasses, wigs. We don't use it
for the show, but I've seen it backstage.

928
01:10:58.426 --> 01:11:02.225
It's misdirection. He leaves things around
to make you think he's using a double.

929
01:11:02.305 --> 01:11:04.311
All the time'?
He doesn't know when I look.

930
01:11:04.391 --> 01:11:06.354
All the time, Olivia!

931
01:11:06.434 --> 01:11:08.857
That's who he is! That's what it takes!

932
01:11:08.937 --> 01:11:11.472
He lives his act! Don't you see?

933
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:16.698
Just because you're sleeping with him
doesn't mean he trusts you.

934
01:11:16.778 --> 01:11:19.200
You think you can see everything,
don't you?

935
01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.151
But the Great Danton is a blind fool.
His notebook.

936
01:11:24.994 --> 01:11:27.208
You stole it?

937
01:11:27.288 --> 01:11:29.169
I borrowed it for tonight.

938
01:11:29.249 --> 01:11:31.296
I thought you could translate it,
but now--

939
01:11:31.376 --> 01:11:32.547
- I can't.
- You can't?

940
01:11:32.627 --> 01:11:35.550
Olivia, no one can, it's a cipher.

941
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:38.750
Even with the keyword
it would take months to decode.

942
01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:42.057
- And without the keyword?
- Perhaps never.

943
01:11:42.137 --> 01:11:43.642
- We'll see.
- We will not see.

944
01:11:43.722 --> 01:11:46.728
If I don't get that back to him tomorrow,
he'll know I took it.

945
01:11:46.808 --> 01:11:49.177
- Leave him.
- I can't. He knows where I live.

946
01:11:50.395 --> 01:11:52.400
This is his diary, Olivia.

947
01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:55.350
All of his secrets
are right here in my hands.

948
01:11:56.151 --> 01:11:57.447
Won't bring your wife back.

949
01:11:57.527 --> 01:12:00.897
I don't care about my wife,
I care about his secret.

950
01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:15.536
Look...

951
01:12:16.337 --> 01:12:18.593
I'll go to his workshop
and stage a break-in.

952
01:12:18.673 --> 01:12:22.931
- He'll know you took it.
- Yes, me. Not you.

953
01:12:23.011 --> 01:12:25.004
Understand?

954
01:12:33.688 --> 01:12:35.139
Robert.

955
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.769
I have fallen in love with him.

956
01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:43.481
Then I know how hard
this has been for you.

957
01:12:51.664 --> 01:12:53.074
Notebook?

958
01:12:55.794 --> 01:12:57.870
Then he's just getting started.

959
01:13:28.117 --> 01:13:29.902
- Good evening.
- Professor.

960
01:13:31.496 --> 01:13:32.822
Professor.

961
01:13:33.081 --> 01:13:34.961
- Could I get your autograph?

962
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:36.588
- I'm walking tonight.
- Professor.

963
01:13:36.668 --> 01:13:38.548
Let him come. I don't care.

964
01:13:38.628 --> 01:13:41.247
- Professor.
- Professor.

965
01:15:05.798 --> 01:15:08.346
- You all right?
- I'm alive.

966
01:15:08.426 --> 01:15:10.711
Saves me cutting you an air hole.

967
01:15:24.609 --> 01:15:27.156
- I'm impressed.
- Why's that?

968
01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:29.939
You're finally getting your hands dirty.

969
01:15:30.281 --> 01:15:33.162
It's what a good trick costs, Angier.

970
01:15:33.242 --> 01:15:34.664
Risk.

971
01:15:34.744 --> 01:15:36.195
Sacrifice.

972
01:15:36.537 --> 01:15:38.750
The sacrifice, I'm afraid,
is gonna be yours,

973
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.418
unless you give me what I want.

974
01:15:41.668 --> 01:15:43.911
- Which is?
- Your secret.

975
01:15:44.253 --> 01:15:46.217
My secret?

976
01:15:46.297 --> 01:15:48.636
Your method for The Transported Man.

977
01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:51.431
Fallon wouldn't tell me.
He doesn't seem to talk at all.

978
01:15:51.511 --> 01:15:52.849
You have my notebook.

979
01:15:52.929 --> 01:15:55.089
Useless without the keyword.

980
01:15:56.391 --> 01:15:58.104
Write down your method, Mr. Borden.

981
01:15:58.184 --> 01:16:00.261
Describe it in full.

982
01:16:13.116 --> 01:16:15.830
I want the whole method,
not the keyword.

983
01:16:15.910 --> 01:16:18.374
I don't even know
if your secret's in your notebook.

984
01:16:18.454 --> 01:16:20.948
The keyword is the method.

985
01:16:24.544 --> 01:16:25.912
Where's my ingénieur?

986
01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:35.630
- Alive?
- How fast can you dig?

987
01:16:38.016 --> 01:16:41.177
Fallon! You hear me? Fallon!

988
01:16:42.395 --> 01:16:45.139
- How's the arm?
- Still attached.

989
01:16:46.482 --> 01:16:48.905
- Did you find your answer?
- Our answer.

990
01:16:48.985 --> 01:16:51.866
Cutter, I haven't looked yet.
I wanted you to share this.

991
01:16:51.946 --> 01:16:54.535
I already know how he does it, Robert.

992
01:16:54.615 --> 01:16:57.538
The same way he always has.
The same way as we do.

993
01:16:57.618 --> 01:17:00.083
It's just that you want something more.

994
01:17:00.163 --> 01:17:01.989
Well, let's find out then,
shall we?

995
01:17:07.295 --> 01:17:08.788
What does it mean?

996
01:17:16.637 --> 01:17:19.018
It means, Cutter,
we have a journey ahead of us.

997
01:17:19.098 --> 01:17:21.896
- To America.
- Robert?

998
01:17:21.976 --> 01:17:24.345
Listen to me.

999
01:17:25.063 --> 01:17:28.528
Obsession is a young man's game.

1000
01:17:28.608 --> 01:17:32.728
- Oh, come on.
- I can't follow you any further in it.

1001
01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.690
I can't. I'm sorry.

1002
01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:41.529
Then the rest is up to me.

1003
01:17:43.414 --> 01:17:45.241
I'm sorry.

1004
01:17:50.254 --> 01:17:53.874
Good evening. Hello, darling.

1005
01:17:54.092 --> 01:17:55.668
Champagne, your finest.

1006
01:17:56.177 --> 01:17:58.683
I didn't know we were
going to be joined for dinner.

1007
01:17:58.763 --> 01:18:01.769
- Absolutely. We are celebrating.
- Miss Wenscombe.

1008
01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:04.897
Mr. Fallon.
Well, what are we celebrating?

1009
01:18:04.977 --> 01:18:07.483
Well, we've hit upon a new trick,
haven't we, Fallon?

1010
01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:10.570
- What trick, Freddy?
- Yes, Freddy, what trick?

1011
01:18:10.650 --> 01:18:14.991
I am going to bury myself alive
every night...

1012
01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:18.953
and then someone will come along
and dig me up. Wonderful.

1013
01:18:19.033 --> 01:18:20.963
No, I think my husband's
had quite enough.

1014
01:18:21.043 --> 01:18:22.999
No, pour the champagne.
Come on, pour--

1015
01:18:23.079 --> 01:18:25.918
Right. Sarah, don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a child.

1016
01:18:25.998 --> 01:18:28.046
- Perhaps it would--
- Perhaps, Mr. Fallon...

1017
01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:31.299
you might escort Miss Wenscombe home.
My husband's being a bore.

1018
01:18:31.379 --> 01:18:35.124
- I see no reason why you have to suffer.
- Oh, please. Don't ruin this evening.

1019
01:18:38.386 --> 01:18:42.131
Good night, Mrs. Borden.
Good night, Freddy.

1020
01:18:45.726 --> 01:18:47.982
- "Freddy"?
- Well, that's my name.

1021
01:18:48.062 --> 01:18:52.516
- Not at home.
- Well, I'm not always at home, am I?

1022
01:18:53.276 --> 01:18:56.407
Well, couldn't you have at least
taken off the beard?

1023
01:18:56.487 --> 01:19:00.119
Sarah, I just came from
the bloody theater just now.

1024
01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:01.996
All right? And I'm out in public.

1025
01:19:02.076 --> 01:19:05.404
- Everybody else loves it.
- Why are you being like this, Alfred?

1026
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:08.324
I had a terrible ordeal today.

1027
01:19:08.499 --> 01:19:13.007
I thought that something very precious...

1028
01:19:13.087 --> 01:19:15.093
had been lost to me.

1029
01:19:15.173 --> 01:19:18.459
So I just wanted to celebrate.
Just a little.

1030
01:19:19.093 --> 01:19:20.807
All right, what?

1031
01:19:20.887 --> 01:19:22.797
What did you lose?

1032
01:19:27.185 --> 01:19:28.761
I see, more secrets.

1033
01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.807
Sarah, secrets are my life.

1034
01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:36.781
- Our life.
- No, Alfred, stop.

1035
01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:40.606
This isn't you. Stop performing.

1036
01:20:04.639 --> 01:20:07.228
I thought I had the place
to myself, Mr. Brent.

1037
01:20:07.308 --> 01:20:08.771
Unexpected guests.

1038
01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:12.400
Not very polite. A lot of questions.

1039
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.194
First I thought they might work
for the government.

1040
01:20:15.274 --> 01:20:17.238
- No?
- Worse.

1041
01:20:17.318 --> 01:20:19.687
They work for Thomas Edison.

1042
01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:23.369
<i>Today, a most curious development.</i>

1043
01:20:23.449 --> 01:20:27.695
<i>His assistant came to us
with a proposition.</i>

1044
01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:31.627
<i>Obviously, Angier has sent her
and told her to admit as much.</i>

1045
01:20:31.707 --> 01:20:34.547
Does he enjoy taking
his bows under the stage?

1046
01:20:34.627 --> 01:20:38.497
He sent me here to steal your secrets,
but I've actually come to offer you his.

1047
01:20:38.798 --> 01:20:42.543
This is the truth, is it?

1048
01:20:50.518 --> 01:20:53.900
No, that's what he told me to tell you.
The truth...

1049
01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:57.862
is that I loved him, and I stood by him,
and he sent me to you...

1050
01:20:57.942 --> 01:21:01.407
like he would send a stagehand
to pick up his shirts.

1051
01:21:01.487 --> 01:21:04.356
I hate him for that.

1052
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:08.527
I can spot Angier's methods
from the back of the theater.

1053
01:21:09.495 --> 01:21:11.739
So, what could you possibly
have to offer me?

1054
01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:14.879
You know how he does his tricks,
but you can't understand...

1055
01:21:14.959 --> 01:21:17.506
why no one can see yours are better.
You hide this.

1056
01:21:17.586 --> 01:21:21.636
I had to look very closely to spot it when
you were performing The Transported Man...

1057
01:21:21.716 --> 01:21:24.430
but this makes you unique.

1058
01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:26.766
It shows the audience
you aren't using a double.

1059
01:21:26.846 --> 01:21:29.018
You mustn't hide it,
display it proudly.

1060
01:21:29.098 --> 01:21:33.594
I'm sure it takes great skill
to perform illusions with one good hand.

1061
01:21:33.853 --> 01:21:36.096
Yeah, it does.

1062
01:21:37.398 --> 01:21:40.184
So let people know.

1063
01:21:40.651 --> 01:21:44.605
You could be so much more than he is,
and I can show you how.

1064
01:21:45.906 --> 01:21:47.900
<i>I think she's telling the truth.</i>

1065
01:21:48.576 --> 01:21:50.903
<i>I think we cannot trust her.</i>

1066
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:56.909
<i>But I love her. I need her.</i>

1067
01:21:58.002 --> 01:22:01.175
<i>To open myself to such a relationship...</i>

1068
01:22:01.255 --> 01:22:05.292
<i>to the dangers of such an affair...</i>

1069
01:22:05.593 --> 01:22:10.172
<i>I need assurances of fidelity. Of love.</i>

1070
01:22:11.098 --> 01:22:12.800
<i>But how to be sure?</i>

1071
01:22:14.977 --> 01:22:19.318
<i>I know a way.
It's the only way to know her mind.</i>

1072
01:22:19.398 --> 01:22:21.267
How could he send you away?

1073
01:22:22.943 --> 01:22:24.979
<i>She must help me rid ourselves
of Angier.</i>

1074
01:22:32.745 --> 01:22:35.626
<i>Today, my mistress proves
her truthfulness.</i>

1075
01:22:35.706 --> 01:22:38.087
<i>Not to me, you understand.</i>

1076
01:22:38.167 --> 01:22:40.256
<i>I've been convinced
since she led me to Root.</i>

1077
01:22:40.336 --> 01:22:46.220
<i>Today, Olivia proves her love for me
to you, Angier.</i>

1078
01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.264
<i>Yes, Angier.</i>

1079
01:22:48.344 --> 01:22:50.725
<i>She gave you this notebook
at my request.</i>

1080
01:22:50.805 --> 01:22:56.063
<i>And, yes, "Tesla" is merely the key
to my diary, not to my trick.</i>

1081
01:22:56.143 --> 01:23:00.776
<i>Did you really think I'd part
with my secret so easily after so much?</i>

1082
01:23:00.856 --> 01:23:02.194
<i>Goodbye, Angier.</i>

1083
01:23:02.274 --> 01:23:06.562
<i>May you find solace for your thwarted
ambition back in your American home.</i>

1084
01:23:16.872 --> 01:23:18.365
Tesla!

1085
01:23:19.458 --> 01:23:24.133
Tesla! Alley! Alley!

1086
01:23:24.213 --> 01:23:26.719
Tesla never made a machine
like the one I asked for.

1087
01:23:26.799 --> 01:23:29.597
- We never said he had.
- But you let me believe that he had.

1088
01:23:29.677 --> 01:23:32.433
You stole my money because
your funding had been cut off.

1089
01:23:32.513 --> 01:23:36.354
You've been shooting sparks at my top hat,
laughing at me all along...

1090
01:23:36.434 --> 01:23:39.094
while using my money
to stave off ruin.

1091
01:23:39.937 --> 01:23:41.942
- Now, I have seen Edison's men.
- Where?

1092
01:23:42.022 --> 01:23:45.112
In the hotel. And I have every mind
to bring them up here myself.

1093
01:23:45.192 --> 01:23:47.281
That would be unwise, Mr. Angier.

1094
01:23:47.361 --> 01:23:50.493
It is true that you are
our last remaining financier...

1095
01:23:50.573 --> 01:23:52.453
but we have not stolen your money.

1096
01:23:52.533 --> 01:23:53.954
Sir, my cat.

1097
01:23:54.034 --> 01:23:57.124
When I told you I could make
your machine, I spoke a simple truth.

1098
01:23:57.204 --> 01:24:00.711
- Then why isn't the machine working?
- Because exact science, Mr. Angier...

1099
01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:02.242
is not an exact science.

1100
01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.424
The machine simply does not operate
as expected.

1101
01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:07.843
It requires further examination.

1102
01:24:07.923 --> 01:24:10.638
- So where did my top hat go?
- Nowhere.

1103
01:24:10.718 --> 01:24:13.557
We tried the damn thing a dozen times.

1104
01:24:13.637 --> 01:24:15.059
The hat went nowhere.

1105
01:24:15.139 --> 01:24:17.144
We need to try different material.

1106
01:24:17.224 --> 01:24:21.095
It may provoke a different result.

1107
01:24:21.854 --> 01:24:23.722
Copernicus, come on.

1108
01:24:30.696 --> 01:24:35.401
You are responsible for whatever happens
to this animal, doctor.

1109
01:24:56.263 --> 01:25:00.020
I hope that whatever you were really doing
with my money was more worthwhile...

1110
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:02.261
Mr. Tesla.

1111
01:25:57.157 --> 01:25:58.358
Alley!

1112
01:26:01.579 --> 01:26:02.917
So the machine was working.

1113
01:26:02.997 --> 01:26:06.587
I never bothered to check the calibration
because the hat never moved.

1114
01:26:06.667 --> 01:26:09.840
These things never quite work
as you expect them to, Mr. Angier.

1115
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:12.176
That's one of the principal
beauties of science.

1116
01:26:12.256 --> 01:26:15.721
I'll need a couple of weeks to iron out
the problems with the machine.

1117
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:18.212
We'll send word when it's ready.

1118
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:22.508
Don't forget your hat.

1119
01:26:23.142 --> 01:26:27.095
- Well, which one is mine?
- They're all your hats, Mr. Angier.

1120
01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:35.908
You look so pretty
in this new dress of yours.

1121
01:26:35.988 --> 01:26:37.778
Are we going
to the zoo this afternoon?

1122
01:26:37.858 --> 01:26:39.954
No, no, no.
Daddy has some errands to run.

1123
01:26:40.034 --> 01:26:42.122
- But you promised.
- I promised, did I?

1124
01:26:42.202 --> 01:26:44.458
Then go to the zoo we shall.

1125
01:26:44.538 --> 01:26:47.920
So Daddy will go run his errands
and I'll be back before you know it...

1126
01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.912
so you go get ready.
We'll go see those chimpanzees.

1127
01:26:54.965 --> 01:26:57.125
Sarah.

1128
01:26:57.301 --> 01:26:58.544
What are you doing?

1129
01:27:01.889 --> 01:27:05.217
We each of us have our vices.

1130
01:27:08.062 --> 01:27:11.682
Sarah, whatever you may think...

1131
01:27:11.982 --> 01:27:15.656
your only competition for my affections
is our little girl.

1132
01:27:15.736 --> 01:27:20.274
I love you. I will always love you
and you alone.

1133
01:27:22.117 --> 01:27:25.529
- You mean it today.
- Absolutely.

1134
01:27:26.163 --> 01:27:29.658
Which makes it so much harder
when you don't.

1135
01:27:39.134 --> 01:27:41.974
Is that more shopping?
She does love the smell of money.

1136
01:27:42.054 --> 01:27:45.477
The little lady wants to go to the zoo,
so I thought you could take her.

1137
01:27:45.557 --> 01:27:48.731
Yeah? I mean,
I can do it tomorrow if not.

1138
01:27:48.811 --> 01:27:54.474
And Sarah, she knows.

1139
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:58.407
She-- I mean, at least she knows
that something's not right...

1140
01:27:58.487 --> 01:28:02.036
so if you can just do whatever you can
to help me with her.

1141
01:28:02.116 --> 01:28:06.278
Talk to her. Just convince her
that I do love her.

1142
01:28:17.047 --> 01:28:21.180
- What is it, Freddy?
- Just don't call me that, please.

1143
01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.891
It's nothing. It's just, you know,
there's sometimes...

1144
01:28:23.971 --> 01:28:26.393
- Sometimes it seems wrong.
- I've told you before...

1145
01:28:26.473 --> 01:28:28.103
when you're with me,
you're with me.

1146
01:28:28.183 --> 01:28:30.427
Leave your family at home
where they belong.

1147
01:28:30.853 --> 01:28:32.399
I'm trying.

1148
01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.068
I'm trying, Olivia.

1149
01:28:34.148 --> 01:28:36.850
- I'll get dressed.
- Yeah.

1150
01:28:37.985 --> 01:28:41.021
I saw Fallon hanging around again.

1151
01:28:41.363 --> 01:28:43.690
There's something
about that man I don't trust.

1152
01:28:43.824 --> 01:28:46.860
You trust me? Then trust Patton.

1153
01:28:47.161 --> 01:28:49.571
He protects the things that I care about.

1154
01:29:27.701 --> 01:29:30.124
We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.

1155
01:29:30.204 --> 01:29:32.835
We were sorry to see
Mr. Tesla leave as well.

1156
01:29:32.915 --> 01:29:35.117
He was very good to Colorado Springs.

1157
01:29:35.417 --> 01:29:41.581
Mr. Angier, I didn't think it was necessary
to tell Edison's men about the box.

1158
01:29:42.049 --> 01:29:43.250
What box?

1159
01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:12.070
<i>I apologize for leaving
without saying goodbye...</i>

1160
01:30:12.329 --> 01:30:16.700
<i>but I seem to have outstayed
my welcome in Colorado.</i>

1161
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:21.800
<i>The truly extraordinary is not
permitted in science and industry.</i>

1162
01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:24.769
<i>Perhaps you'll find
more luck in your field,</i>

1163
01:30:24.849 --> 01:30:27.389
<i>where people are happy
to be mystified.</i>

1164
01:30:27.469 --> 01:30:31.590
<i>You will find what
you are looking for in this box.</i>

1165
01:30:31.807 --> 01:30:35.939
<i>Alley has written you
a thorough set of instructions.</i>

1166
01:30:36.019 --> 01:30:40.736
<i>I add only one suggestion
on using the machine:</i>

1167
01:30:40.816 --> 01:30:42.863
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1168
01:30:42.943 --> 01:30:46.116
<i>Drop it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.</i>

1169
01:30:46.196 --> 01:30:49.608
<i>Such a thing will bring you only misery.</i>

1170
01:30:53.453 --> 01:30:57.085
<i>Tesla's warning is as unheeded
as he knew it would be.</i>

1171
01:30:57.165 --> 01:30:59.213
<i>Today, I tested the machine...</i>

1172
01:30:59.293 --> 01:31:03.842
<i>taking precautions in case Tesla hadn't
ironed out the kinks in its operation.</i>

1173
01:31:03.922 --> 01:31:08.960
<i>I mean, if it went wrong,
I would not wanna live like that for long.</i>

1174
01:31:27.404 --> 01:31:31.537
<i>But here at the Turn,
I must leave you, Borden.</i>

1175
01:31:31.617 --> 01:31:33.872
<i>Yes, you, Borden.</i>

1176
01:31:33.952 --> 01:31:36.250
<i>Sitting there in your cell...</i>

1177
01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:40.462
<i>reading my diary, awaiting your death...</i>

1178
01:31:40.542 --> 01:31:42.828
<i>for my murder.</i>

1179
01:31:47.799 --> 01:31:51.098
Angier's journal, that gesture
of good faith, that's a fake.

1180
01:31:51.178 --> 01:31:55.269
I assure you, it's not. The provenance
of the journal is clear and under no doubt.

1181
01:31:55.349 --> 01:32:00.095
And it's written in Angier's own hand,
of which we had numerous examples.

1182
01:32:01.855 --> 01:32:03.849
It don't matter.

1183
01:32:05.692 --> 01:32:08.812
So my tricks.

1184
01:32:10.989 --> 01:32:14.860
- All of them.
- Including The Transported Man?

1185
01:32:15.494 --> 01:32:17.875
Well, Lord Caldlow
will be very pleased indeed.

1186
01:32:17.955 --> 01:32:21.545
No, he won't.
Because they're not complete.

1187
01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:24.298
It's just the Pledge
and the Turn for each.

1188
01:32:24.378 --> 01:32:27.205
Without the Prestige for these tricks...

1189
01:32:27.589 --> 01:32:30.125
- these are worthless.
- Yeah.

1190
01:32:30.592 --> 01:32:34.254
You get the rest of it
when you bring my daughter here.

1191
01:32:36.932 --> 01:32:39.217
I wanna say goodbye.

1192
01:32:40.894 --> 01:32:42.316
We have to go through it now.

1193
01:32:42.396 --> 01:32:45.027
Listen, we have to go through it now.
Now, listen to me.

1194
01:32:45.107 --> 01:32:46.486
Deny it all you want.

1195
01:32:46.566 --> 01:32:48.947
Olivia means nothing.

1196
01:32:49.027 --> 01:32:50.490
- Olivia?
- I need an assistant.

1197
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:51.783
No, I'll go to her.

1198
01:32:51.863 --> 01:32:53.702
- I'll tell her I know--
- Tell her what?

1199
01:32:53.782 --> 01:32:57.652
I know what you really are, Alfred. I...

1200
01:32:57.911 --> 01:32:59.958
- I know, and I--
- Sarah, Sarah.

1201
01:33:00.038 --> 01:33:02.377
- I can't keep it in.
- You can't talk like this.

1202
01:33:02.457 --> 01:33:03.545
Sarah, shut up.

1203
01:33:03.625 --> 01:33:05.118
- No, no.
- Sarah, shut up!

1204
01:33:05.252 --> 01:33:07.007
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

1205
01:33:07.087 --> 01:33:10.290
You can't talk like this!

1206
01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.973
You can't hide it anymore
because I know, Alfred, I know.

1207
01:33:15.053 --> 01:33:16.850
I know what you really are!

1208
01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:18.685
Alfred...

1209
01:33:18.765 --> 01:33:21.563
I can't live like this.

1210
01:33:21.643 --> 01:33:23.690
Oh, well, you think I can live like this?

1211
01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:27.027
You think I bloody enjoy living like this?

1212
01:33:27.107 --> 01:33:29.780
- Stop it and listen! No!
- We have this beautiful house...

1213
01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:33.200
lovely little girl, we're married.
What is so wrong with your life?

1214
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.994
Alfred, I can't live like this!

1215
01:33:36.074 --> 01:33:39.027
Well, what do you want from me?

1216
01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:45.212
I want...

1217
01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:48.620
I want you to be honest with me.

1218
01:33:51.298 --> 01:33:53.333
No tricks...

1219
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.349
no lies...

1220
01:33:57.429 --> 01:34:00.799
and no secrets.

1221
01:34:06.188 --> 01:34:09.724
Do you--? Do you love me?

1222
01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.312
Not today.

1223
01:34:16.156 --> 01:34:17.357
No.

1224
01:35:55.088 --> 01:35:57.290
Who's there?

1225
01:35:59.217 --> 01:36:01.098
I'm looking for an old friend.

1226
01:36:01.178 --> 01:36:02.504
I heard about a booking.

1227
01:36:03.096 --> 01:36:05.894
Nice little theater.
Good up-and-coming magician.

1228
01:36:05.974 --> 01:36:08.468
- You're back.
- It's good to see you, John.

1229
01:36:09.227 --> 01:36:11.900
Good rehearsal space.

1230
01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:14.694
Blind stagehands, I like it.

1231
01:36:14.774 --> 01:36:17.322
You always had
a good eye for publicity.

1232
01:36:17.402 --> 01:36:18.978
I need your help, John.

1233
01:36:19.279 --> 01:36:21.815
It's my last show. A limited engagement.

1234
01:36:22.073 --> 01:36:23.525
Your last show?

1235
01:36:23.867 --> 01:36:27.415
A wise man once told me
obsession was a young man's game.

1236
01:36:27.495 --> 01:36:28.696
I'm almost done.

1237
01:36:29.456 --> 01:36:31.449
There's one thing left.

1238
01:36:32.292 --> 01:36:34.869
The Real Transported Man.

1239
01:36:36.588 --> 01:36:38.593
You wanna design a show around it.

1240
01:36:38.673 --> 01:36:41.555
I don't want you backstage.
I need you front of house, managing.

1241
01:36:41.635 --> 01:36:44.266
I need you to call in favors
or connections you have...

1242
01:36:44.346 --> 01:36:48.019
- to get us the right booking for the run.
- What sort of booking you after?

1243
01:36:48.099 --> 01:36:50.510
The sort that Borden can't ignore.

1244
01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.532
What an honor it is to see you again, sir.

1245
01:37:00.612 --> 01:37:04.035
You told me you only wanted to show me
one trick. It piqued my interest.

1246
01:37:04.115 --> 01:37:07.247
- It's a very clever trick, Mr. Ackerman.
- Pleased to meet you.

1247
01:37:07.327 --> 01:37:10.363
Likewise, I'm sure.
Well, let's get on, shall we?

1248
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.202
Turn it on, gentlemen.

1249
01:37:20.882 --> 01:37:22.167
Very pretty.

1250
01:37:33.144 --> 01:37:36.651
That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears?

1251
01:37:36.731 --> 01:37:39.654
That's not a trick.
Well, he has to come back.

1252
01:37:39.734 --> 01:37:40.906
There has to be a--

1253
01:37:40.986 --> 01:37:42.604
- A Prestige?
- Exactly.

1254
01:37:45.573 --> 01:37:47.567
Pardon me.

1255
01:37:48.159 --> 01:37:50.778
It's very rare to see...

1256
01:37:51.538 --> 01:37:53.656
real magic.

1257
01:37:54.249 --> 01:37:56.256
Yes, it's been
many years since I've seen--

1258
01:37:56.336 --> 01:37:58.128
Are you interested in helping us?

1259
01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:01.789
Yes.

1260
01:38:02.215 --> 01:38:04.751
But you'll have to dress it up a little.

1261
01:38:06.177 --> 01:38:08.046
Disguise it.

1262
01:38:09.389 --> 01:38:12.091
Give them enough reason to doubt it.

1263
01:38:12.726 --> 01:38:16.024
You haven't spoken about her, Freddy.
Not once.

1264
01:38:16.104 --> 01:38:19.819
Why would I talk about her to you?

1265
01:38:19.899 --> 01:38:22.364
Because she was a part of your life.

1266
01:38:22.444 --> 01:38:23.811
And now she's gone.

1267
01:38:26.531 --> 01:38:29.089
You know,
the day before she killed herself,

1268
01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:31.039
she said she wanted to meet me.

1269
01:38:31.119 --> 01:38:34.167
That she had something
to tell me about you.

1270
01:38:34.247 --> 01:38:37.671
I was such a coward,
I couldn't bring myself to face her.

1271
01:38:37.751 --> 01:38:39.619
But...

1272
01:38:40.628 --> 01:38:42.884
what would she have said?

1273
01:38:42.964 --> 01:38:46.084
You wanna know the truth about me?

1274
01:38:47.010 --> 01:38:50.713
Truth is that...

1275
01:38:51.931 --> 01:38:54.133
I never loved Sarah.

1276
01:38:55.602 --> 01:38:56.690
I never loved her.

1277
01:38:56.770 --> 01:38:58.883
You married her.
You had a child with her.

1278
01:38:58.963 --> 01:39:00.193
Yes, yes. Part of me.

1279
01:39:00.273 --> 01:39:04.072
Part of me did, but the other part didn't.

1280
01:39:04.152 --> 01:39:07.689
The part that found you.
The part that's sitting here right now.

1281
01:39:08.615 --> 01:39:09.816
I love you.

1282
01:39:10.116 --> 01:39:13.581
No, Olivia, I love you. That's the truth.

1283
01:39:13.661 --> 01:39:16.167
That is the truth that matters.

1284
01:39:16.247 --> 01:39:20.547
You could be in some other restaurant
with some other woman right now...

1285
01:39:20.627 --> 01:39:22.340
talking about me that way.

1286
01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:24.622
- No.
- Yes.

1287
01:39:27.801 --> 01:39:32.755
It's inhuman to be so cold.

1288
01:39:37.727 --> 01:39:41.609
He's back. After two years.

1289
01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:45.560
He's got a new trick. They're saying
it's the best London's ever seen.

1290
01:39:47.695 --> 01:39:51.316
You should see the look
on your face, Professor.

1291
01:39:52.075 --> 01:39:54.039
You should go to him.

1292
01:39:54.119 --> 01:39:56.696
You two deserve each other.

1293
01:40:01.584 --> 01:40:05.467
I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet,
they'll be playing through next year.

1294
01:40:05.547 --> 01:40:08.261
Then get rid of them.
There'll be a hundred performances.

1295
01:40:08.341 --> 01:40:10.096
No more, no less.

1296
01:40:10.176 --> 01:40:12.837
Five performances a week. No matinees.

1297
01:40:14.514 --> 01:40:17.675
And that's what you'll be charging
for each ticket. Good day.

1298
01:40:40.248 --> 01:40:42.837
Ladies and gentlemen,
my first trick of the evening...

1299
01:40:42.917 --> 01:40:45.787
is one that involves considerable risk.

1300
01:40:46.045 --> 01:40:48.885
Anyone in the audience
who would be irrevocably damaged...

1301
01:40:48.965 --> 01:40:52.097
by seeing a man drown
should leave now.

1302
01:40:52.177 --> 01:40:55.225
For when I tell you the young lady
who taught me this illusion...

1303
01:40:55.305 --> 01:40:56.976
actually died performing it...

1304
01:40:57.056 --> 01:41:00.468
you will understand the seriousness
of the dangers involved.

1305
01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.430
Let's begin.

1306
01:41:14.616 --> 01:41:18.194
In my travels, I have seen the future...

1307
01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:22.156
and it is a strange future indeed.

1308
01:41:22.665 --> 01:41:24.838
The world, ladies and gentlemen...

1309
01:41:24.918 --> 01:41:30.415
is on the brink of new
and terrifying possibilities.

1310
01:41:49.484 --> 01:41:54.033
What you're about to witness
is not magic.

1311
01:41:54.113 --> 01:41:55.773
It is purely science.

1312
01:41:55.949 --> 01:41:58.455
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1313
01:41:58.535 --> 01:42:01.654
so that you can examine the machine
for yourselves.

1314
01:42:56.926 --> 01:43:00.183
Man's reach exceeds his imagination.

1315
01:43:00.263 --> 01:43:01.672
Bravo!

1316
01:43:04.434 --> 01:43:07.220
Bravo! Bravo!

1317
01:43:11.482 --> 01:43:14.227
Bravo. Bravo.

1318
01:43:22.285 --> 01:43:24.040
One hundred performances.

1319
01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:26.501
Why? Does his method dictate that?

1320
01:43:26.581 --> 01:43:28.586
Is it a publicity move? What is it?

1321
01:43:28.666 --> 01:43:31.130
He's a no-talent magician,
and they're calling him...

1322
01:43:31.210 --> 01:43:33.466
the bloody best in England. Why?

1323
01:43:33.546 --> 01:43:36.302
Fifty yards in a second. In a second!

1324
01:43:36.382 --> 01:43:39.430
And all that we know
is he uses a trap door.

1325
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:43.297
Brilliant. What is going on
under that stage?

1326
01:43:43.890 --> 01:43:46.884
Why can't you outthink him?

1327
01:44:01.407 --> 01:44:02.996
<i>They do this every night?</i>

1328
01:44:03.076 --> 01:44:06.445
After each performance, yeah?

1329
01:44:36.651 --> 01:44:38.477
We're done.

1330
01:44:39.445 --> 01:44:41.063
All right?

1331
01:44:42.281 --> 01:44:44.037
Let him have his trick.

1332
01:44:44.117 --> 01:44:46.623
I don't need-- I don't need his secret.

1333
01:44:46.703 --> 01:44:48.487
So...

1334
01:44:49.622 --> 01:44:52.629
don't go back there,
you leave him alone.

1335
01:44:52.709 --> 01:44:55.965
Both of us, just leave him alone.

1336
01:44:56.045 --> 01:44:57.705
We're done.

1337
01:45:06.472 --> 01:45:08.519
I told you, John...

1338
01:45:08.599 --> 01:45:10.718
I don't want you backstage
on this one.

1339
01:45:12.395 --> 01:45:14.901
I would like to invite you
to come up on-stage now...

1340
01:45:14.981 --> 01:45:18.225
so that you can examine the machine
for yourselves.

1341
01:45:46.512 --> 01:45:48.569
Hey, you, where
do you think you're going?

1342
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:50.725
I'm part of the bloody act, you fool.

1343
01:45:59.567 --> 01:46:01.560
Who was that?

1344
01:46:57.917 --> 01:46:59.005
Hey!

1345
01:46:59.085 --> 01:47:02.717
Where's the bloody key?
Where's the bloody key?

1346
01:47:02.797 --> 01:47:05.136
The blind man's got it!

1347
01:47:05.216 --> 01:47:08.961
Where's the bloody key?
Bloody drowning!

1348
01:47:18.145 --> 01:47:20.306
Hold on!

1349
01:47:24.527 --> 01:47:25.978
What have you done?

1350
01:47:47.717 --> 01:47:53.142
Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty
of the murder of Robert Angier.

1351
01:47:53.222 --> 01:47:57.051
You will be hanged by the neck
until dead.

1352
01:47:57.643 --> 01:48:00.846
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.

1353
01:48:02.273 --> 01:48:04.266
Mr. Cutter?

1354
01:48:04.817 --> 01:48:06.310
Owens.

1355
01:48:06.819 --> 01:48:09.075
Oh, thank you for coming, Mr. Owens.

1356
01:48:09.155 --> 01:48:13.538
It has fallen to me to dispose
of Mr. Angier's equipment.

1357
01:48:13.618 --> 01:48:15.289
But I noticed from this manifest...

1358
01:48:15.369 --> 01:48:18.918
that Lord Caldlow
has purchased the bulk of the items.

1359
01:48:18.998 --> 01:48:23.047
Mr. Cutter, if you needed to know
where to deliver these items, surely you--

1360
01:48:23.127 --> 01:48:26.509
No, no. It's just
there is one particular item...

1361
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:30.721
this item,
in fact, that I would like to--

1362
01:48:30.801 --> 01:48:32.890
- You would like to...?
- Buy.

1363
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:35.089
- Buy yourself?
- Yeah, I suppose so.

1364
01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:38.145
- This is the machine?
- Yes.

1365
01:48:38.225 --> 01:48:42.888
Well, I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant
about purchasing this particular item.

1366
01:48:43.147 --> 01:48:46.058
Do you think I could talk
to Lord Caldlow in person?

1367
01:48:46.275 --> 01:48:48.894
Out of the question, I'm afraid.

1368
01:48:51.197 --> 01:48:53.077
Of course...

1369
01:48:53.157 --> 01:48:56.122
I suppose if, in the course
of your delivery arrangements...

1370
01:48:56.202 --> 01:48:58.863
your paths were to cross...

1371
01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:03.200
- I can't stop you speaking your mind.
- Thank you.

1372
01:49:04.502 --> 01:49:06.912
- Still here, Borden?
- For now.

1373
01:49:07.421 --> 01:49:08.801
Got a visitor.

1374
01:49:08.881 --> 01:49:10.344
Lord Caldlow.

1375
01:49:10.424 --> 01:49:12.710
With a little girl.

1376
01:49:21.018 --> 01:49:22.690
Jess?

1377
01:49:22.770 --> 01:49:24.471
Hello, my love.

1378
01:49:24.981 --> 01:49:27.945
How are you? I've missed you so much.

1379
01:49:28.025 --> 01:49:30.156
And Fallon's missed you too.
We both have.

1380
01:49:30.236 --> 01:49:32.646
Daddy, can I come in there?

1381
01:49:33.239 --> 01:49:35.661
Not right now. Not right now, darling.

1382
01:49:35.741 --> 01:49:39.486
No, but everything is gonna be all right.

1383
01:49:39.745 --> 01:49:42.615
- You must be Lord Caldlow.
- Caldlow.

1384
01:49:42.748 --> 01:49:43.961
Yes, I am.

1385
01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:45.409
I always have been.

1386
01:49:50.256 --> 01:49:52.511
They flatter you
with all those chains, Alfred.

1387
01:49:52.591 --> 01:49:55.640
Don't they know you can't escape
without your little rubber ball?

1388
01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.933
I pulled you out.

1389
01:49:57.013 --> 01:49:58.643
Out of that tank.

1390
01:49:58.723 --> 01:50:02.480
All I wanted to do was prove
that I was a better magician...

1391
01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.637
but you couldn't leave me alone.

1392
01:50:06.105 --> 01:50:08.474
I don't know what you've done...

1393
01:50:10.151 --> 01:50:13.741
but you're not afraid
to get your hands dirty anymore, are you?

1394
01:50:13.821 --> 01:50:15.743
No, not anymore.

1395
01:50:15.823 --> 01:50:17.161
And I win.

1396
01:50:17.241 --> 01:50:20.539
Because no one cares about the man
in the box, the man who disappears.

1397
01:50:20.619 --> 01:50:21.820
You win?

1398
01:50:23.122 --> 01:50:27.630
This ain't a bloody competition anymore,
Angier, this is my little girl's life.

1399
01:50:27.710 --> 01:50:30.883
And don't you dare put her
in the middle of this.

1400
01:50:30.963 --> 01:50:33.886
Oh, I know how hard it is
to have someone so special...

1401
01:50:33.966 --> 01:50:36.794
taken away from me, don't I, Borden?

1402
01:50:37.428 --> 01:50:40.142
And you can't take her with you now,
can you?

1403
01:50:40.222 --> 01:50:42.174
Oh, she'll be looked after.

1404
01:50:42.516 --> 01:50:46.732
- Goodbye, Professor. Come on, darling.
- No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop. Look.

1405
01:50:46.812 --> 01:50:48.347
Here.

1406
01:50:49.607 --> 01:50:51.404
That's what you're after.

1407
01:50:51.484 --> 01:50:53.698
That's what this is about.

1408
01:50:53.778 --> 01:50:55.116
Take it.

1409
01:50:55.196 --> 01:50:57.356
- Your secret?
- Yeah.

1410
01:51:00.159 --> 01:51:02.623
You always were the better magician.

1411
01:51:02.703 --> 01:51:04.291
We both know that.

1412
01:51:04.371 --> 01:51:08.254
But whatever your secret was,
I mean, you have to agree...

1413
01:51:08.334 --> 01:51:09.535
mine is better.

1414
01:51:11.253 --> 01:51:14.665
Don't do this. Don't do this, Angier, no.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

1415
01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:18.210
Jess, I'm gonna take you home soon.
I promise.

1416
01:51:18.385 --> 01:51:20.879
- For God's sake, Borden.
- I promise. Look.

1417
01:51:24.642 --> 01:51:26.105
I promise.

1418
01:51:26.185 --> 01:51:29.942
- I love you, Jess. I love you.
- Come on.

1419
01:51:30.022 --> 01:51:33.279
- Come on. Come on.
- I love you. I love you, Jess.

1420
01:51:33.359 --> 01:51:35.781
Angier. Angier!

1421
01:51:35.861 --> 01:51:37.950
What, you think this place can hold me?

1422
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:40.995
Angier! They're gonna bloody hang me!

1423
01:51:41.075 --> 01:51:44.290
They're gonna bloody hang me!
You can put a stop to this now!

1424
01:51:44.370 --> 01:51:46.542
- Listen! Listen! That man--!
- Just shut up.

1425
01:51:46.622 --> 01:51:49.128
Listen, that man is the one
I'm meant to have killed!

1426
01:51:49.208 --> 01:51:51.255
You blind bastard, listen to me!

1427
01:51:51.335 --> 01:51:53.340
- If he's alive, I'm not guilty!
- Guards!

1428
01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:55.676
- I'm not guilty!
- I don't care! Get hold of him!

1429
01:51:55.756 --> 01:51:57.958
- Good bye, Professor.
- Angier!

1430
01:52:02.513 --> 01:52:04.423
Run along now.

1431
01:52:05.182 --> 01:52:08.886
Sir. There's a gentleman waiting.

1432
01:52:24.535 --> 01:52:25.778
Dear God.

1433
01:52:26.370 --> 01:52:28.238
Hello, Cutter.

1434
01:52:28.622 --> 01:52:30.628
You're-- You're still alive.

1435
01:52:30.708 --> 01:52:32.630
How is it you're still alive, Robert?

1436
01:52:32.710 --> 01:52:35.204
I saw you on a slab, for God's sake.

1437
01:52:38.257 --> 01:52:40.137
- Child.
- Good night, sir.

1438
01:52:40.217 --> 01:52:41.919
Good night, Jess.

1439
01:52:43.512 --> 01:52:45.101
I've seen her before.

1440
01:52:45.181 --> 01:52:50.677
I saw her in court with Fallon.

1441
01:52:52.354 --> 01:52:54.944
- What have you done?
- Well, she needs looking after.

1442
01:52:55.024 --> 01:52:57.476
She needs her father.

1443
01:52:57.693 --> 01:53:00.533
You're letting him hang,
and I helped you.

1444
01:53:00.613 --> 01:53:06.693
I came here to beg Lord Caldlow
to let me destroy that machine.

1445
01:53:07.036 --> 01:53:10.376
I am not gonna beg you for anything.

1446
01:53:10.456 --> 01:53:13.909
You don't have to. I'm gonna make sure
that machine's never used again.

1447
01:53:14.877 --> 01:53:19.331
Then, Lord Caldlow...

1448
01:53:20.633 --> 01:53:22.638
where do you want me to deliver it?

1449
01:53:22.718 --> 01:53:24.181
My theater.

1450
01:53:24.261 --> 01:53:26.588
It belongs with the Prestige materials.

1451
01:53:27.014 --> 01:53:29.716
John, I tried not to involve you.

1452
01:53:42.488 --> 01:53:44.565
So...

1453
01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.986
we go alone now.

1454
01:53:49.453 --> 01:53:51.530
Both of us.

1455
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:58.370
Only I don't have as far to go as you.

1456
01:54:03.425 --> 01:54:05.294
No.

1457
01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:09.798
You were right, I should have left him
to his damn trick.

1458
01:54:11.141 --> 01:54:13.093
I'm sorry.

1459
01:54:14.687 --> 01:54:17.264
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1460
01:54:18.190 --> 01:54:20.559
I'm sorry about Sarah.

1461
01:54:22.027 --> 01:54:23.824
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1462
01:54:23.904 --> 01:54:26.064
I didn't.

1463
01:54:27.408 --> 01:54:30.206
You go live your life
in full now, all right?

1464
01:54:30.286 --> 01:54:32.029
You live for both of us.

1465
01:54:40.546 --> 01:54:42.289
Goodbye.

1466
01:55:28.385 --> 01:55:30.379
Are you watching closely?

1467
01:56:01.627 --> 01:56:03.829
Put it down the end.

1468
01:56:37.204 --> 01:56:41.575
Take a minute to consider
your achievement.

1469
01:56:41.792 --> 01:56:47.009
I once told you about a sailor
who described drowning to me.

1470
01:56:47.089 --> 01:56:49.374
Yes, he said it was like going home.

1471
01:56:50.217 --> 01:56:55.339
I was lying. He said it was agony.

1472
01:57:33.886 --> 01:57:36.046
Alfred Borden...

1473
01:57:36.221 --> 01:57:40.062
this day, in the name of the king
and the High Court of England...

1474
01:57:40.142 --> 01:57:42.594
you will meet your end.

1475
01:57:44.062 --> 01:57:47.182
No one cares about the man in the box.

1476
01:57:51.069 --> 01:57:52.896
Cutter?

1477
01:57:57.409 --> 01:57:59.194
Cutter?

1478
01:58:00.787 --> 01:58:04.408
Do you have anything to say?

1479
01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:09.413
Abracadabra.

1480
01:58:45.832 --> 01:58:47.671
A brother.

1481
01:58:47.751 --> 01:58:49.286
A twin.

1482
01:58:50.254 --> 01:58:55.637
You were Fallon the whole time.

1483
01:58:55.717 --> 01:58:57.043
No.

1484
01:58:57.844 --> 01:59:00.309
We were both Fallon.

1485
01:59:00.389 --> 01:59:01.673
<i>And we were both Borden.</i>

1486
01:59:07.646 --> 01:59:10.652
Were you--? Were you the one
who went into the box...

1487
01:59:10.732 --> 01:59:12.726
or the one who came back out?

1488
01:59:13.819 --> 01:59:16.104
We took turns.

1489
01:59:20.784 --> 01:59:22.986
The trick is where we would swap.

1490
01:59:29.084 --> 01:59:33.747
Cutter knew. Cutter knew.
But I told him it was too simple, too easy.

1491
01:59:34.715 --> 01:59:36.541
No.

1492
01:59:37.092 --> 01:59:39.169
Simple maybe, but not easy.

1493
01:59:39.344 --> 01:59:43.089
<i>There's nothing easy
about two men sharing one life.</i>

1494
01:59:48.562 --> 01:59:50.931
I don't understand
how it can be bleeding again.

1495
01:59:55.736 --> 01:59:58.104
What about Olivia? And your wife?

1496
01:59:58.864 --> 02:00:01.024
We each loved one of them.

1497
02:00:04.536 --> 02:00:06.738
<i>I loved Sarah.</i>

1498
02:00:07.581 --> 02:00:10.033
<i>He loved Olivia.</i>

1499
02:00:10.292 --> 02:00:15.509
We each had half of a full life, really,
which was enough for us.

1500
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:17.582
Just.

1501
02:00:19.134 --> 02:00:21.169
But not for them.

1502
02:00:23.597 --> 02:00:28.510
See, sacrifice, Robert,
that's the price of a good trick.

1503
02:00:30.812 --> 02:00:33.765
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

1504
02:00:37.069 --> 02:00:38.448
I've made sacrifices.

1505
02:00:38.528 --> 02:00:40.480
- No.
- Yes.

1506
02:00:40.906 --> 02:00:44.067
It takes nothing
to steal another man's work.

1507
02:00:45.077 --> 02:00:46.862
It takes everything.

1508
02:01:06.765 --> 02:01:09.968
No. No.
No, wait! I'm the--!

1509
02:01:15.941 --> 02:01:18.268
It took courage.

1510
02:01:20.278 --> 02:01:23.607
It took courage to climb
into that machine every night...

1511
02:01:24.241 --> 02:01:29.404
not knowing
if I'd be the man in the box...

1512
02:01:32.124 --> 02:01:33.325
or in the Prestige.

1513
02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:39.789
Do you wanna--?
Do you wanna see what it cost me?

1514
02:01:40.048 --> 02:01:43.376
You didn't see where you are, did you?

1515
02:01:43.802 --> 02:01:46.171
Look. Look.

1516
02:01:47.013 --> 02:01:49.299
I don't care.

1517
02:01:53.395 --> 02:01:56.222
You went halfway around the world.

1518
02:01:57.023 --> 02:02:00.185
You spent a fortune.

1519
02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:04.356
You did terrible things.

1520
02:02:05.323 --> 02:02:08.360
Really terrible things, Robert.

1521
02:02:09.911 --> 02:02:11.529
And all for nothing.

1522
02:02:12.581 --> 02:02:15.492
- For nothing?
- Yeah.

1523
02:02:18.670 --> 02:02:23.625
You never understood why we did this.

1524
02:02:26.344 --> 02:02:29.798
The audience knows the truth.

1525
02:02:30.182 --> 02:02:34.386
The world is simple. It's miserable.

1526
02:02:35.979 --> 02:02:38.682
Solid all the way through.

1527
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:45.188
But if you could fool them,
even for a second...

1528
02:02:46.531 --> 02:02:49.442
then you could make them wonder.

1529
02:02:50.076 --> 02:02:52.112
And then you...

1530
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:57.033
Then you got to see something
very special.

1531
02:03:00.712 --> 02:03:03.164
You really don't know?

1532
02:03:06.635 --> 02:03:12.132
It was-- It was the look on their faces.

1533
02:03:27.113 --> 02:03:32.318
<i>Every magic trick consists
of three parts or acts.</i>

1534
02:03:35.413 --> 02:03:38.825
<i>The first part is called the Pledge.</i>

1535
02:03:39.042 --> 02:03:41.911
<i>The magician shows you
something ordinary.</i>

1536
02:03:42.879 --> 02:03:46.762
<i>The second act is called the Turn.</i>

1537
02:03:46.842 --> 02:03:50.015
<i>The magician takes
the ordinary something...</i>

1538
02:03:50.095 --> 02:03:53.256
<i>and makes it into
something extraordinary.</i>

1539
02:03:54.349 --> 02:03:56.188
<i>But you wouldn't clap yet...</i>

1540
02:03:56.268 --> 02:03:59.554
<i>because making something disappear
isn't enough.</i>

1541
02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:03.683
<i>You have to bring it back.</i>

1542
02:04:07.237 --> 02:04:09.105
Hey.

1543
02:04:36.892 --> 02:04:40.178
<i>Now you're looking for the secret.</i>

1544
02:04:42.230 --> 02:04:47.352
<i>But you won't find it because,
of course, you're not really looking.</i>

1545
02:04:49.154 --> 02:04:52.440
<i>You don't really want to work it out.</i>

1546
02:04:55.327 --> 02:04:57.821
<i>You want to be fooled.</i>
