1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,840
My name is Bridget.

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:08,175
<i>I witnessed a murder.</i>

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,886
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw,

4
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,554
and we'll protect you.
You don't get it.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,058
<i>Bodaway wants me dead, I'm dead.</i>

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,436
<i>I ran to my sister,
Siobhan, for help.</i>

7
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,271
Siobhan? Siobhan!

8
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:24,191
<i>Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.</i>

9
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,651
<i>It was so easy.</i>

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,278
I saw a way out, and I took it.

11
00:00:28,444 --> 00:00:29,529
<i>They all think that I'm her.</i>

12
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:30,581
<i>Her husband...</i>

13
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:32,324
<i>I'm falling in love with Andrew.</i>

14
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,367
<i>Her stepdaughter.</i>

15
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,951
He forced himself on me!

16
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:36,662
You had sex with Mr. Carpenter?

17
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,671
<i>Her lover.</i>

18
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:39,373
Tell me what you did to my wife!

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:40,424
<i>Her best friend.</i>

20
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,334
Why are you doing this to me?!

21
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,961
Don't blame me. Blame Siobhan.

22
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,714
I told you not to kill Gemma.

23
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,965
You're not a killer, Siobhan.

24
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,390

{pub}Siobhan Martin, it has been forever!

35
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,010
Hey.

36
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,130
Jeff, good to see you.

37
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:18,430
Oh, these are for you.

38
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,500
Thank you. They're beautiful.

39
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,351
Are they peonies?

40
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:24,895
Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,523
That's Charlie's handwriting.

42
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,150
What's "pivoine"?

43
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,075
What a lovely gesture.

44
00:02:40,993 --> 00:02:43,489
What, you don't like the flowers?

45
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:46,166
That's funny, I thought
peonies were your favorite.

46
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,294
No, they're-they're stunning.
Thank you.

47
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,031
Aren't peonies out of season?

48
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,499
You must have gone through

49
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:54,925
a lot of trouble to get these.

50
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,760
Oh, anything for you.

51
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,514
You really want to do this now?

52
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,224
Jeffrey:
What do you think, ladies?

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,017
A bottle of Rothschild for the table?

54
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,178
Uh, actually, I'll pass.

55
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:06,895
I'm just gonna have water, thank you.

56
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,191
You know, actually,
I think I'll pass also.

57
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,652
Really?!

58
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:13,936
What's up with you two?

59
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,529
What is this, a cleanse or something?

60
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,864
I thought carbs were trendy again.

61
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,907
(Chuckles)

62
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,360
Our daughter would
rather drink poison

63
00:03:21,485 --> 00:03:22,912
than touch pasta.

64
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,180
Of speaking of which, how's Juliet?

65
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:25,747
Is she still going to Eastlake prep?

66
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:28,625
No, she's at Zachary Secor High.

67
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,836
The public school?
Really?

68
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,087
Greer:
Wow!

69
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,373
My foundation is hosting

70
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,742
a charity auction event for
Zachary later this week.

71
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,077
That's <i>your</i> foundation?
Yeah.

72
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,846
Well, somebody called this week
about making a donation.

73
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:41,346
I didn't realize you were involved.

74
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,889
Greer's pet project.

75
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,182
Greer:
It's such a great cause.

76
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,301
It's my passion.

77
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,352
I mean, public schools are
so underfunded,

78
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,728
and with the current
budget situation...

79
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:51,022
Okay, I won't you bore you
with the details.

80
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,860
But we are hosting a series
of events to raise money

81
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,528
for the public schools,
and Zachary is the next event.

82
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,763
I think that's great.

83
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,573
I'm a big advocate
for public schools.

84
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:01,534
And it's been great for Juliet

85
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,553
just to meet all different
kinds of kids

86
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:06,663
and see that the world
doesn't revolve around money.

87
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:11,501
What?

88
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,997
Nothing. Just... going to bat
for public schools,

89
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,798
it's so not like you.

90
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:20,837
You know, I would love
to help you with your auction.

91
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,471
It'll give us a chance
to spend some time together.

92
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:26,057
Really?

93
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:28,310
Yeah.

94
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,985
I, I really appreciate
you coming, Agent Machado.

95
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,437
No, no, I'm sorry I didn't
get back to you sooner.

96
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:39,988
I was in Wyoming
wrapping something up.

97
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,974
- Have a seat if you want.
- Thank you.

98
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:43,491
But I'm a little confused.

99
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:46,453
If this is about Gemma's case,
NYPD's handling that.

100
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,997
Yeah, uh, they barely talk
to me anymore.

101
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,648
They make me feel like I'm crazy.

102
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,450
And they're acting
like the case is closed

103
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:52,500
and they shouldn't be.

104
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:55,170
Well, what have they told you?

105
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,006
They told me Charlie Young,
or John Delario,

106
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,958
or whatever the hell
he's calling himself,

107
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,093
uh, that he shot and killed my wife

108
00:05:01,218 --> 00:05:02,552
and then he shot himself.

109
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:05,055
But that's not everything.
There's more evidence.

110
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,098
They found Bridget's fingerprints,

111
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,651
the gun that was used to kill Gemma

112
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,052
was traced back to Bridget.

113
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:12,479
So why aren't they looking for her?

114
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,358
Believe me, Mr. Butler,
I-I share your frustrations.

115
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,508
It's a complicated situation...

116
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,561
I can't get into the details...

117
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,280
But trust me when I tell you
I haven't given up.

118
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,573
I'm doing everything
I can to find Bridget.

119
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:26,792
It doesn't make any sense.

120
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,139
Gemma didn't know Bridget.

121
00:05:30,264 --> 00:05:33,249
She didn't know Charlie,
so what do they want with her?

122
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:34,877
Maybe a crime of opportunity.

123
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,528
Bridget needed money.

124
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:38,672
Kidnapping her sister's
wealthy friend

125
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,968
for a ransom may have seemed
like an easy score.

126
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,009
Siobhan...

127
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,255
Of course.

128
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,574
It all comes back to her.

129
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:49,808
Andrew:
<i>So...</i>

130
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:54,479
You and Greer working on
a fund-raiser together.

131
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,767
That's the last thing I expected.

132
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:00,068
I was just pleased
you agreed to dinner.

133
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,220
You were?

134
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,405
You usually avoid her
like the plague.

135
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,323
Makes it difficult to see Jeff.

136
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:08,727
Maybe there's something I could do.

137
00:06:08,852 --> 00:06:10,578
You know, maybe I could
apologize to her.

138
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,622
Do you have something
to apologize for?

139
00:06:12,788 --> 00:06:15,041
I never told you what happened?

140
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,702
No.

141
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,586
Do you want to talk about it?

142
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,006
Nah.

143
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:22,007
Let me just leave
the past in the past.

144
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:25,878
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you.

145
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:29,389
Do you think something's off
with Juliet?

146
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,583
She's been so... quiet.

147
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:32,601
I don't know.

148
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,686
Less... combative.

149
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,646
Isn't that a good thing?

150
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:39,725
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

151
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,377
She had a tough year.

152
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,987
It'll be good for her...
New year, back to school.

153
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,407
(Sighs)
I'm so tired.

154
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,281
You know, if you don't like the ring,

155
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:04,550
we can always trade it in.

156
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,652
Something smaller, perhaps?

157
00:07:06,777 --> 00:07:09,472
The only thing that I want
smaller is the band.

158
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,957
(Chuckles)
It keeps falling off.

159
00:07:12,082 --> 00:07:14,477
I should probably
take it to get resized.

160
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:17,563
Then the fit will be
as perfect as the rest of it.

161
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,221
Mm!

162
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,412
Thank you so much.

163
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,081
I wanted to surprise my husband,

164
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,615
but I forgot my keys.

165
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,284
No problem.

166
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,375
(Sighs)

167
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,301
(Phone rings)

168
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:09,949
Hello.

169
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,150
Hey, it's Tyler.

170
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:13,535
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

171
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,121
Siobhan?

172
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,908
Are you there?

173
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:19,749
Yeah, I'm here.

174
00:08:19,915 --> 00:08:22,627
I've been meaning to call you.

175
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,921
I thought you'd be back
in Paris by now.

176
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,259
(Gasps)

177
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,846
(Gasps)
Oh, Mrs. Martin, you scared me!

178
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,057
Claudine, I'm so sorry.

179
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,476
Oh, no, it's okay.

180
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,844
I just wasn't expecting you.

181
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:40,228
It's so early.

182
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,548
It's early for you, too.

183
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:43,648
Olivia still cracking the whip?

184
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,935
No, Ms. Charles is still in London.

185
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,354
I just like to get a jump on the day.

186
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:49,612
Can I help you with something?

187
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,575
You know, maybe you can.

188
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,867
Well, if you can keep a secret.

189
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,368
(Grunts assent)

190
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,746
I want to throw my husband
a surprise party,

191
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,032
but I can't seem to get
into his address book.

192
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:01,332
Any chance you have his password?

193
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,486
Mm. No. Sorry, I don't.

194
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:05,170
Can I help with anything else?

195
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,839
No, that's it.

196
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,207
And do me a favor,

197
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,758
let's just keep this between
each other.

198
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,676
I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise.

199
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,342
(Door shuts)

200
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,479
You okay?

201
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,609
Fine.

202
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,234
Andrew:
Oh, damn it!

203
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,029
Oh, sorry... got a presentation today,

204
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,481
and the computer guy's just canceled.

205
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,657
Come on, I'll drop you at school.

206
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,803
Actually, I'm not feeling so great.

207
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,829
I think I'm getting
that stomach thing

208
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:41,273
that's going around.

209
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:42,874
You weren't sick yesterday.

210
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,586
I started feeling badly when you
and Siobhan were at dinner.

211
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,379
You ordered a pizza.
You're fine. Come on, Juliet.

212
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:49,839
I don't have time for this today.

213
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:52,008
Car leaves in five.

214
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:54,510
Bridget:
Have a good day.

215
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:57,513
It sucks going back
after two weeks, huh?

216
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:00,892
(Elevator bell dings, phone rings)

217
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,812
You know, maybe I could talk
to your dad

218
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,022
and see if I can get him
to lighten up.

219
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,316
Whatever.

220
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,567
Just pick up your phone.

221
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,115
(Sighs)

222
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:18,977
Hello?

223
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:19,953
It's me.

224
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,614
I can't make group today.

225
00:10:21,739 --> 00:10:22,830
You should go without me.

226
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,541
Oh, actually, I can't make it either.

227
00:10:25,707 --> 00:10:28,921
You've been missing a lot
of meetings lately, bridge.

228
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,456
I'll be at the next one, I promise.

229
00:10:30,581 --> 00:10:31,874
Good.

230
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,676
I hate going alone.

231
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,843
Everyone's asking about Charlie.

232
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,095
Like they think
I can explain what he did.

233
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,138
I wish I could explain it.

234
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:42,051
I gotta go.

235
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,602
Job interview.

236
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,156
If I don't find something soon,

237
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:49,482
I may have to move on.

238
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,810
You know, Andrew mentioned something

239
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:53,229
about needing a computer guy.

240
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:55,071
Maybe you could do that.

241
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:56,198
Computer guy?

242
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:58,741
I'm computer science prof,
not a tech.

243
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:00,119
It's one afternoon.

244
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:02,160
I'll text you his number.

245
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,791
(School bell ringing)

246
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,460
What the hell are you doing here?

247
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,330
Receiving a subpar education,
same as you.

248
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,465
(Sighs)

249
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,049
Oh, my God.
What?

250
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,051
You still haven't told your
parents about Mr. Carpenter.

251
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:20,673
Juliet, he made you
have sex with him.

252
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:22,265
Okay, you have to tell them.

253
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,726
Would you keep the volume down?

254
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,377
Look I get it... I understand

255
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:26,894
that you're embarrassed or whatever,

256
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,530
but it's not your fault.

257
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,856
You need help.

258
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:32,150
No, I don't.

259
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:37,196
I just want to forget
it happened and move on.

260
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,393
Okay?

261
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:43,911
Mr. Carpenter:
I think, uh, yo.

262
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:46,706
All right.
Thanks, Mr. c.

263
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,215
Siobhan:
<i>Hey. Sorry about hanging up</i>

264
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,127
on you earlier.

265
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,470
Everything okay?

266
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,081
Yeah. I just have to take care
of one thing.

267
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:05,184
Tyler, I know you don't trust me,

268
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,885
but I'm trying to get back.

269
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,603
Well, it's a little hard to trust you

270
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,731
when you were using me
to get back at your husband.

271
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:15,477
So this thing
that you have to take care of...

272
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,946
Does it involve Andrew?

273
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,031
Have you seen him?

274
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,269
I don't want him
to know that I'm here.

275
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:25,821
Look, Martin/Charles just released

276
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,105
their year-end statements.

277
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,415
I'm just trying
to get my hands on a copy.

278
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:30,876
Tell me why.

279
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,920
You know, since we're
trusting each other.

280
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:37,249
Am I talking to Tyler Barrett,
loyal employee,

281
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:39,885
or Tyler Barrett...

282
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,761
The father of my baby?

283
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,139
How about a guy who's got

284
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,424
a high-level job at Martin/Charles?

285
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,309
If Andrew's doing something illegal,

286
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,894
I'd like to get out
before you expose him.

287
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:53,298
Okay.

288
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,601
Look, I believe that Andrew issues

289
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,281
one set of statements
to his investors,

290
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:59,195
but I think he keeps
the real ones hidden.

291
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,948
Uh, I want to get my hands
on one so I have some proof,

292
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,367
but his office security
is just too tight.

293
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,279
Can you get into your apartment

294
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:08,831
without Andrew knowing
you were there?

295
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,582
Uh, I would imagine so.

296
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,167
Why?

297
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,036
Because home security tends to be

298
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,537
more lax than office security,

299
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,047
even though we have information
in both places.

300
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:21,460
If you want to hack Andrew,
home is the place.

301
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,719
Thank you.

302
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,632
Oh, uh, Tyler, I-I have to run.

303
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:28,683
I-I... I will call you.

304
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:31,520
(Door bell jingling)

305
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,854
Henry!

306
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,652
God, it's so good to see you.

307
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,864
What are you... what are you
doing here, Siobhan?

308
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,973
Well, I... I know you always
come this way

309
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,871
after you drop the boys at
school, and I needed to see you.

310
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,872
I miss you.

311
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,158
You know who I miss?

312
00:13:53,283 --> 00:13:54,667
My wife.

313
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,797
You brought Bridget Kelly
into our lives.

314
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,048
But if it wasn't for you...

315
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,676
Gemma would be here today.

316
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,095
Wait. Please don't go.

317
00:14:06,261 --> 00:14:08,181
Henry, I can explain this.

318
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,682
Sit down with me.

319
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,436
I-I can explain everything.
I swear.

320
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,120
{pub}You have something
you want to say to me...

321
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:22,195
You say it right now.

322
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,540
I-I can't right on the street.

323
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:26,741
I mean, just...
Give me five minutes.

324
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,827
Please, I'll explain everything.

325
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:28,993
I'm busy.

326
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,763
I'm swamped with publisher meetings.

327
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,181
For your book?

328
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,800
Henry, that's great.

329
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,250
Since when do you care about my book?

330
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,355
No matter what happened,

331
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,441
I think you're an amazing writer.

332
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:42,840
You know that.

333
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,846
Save it, Siobhan.

334
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:48,180
I'm late.

335
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,472
Taxi!

336
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,903
Siobhan, are you okay?

337
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,168
Yeah.

338
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:12,370
It's just been a rough couple days.

339
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,756
(Sighs)

340
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,374
Uh, you know what?

341
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,510
Maybe I can, uh... I don't know,

342
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:19,011
maybe I can move some stuff around.

343
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:20,503
You want to meet on Friday?

344
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,298
10:00 a.M.?

345
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:24,350
Okay.

346
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,425
Usual place?

347
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:29,971
No, we don't have
a usual place anymore.

348
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,140
How about the loft?

349
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:35,651
I'll see you there.

350
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,072
Bridget Kelly's a ghost.

351
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,323
I... I can't even prove
that she was in New York

352
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:50,700
when Gemma Butler was murdered.

353
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,463
Forensics on the gun
seem pretty conclusive.

354
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:56,789
Charlie Young, aka John Delario,
was the shooter.

355
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:58,100
Yeah, I don't doubt
he killed Gemma Butler.

356
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,500
I doubt he killed himself.

357
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,586
You think someone staged the scene?

358
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,139
Angle of the gun was off.

359
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:05,590
And Delario's hands tested
positive for powder residue,

360
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:06,809
but trace amounts.

361
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:09,111
Which point to him having fired
the gun hours before,

362
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,178
and yet he died instantaneously.

363
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,149
NYPD seem to believe otherwise.

364
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,817
Yeah, because Delario
is one of their own.

365
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:16,786
They want this whole thing
to go away quickly.

366
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,312
And bringing Bridget Kelly
into it only complicates things.

367
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,814
Why would Kelly kill Delario?

368
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,793
Hell if I know.
I... (Chuckles)

369
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,078
The Bridget Kelly I knew in Wyoming

370
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,945
was not a kidnapper or a killer.

371
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,239
Okay, let's just focus

372
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,501
on what's in front of us.

373
00:16:31,626 --> 00:16:33,135
Let's try to figure out how and why

374
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,670
Bridget and Charlie became a team.

375
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,056
I mean, seriously,
how does a stripper from Wyoming

376
00:16:37,181 --> 00:16:39,425
hook up with a retired cop
from Brooklyn?

377
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:42,001
Did a little digging into your guy.

378
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,847
Traffic cam shows him
blowing through a red light

379
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:47,632
on September 8,
driving down Montauk highway.

380
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,018
John Delario was driving

381
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,844
on the main road into the
Hamptons, September 8?

382
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,096
The same weekend
Bridget Kelly was there.

383
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:55,925
Could be just a coincidence.

384
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,393
Or it could be where
this whole thing started.

385
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,664
Our new high-frequency program

386
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,200
employs computerized algorithms
that operate

387
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:07,985
at a speed unmatched
by traditional trading methods.

388
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,206
Since its implementation,

389
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:13,376
returns here at Martin/Charles
have been up over 30%.

390
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,659
Man:
Wow.

391
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,264
Now, as you can see,

392
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,167
our one-, three- and five-year
growth projections

393
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:24,085
in HFT are quite impressive.

394
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,055
What about the ten-year projection?

395
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,673
Can you hold that rate of growth?

396
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:29,108
Oh, I believe that we can.

397
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:30,393
Unfortunately,

398
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:32,478
our software designer
isn't here with us today,

399
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:35,179
so I'll have to get back to you
with specific numbers.

400
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,782
Malcolm:
Actually, Andrew,

401
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:38,901
all the data
for those projections is here.

402
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:41,020
If you'd like,
I can run a quick program,

403
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,478
figure out those numbers for you.

404
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,956
Oh. Wonderful.

405
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:45,064
Thank you, Malcolm.

406
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,960
If you wouldn't
all mind bearing with us.

407
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:48,995
Man:
Not at all.

408
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,445
(Typing)

409
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:02,206
Well, as you can see,
we can hold that rate of growth.

410
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:07,086
Bridget: <i>Okay, this should be
the last of it.</i>

411
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,231
All right, I know
this seems daunting,

412
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,184
but, uh, most of the auction
items are already labeled.

413
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,094
We just have to come up
with minimum bids

414
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,072
and sort through everything.

415
00:18:16,197 --> 00:18:17,513
Oh, and we got to figure out

416
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,825
a layout for the, uh,
night of the party.

417
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,059
Okay, that sounds like a lot.

418
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:24,519
I'm happy to help.

419
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:29,402
I know it must seem weird,
my offering to help.

420
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:32,421
I... I realize things have been...

421
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:34,447
Strained between us.

422
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,093
To be honest, I was shocked

423
00:18:37,218 --> 00:18:38,928
that you actually followed through.

424
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,680
I thought you were just putting on

425
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:42,496
a good face for our husbands.

426
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:46,152
I really want things to
be better between us.

427
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:49,253
I mean, we were friends once, right?

428
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,974
I thought we were.

429
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:53,841
Until that weekend.

430
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,345
You know, maybe if we
talked about it...

431
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,765
You know what?
We did enough talking.

432
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,100
Or at least you did.

433
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,142
You practically threatened me.

434
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,144
I never said anything
about what I saw,

435
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,160
so I just would like that
to be the end of it.

436
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:12,478
Greer, I'm not the person
that I used to be, and...

437
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:16,332
I'm definitely not the
person I was that weekend.

438
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:19,408
I-I hope you'll give me
the chance to prove it.

439
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:21,285
(Elevator bell dings,
doors slide open)

440
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,329
Juliet:
Hey.

441
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,266
Didn't realize you had company.

442
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,145
Juliet, you remember Mrs. Sheridan?

443
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,961
She's in charge
of your school benefit.

444
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:32,098
Hi, Juliet.

445
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,714
- It's good to see you again.
- Hi.

446
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,634
You know what?
I really should get going.

447
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,551
Are you okay with everything here?

448
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:39,905
Not a problem.
Great.

449
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,775
And, Greer,
I-I would love to revisit this,

450
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,944
you know, sometime,
if you're willing to...

451
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:46,268
(Elevator bell dings)

452
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,114
Hey, so this, uh, thing

453
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:49,647
you're doing tomorrow night,

454
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:53,150
you're not going
to make me go, are you?

455
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:55,487
Well, considering it's 20 feet
from your bedroom,

456
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:58,072
I was hoping you would at least
put in an appearance.

457
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,992
- What?
- I offered up the apartment.

458
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,909
They wanted an intimate setting.

459
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,345
It's not that big a deal.

460
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,548
I mean, it's just some
board members and their guests

461
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:07,748
and a few people from your school.

462
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,084
You mean, like, teachers?

463
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,965
Please tell me you
didn't invite Mr. Carpenter.

464
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,341
I thought he was your favorite.

465
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,394
No.

466
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,012
No. There's no way.

467
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:21,971
I'm not going
to your stupid fund-raiser.

468
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,807
Juliet, what's wrong?
Nothing.

469
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,371
It's just...

470
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:33,649
I have to see my stupid teachers
every day at school,

471
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,027
and now I have to deal
with them in my own house?

472
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:38,497
You were a great help today.

473
00:20:38,622 --> 00:20:41,240
Never seen anyone
write code so quickly.

474
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,219
Claudine will give you a call

475
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:45,494
when she cuts your check.

476
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,540
You know, if you ever feel
like changing fields,

477
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:50,374
give me a call.

478
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,377
We could use someone like you.

479
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:53,846
Wow.

480
00:20:53,971 --> 00:20:55,462
I'm flattered.

481
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,486
(Distant siren wailing)

482
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,861

483
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:20,529
Ah, thank you, Jessie.

484
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,124
Jessie:
You're welcome, sir.

485
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:24,408
(Indistinct conversation)

486
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:25,377
Yes, sir.
Okay, see you later.

487
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:27,002
Thank you, sir.

488
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,585
Hey, Henry, it's me.

489
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,856
I-I might be a few minutes late,
but I'm coming, so...

490
00:21:36,981 --> 00:21:39,598
Wait for me, please.

491
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,651

Yeah.

Hang on.
Y-you're breaking up.

503
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,602
Mm-hmm. Go ahead.

504
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,137
Look, could you talk slower?

505
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,897
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

506
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,770
Look, we should make sure
we get a better line

507

if you're gonna patch him through.

Mm.

John, how are you?

Good.

Right.

515
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,462
I'll check when I'm back
in the office.

516
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,139
Excellent.
So you're happy?

517
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,174
Wonderful, wonderful.
That's great news.

518

00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,510
Okay, thanks.
Talk to you soon.

Bye.

00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,346
I didn't expect you to be here.

Andrew:
I forgot my briefcase.

that thing chained to your wrist.

(Andrew chuckles)

525
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,468
Did you get a chance
to talk to Juliet?

526
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:40,737
I did. And she swore
that everything was fine.

527
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:42,606
Even promised to make an
appearance at the party tonight.

528
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,649
Bridget:
Really?

529
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,818
I guess I overreacted.

530
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,446
She was just acting so funny
when I mentioned that teacher.

531
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,573
Maybe he gave her a bad grade.

532
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,834
You buy a new dress yet?

533
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,869
Bridget:
I've got it narrowed down to three.

534
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:59,373
But I can't decide if I want
to go big or understated

535
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,757
to show off the amazing ring

536
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:03,633
that my impossibly handsome
husband gave me.

537
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,048

Doesn't matter what dress you choose,

Because you couldn't stop calling me.

619
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:35,992
I didn't call you.

620
00:30:36,117 --> 00:30:37,878
Did someone call you from my number?

621
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,597
No, the number was blocked, but I...

622

gonna do this to me again?

at <i>the new yorker</i> today,

625
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,180
and I missed it because
of you, Siobhan.

626
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,439
Wait, Henry, calm down...

627
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:51,441

I am done with you.

00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:53,510
I do not want to see you,
I don't want to think about you,

629

to talk to you again.

You okay?

636
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,678
Yeah, I'm fine.

637
00:31:31,772 --> 00:31:34,601
Henry seemed pretty upset.

638
00:31:36,276 --> 00:31:38,388
Yeah, he's not doing so well.

639

643
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:56,923
No.

00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,459
Greer, I-I know I have no right
to ask you this, but...

645
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,761
If I didn't say anything
after that weekend,

646
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,263
I'm not going to now.

647
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,601
That weekend
where we stopped speaking was

648
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:11,596
because you found out
about the affair.

649
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,723
It didn't just
destroy our friendship.

650
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,926
It ruined my relationship with Gemma.

651
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:20,597
You know, I couldn't look her
in the eye after that.

652
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:22,190
I hated you for that.

653
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,987
I don't blame you.

654
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,738
And I'm sorry.

655
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:32,242
More sorry than I know
how to put into words.

656
00:32:36,303 --> 00:32:37,631
You know, I have to admit,

657
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:40,125
it's been really great
working with you this week.

658
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,420
I've had a good time, too.

659
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,556
I just have to ask...

660
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:49,175
The flowers you brought
to dinner the other night...?

661
00:32:49,341 --> 00:32:52,629
I was just being a bitch.

662
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:55,482
I couldn't believe that
you actually said yes to dinner,

663
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,767
and I wanted to throw you
off your game.

664
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,653
I'm sorry.

665
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,104
It's okay.

666
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,972
(Sighs)

667
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:05,442
Who would've thought flowers
could mean so much?

668
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,027
Yeah, well, I can't

669
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,613
see peonies without
thinking about that weekend.

670
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,082
They were all over
the hotel, remember?

671
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,491
Hotel pivoine.

672
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,455
You know, I go to Boston
all the time,

673
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,291
and I don't go anywhere near
that hotel anymore.

674
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,452
(Talking, laughing)

675
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,800
You sure she's young enough for you?

676
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:32,802
'cause...

677
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:35,021
I know your type.

678
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,346
And she's not it.

679
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:43,029
Excuse me.

680
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,031
Juliet.

681
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,941
I think, uh, you and I should talk...

682
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:48,777
Don't touch me!

683
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,236
I got it.

684
00:33:50,402 --> 00:33:52,188
I'm fine.

685
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:55,033
You, young lady, are drunk.

686
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,859
You're boring.

687
00:33:56,984 --> 00:33:58,953
And so are all your stupid friends.

688
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,790
Andrea, it's time for you to go home.

689
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,917
Judith's turning in for the night.

690
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,209
Right now.

691
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,796
(Knocking on door)

692
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:12,008
Hey.

693
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,764
Your dad told me what happened.

694
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,718
I know I ruined your party.

695
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,520
I get it, I'm a total screw-up.

696
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,065
Juliet, I don't care about the party.

697
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,567
(Sniffles)

698
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,028
You know, I've ruined
my fair share of parties

699

drinking too much.

700
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:36,082
True story.

701
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,284
But usually when I did it,
there was a reason.

702
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,830
Juliet, I know something's going on.

703
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:45,250
Please, try and talk to me.

704
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:51,097
The other day...

705
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,422
When I mentioned Mr. Carpenter...

706
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,060
Did something happen between you two?

707
00:35:09,648 --> 00:35:11,774
(Talking indistinctly)

708
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,613
Carpenter.

710
00:35:24,142 --> 00:35:25,373
{pub}What the hell is your problem?

711
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:27,125
- Get out of my house.
- What's going on?

712
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,253
If you come near my stepdaughter
again, I will kill you!

713
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,589
Juliet, what is she talking about?

714
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,549
Get out, now!

715
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,878
Woman:
What?

Oh, God.

719
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:06,498
I don't want to talk about it.

720
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,833
Juliet...

721
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,543
Don't even.

722
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:18,051
Why did you do that in front
of all those people?

723
00:36:20,302 --> 00:36:23,001
All I wanted

724
00:36:23,126 --> 00:36:24,586
was to forget about what happened,

725
00:36:24,711 --> 00:36:26,476
and now the whole world knows.

726
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,041
I am so sorry.

727
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,192
I wasn't thinking.

728
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:32,273
I was just so angry
I couldn't see straight.

729
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,603
No kidding.

730
00:36:35,471 --> 00:36:37,070
Just get out.

731
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:50,012
Daddy, please.

732
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,918
Leave me alone.

733
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:24,284
{pub}Want some coffee?

734
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,718
Uh, no, actually.

735
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,704
I just wanted to
ask you a couple questions.

736
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,806
Great. I love questions.

737
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:32,125
Way more than tips.

738
00:37:33,266 --> 00:37:35,844
I'm investigating
this man... John Delario.

739
00:37:35,969 --> 00:37:37,255
He also goes by Charlie Young.

740
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,340
I know he was in
the area in September,

741
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,517
but what I need to know
is if anyone saw him with her.

742
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:43,219
Name's Bridget Kelly.

743
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,605
They were in here, once.

744
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,683
But not in September. May.

745
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,853
That can't be right.
Bridget was in Wyoming in may.

746
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,022
Okay, then.

747
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,280
You sure it was may?

748
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,166
I'm positive.
It was on my birthday.

749
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,618
I was trying to get out early,
but she was a bitch.

750
00:37:59,743 --> 00:38:02,405
Waved me down every two seconds,
and then stiffed me on the tip.

751
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:04,390
Remember anything else?

752
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,657
What they talked about, maybe?

753
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:08,260
The guy said her name once,
and she shut him down quick.

754
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:09,787
He called her something weird.

755
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:12,070
I never heard it before.

756
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:14,292
He call her Siobhan?

757
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,734
That's it.

758
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:17,102
What kind of a name is that?

759
00:38:17,227 --> 00:38:18,796
Man:
Excuse me, miss?

760
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,827
John Delario...

761
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:29,098
What the hell were you doing
with Siobhan Martin?

762
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,892
(Typing)

763
00:38:56,299 --> 00:38:58,086
How'd it go at the police station?

764
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,813
Can I talk about it later?

765
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,298
I need to speak with Juliet.

766
00:39:03,423 --> 00:39:05,510
She's still in her room.

767
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,776
She won't come out.

768
00:39:08,811 --> 00:39:11,973
But I was able to slip her
a tray of food, so...

769
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:13,726
That was a start.

770
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,913
Andrew...

771
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:21,734
I'm really sorry about
decking Carpenter.

772
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,368
I just...

773
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,030
Felt this need to protect Juliet.

774
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:28,296
Like a mother would.

775
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:31,993
I'm not angry at you, Siobhan.

776
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:34,163
I'm the one who failed her.

777
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,665
I should've seen what was going on.

778
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,183
Wait, no, she did
everything she could

779
00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:39,752
to keep you from finding out.

780
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:41,002
But you knew.

781
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:42,296
And you tried to tell me.

782
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:44,506
I knew that something was off,

783
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:45,941
that was it.

784
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:47,342
It didn't stop me
from telling everyone

785
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,303
how great she was doing
at her new school.

786
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:53,071
We can't sit here
and beat ourselves up.

787
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:55,484
I've done too much of that
in my life,

788
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:56,685
it doesn't get you anywhere.

She took the boys out for dessert.

797
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,630
Yeah, I know that.

798
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:27,889
I know you're angry at me.

799
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:31,019
I've been acting like
a different person,

800
00:40:31,144 --> 00:40:32,263
and it doesn't make sense.

801
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,390
Get out.

802
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:35,924
No.

803
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:38,978
Please, hear me out.

I'm sorry for yesterday.

805
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:49,037

and the last few months.

Because yesterday you wanted
nothing to do with me.

00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:07,756
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

You are in charge.

Who was the person
at the party yesterday?

who's standing here
in front of me right now.

827
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:39,080
