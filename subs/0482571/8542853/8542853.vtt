calls his trick The Transported man.

You will see no trickery,

871
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.894

872
01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:21.337
Merely a technique familiar
to certain citizens of the Orient

873

and various holy men of the Himalayas.

874
01:00:26.846 --> 01:00:29.872
Indeed, many of you may be
familiar with this technique,

875
01:00:29.949 --> 01:00:33.112
but for those of you who
are not, do not be alarmed.

The manager says he's
never seen a reaction like it.

881
01:01:13.793 --> 01:01:17.092
At least he saw it. I spent
the ovation hiding under the stage.

882
01:01:17.163 --> 01:01:19.495
No one cares about
the man who disappears.

883
01:01:19.565 --> 01:01:21.556
They care about the one who comes out.

884
01:01:21.634 --> 01:01:23.693
I care about the man in the box.

885
01:01:23.769 --> 01:01:28.069
Thank you. I don't know,
maybe we could switch before the trick.

886
01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:30.301
I'm the prestige,
and Root's below stage.

887
01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:33.311
No, the anticipation
of the trick is everything.

888
01:01:33.379 --> 01:01:36.439
We need your showmanship
to build up the suspense.

889
01:01:36.515 --> 01:01:40.076
Once Root opens his mouth, it's over.
He can't introduce this trick.

890
01:01:40.152 --> 01:01:42.882
Of course I can. I'm the Great Danton.

891
01:01:42.955 --> 01:01:46.550
Root, you bloody fool,
get out of that wardrobe and makeup.

892

Congratulations, all.

No, it's the trick.
It isn't good enough.

898
01:02:05.578 --> 01:02:08.911
BORDEN's trick is nothing
compared to ours. He has no style.

899
01:02:08.981 --> 01:02:12.849
He doesn't spend the finale
hiding under the stage.

900
01:02:12.918 --> 01:02:15.819
- I need to know how he does it.
- Why?

901
01:02:15.888 --> 01:02:18.379
So I can do it better.

902
01:02:20.459 --> 01:02:22.927
I need you to go and work for him.

903
01:02:25.965 --> 01:02:27.694
Work for him? Are you joking?

01:02:28.968 --> 01:02:30.162
You'll be my spy.

That's how we advance. Think of it.

version. Imagine what we'd do

908
01:02:37.943 --> 01:02:42.380
with the real illusion. We'd have the
greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.

01:02:42.448 --> 01:02:46.214
- He knows I work for you.
- Exactly why he'll want to hire you.

910
01:02:46.285 --> 01:02:48.845
- He'll want my secret.
- Why would he trust me?

Because you're
gonna tell him the truth.

doing the trick until Borden opens,
