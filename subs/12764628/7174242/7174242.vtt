[crickets chirp]

4
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.374
[Isaac] I trust the
money is on its way.

5
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:28.307
[Olga] Mm.

00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.841
- [footsteps approaching]
- [door creaks]

00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:38.875
[breathes heavily]

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.207
[whooshing]

9
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.441
[Isaac] Here it is.

10
00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:48.540
The oldest Jack in the box...

11
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.708
ever discovered.

12
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.341
The original

13
00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:56.573
Jack in the box.

14
00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:03.374
I believe this is the very
one you've been looking for.

15
00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:05.808
Yes.

16
00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:09.507
This is the one.

17
00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.142
Finding it wasn't easy.

18
00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:22.875
This box was linked to a
murder case a few years back.

19
00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:27.540
Some nut in Hawthorne drove
its value on the black market

20
00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:31.174
through the roof with
his... ghost stories.

21
00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:36.741
Some sick-minded collectors
would bleed themselves dry

22
00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:39.207
to get their hands
on a thing like this.

23
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:43.507
Thankfully, none of
them have pockets

24
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.641
quite as deep as yours.

25
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.540
This will be a
wonderful addition

26
00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:56.075
to our vintage
toy collection.

27
00:01:58.108 --> 00:01:59.941
It will take pride of place.

28
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:12.608
Mr. Huxley, can I ask you
not to smoke that in here?

29
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.108
You can ask all you like,

30
00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:17.207
but I don't take
orders from the help.

31
00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:19.808
[Olga] Do as he says.

32
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.708
Or that briefcase will
get a whole lot lighter.

33
00:02:26.574 --> 00:02:29.341
[Isaac chuckles]

34
00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:38.241
I'm no servant.

35
00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:43.075
You sure fooled me.

36
00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:50.241
[door creaks]

37
00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:53.174
[footsteps recede]

38
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.108
He'll get what he deserves.

39
00:03:04.207 --> 00:03:05.675
I'll put this on display.

40
00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:06.541
Leave it.

41
00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.340
I wish to be left alone now.

42
00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:17.075
All right. I'll take
it down in the morning.

43
00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:20.174
Can I get you anything?

44
00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:22.574
- Goodnight.
- [slow string music]

45
00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:24.941
Goodnight.

46
00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:30.440
Sleep well, Mother.

47
00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:31.741

[box clicks]

56
00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:27.608
[Isaac] Keys.

57
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:29.474
Keys!

[brooding orchestral music]

84
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.808
[Chauffeur] It's quite
a sight, isn't it?

85
00:07:58.741 --> 00:07:59.941
[Amy] It certainly is.

86
00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:08.841
- [keys clink]
- [distant crow caws]

87
00:08:10.008 --> 00:08:12.608
[box crackles]

88
00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:19.307
It always takes them a lifetime
to open these old gates.

89
00:08:20.474 --> 00:08:22.341
We'd break into
Fort Knox quicker.

90
00:08:22.374 --> 00:08:24.307
[Amy chuckles]

91
00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:25.741

[Amy chuckles]

101
00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:28.574
Welcome, Amy.

102
00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:31.608
Thank you.

103
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:35.908
You must be Edgar. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

104
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.608
This place is incredible.

105
00:09:39.908 --> 00:09:40.841
It certainly is.

106
00:09:42.108 --> 00:09:44.207
I often forget how lucky we are.

107
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:46.875
This has been home to
Mother and I for 20 years.

108
00:09:47.974 --> 00:09:49.974
I'm not used to luxuries.

109
00:09:50.908 --> 00:09:53.174
She never spares expense.

110
00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:54.441
Is your mother here?

111
00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:56.274
I'd really like to thank
her for the opportunity.

112
00:10:02.108 --> 00:10:03.775
She won't want to be disturbed.

113
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.675
She's been bed bound
for some time now.

114
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.307
[Amy] That's awful.

115
00:10:10.474 --> 00:10:13.541
She has osteosarcoma.
Cancer of the bones.

116
00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:17.374
The agony she feels with
each movement, it's uh...

117
00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:20.075
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

118
00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:25.474
She's been seen by every doctor,
every expert we could find.

119
00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:31.608
She was given roughly
six months to live.

120
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:32.874
That was five months ago.

121
00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:41.641
But I'll never give up on her.

122
00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:42.474
She's a fighter.

123
00:10:49.108 --> 00:10:51.508
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

124
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.474
Please, come in.

125
00:10:58.474 --> 00:10:59.708
[car starts]

126
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:01.241
Your duties here
are all focused on

127
00:11:01.274 --> 00:11:03.675
the general upkeep of the manor.

128
00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:05.675
Mainly cleaning and ironing.

129
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:06.874
I'll brief you every morning

130
00:11:06.907 --> 00:11:08.741
with the tasks
for the day ahead.

131
00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:10.274
Your room is on the first floor.

132
00:11:10.307 --> 00:11:12.940
The floor is shared with your
colleagues, Janet and Frank.

133
00:11:12.974 --> 00:11:15.541
My mother and I
occupy the top floor.

134
00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.307
We don't charge for the room,

135
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:19.641
or even any meals
you're provided with.

136
00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:23.008
You are treated in many
ways as one of the family.

137
00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:28.174
All we ask in return is that
you follow our rules, strictly.

138
00:11:32.008 --> 00:11:32.807
Have a read.

139
00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:38.142
I, uh, I think you'll agree
the role pays quite handsomely.

140
00:11:42.574 --> 00:11:45.075
Quite? [chuckles]

141
00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.641
A nine o'clock curfew?

142
00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:53.142
No one comes in or
out of those gates

143
00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:54.508
from nine PM onwards.

144
00:11:56.008 --> 00:11:57.708
I don't fancy your chances
over those 10-foot walls,

145
00:11:57.741 --> 00:12:00.441
so please, make sure you're
on this side of the gates

146
00:12:00.474 --> 00:12:04.108
at sunset and we
won't have a problem.

147
00:12:08.374 --> 00:12:11.042
[paper flicks]

148
00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:16.075
Well?

149
00:12:19.874 --> 00:12:22.441
[Amy chuckles]

150
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:29.174
[Amy sighs]

151
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.508
Welcome to Rosewood Manor.

152
00:12:41.142 --> 00:12:42.341
Good morning, Mother.

153
00:12:42.374 --> 00:12:45.142
- Oh, my god! [gasps]
- [dramatic music]

154
00:12:46.907 --> 00:12:50.840
- [door slams]
- [breathes sharply]

155
00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:52.908
Mr. Huxley is dead.

156
00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:55.740
How?

157
00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:56.774
Who did this?

158
00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:01.174
This box, Edgar.

159
00:13:03.274 --> 00:13:05.374
It's not what you think it is.

160
00:13:06.908 --> 00:13:10.908
It was built to contain
something not of this world.

161
00:13:14.142 --> 00:13:14.975
A demon.

162
00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:19.008
By opening the box,

163
00:13:20.274 --> 00:13:21.374
I have released it.

164
00:13:23.274 --> 00:13:25.142
And if it gets what it wants,

165
00:13:25.174 --> 00:13:28.541
it has the power to
rid me of my illness.

166
00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:31.374
I will be healthy once again.

167
00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:35.042
What does it want?

168
00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.807
Six sacrifices.

169
00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:42.008
And I will live.

170
00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:46.307
[Edgar sighs]

171
00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:49.075
This is insane. This is insane.

172
00:13:50.374 --> 00:13:53.908
I need your help.

173
00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:54.774
Edgar.

174
00:13:56.008 --> 00:13:58.641
None of the staff are
to leave the grounds.

175
00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:03.508
You must keep them here by
whatever means necessary.

176
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:04.374
To die?

177
00:14:05.608 --> 00:14:08.374
It needs five more victims.

178
00:14:10.807 --> 00:14:12.908
You must bring
more to the manor.

179
00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:16.374
I'm not sure I can do this.

180
00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:20.908
We've done the
impossible before.

181
00:14:23.174 --> 00:14:25.274
You're stronger than you know.

182
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.740
Will you help me, Edgar?

183
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:43.941
Of course I will.

184
00:14:43.975 --> 00:14:47.307
[dark orchestral music]

185
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:50.008
You know that.

00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:35.174
[Isaac] Is anybody there?

[suspenseful orchestral music]

192
00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:43.941
You've gotta help me.

193
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:47.374
Mr. Huxley?

194
00:16:16.274 --> 00:16:18.741
[Isaac] You've gotta
help me outta here!

195
00:16:18.775 --> 00:16:20.875
I'm begging you, have mercy.

196
00:16:28.808 --> 00:16:31.307

[box rattles]

199
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.641
Open the box, Edgar.

200
00:17:23.573 --> 00:17:24.775
Why should I help you?

201
00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:29.341
[Isaac] Have mercy. I'm
begging you, have mercy.

202
00:17:31.075 --> 00:17:33.008
Let me out, Edgar! Now!

203
00:17:34.108 --> 00:17:38.042
[tense orchestral music]

00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:55.975
Let me out!

208
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.108
It won't open!

209
00:18:05.142 --> 00:18:06.408
[Isaac] Let me out!

210
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:11.440

[Machine] The person whom
you're trying to reach

213
00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.008
is currently unavailable.

214
00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:58.008
Please leave your
message after the...

215
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:06.808
[sighs] Come on.

216
00:19:14.174 --> 00:19:15.207
- [vase shatters]
- [gasps]

217
00:19:18.675 --> 00:19:21.174
[Janet] That vase was only
worth about a grand.

218
00:19:22.407 --> 00:19:24.608
Don't worry. I'll
tell Edgar I did it.

219
00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:27.142
I've been here way to long
to get kicked out now.

220
00:19:27.174 --> 00:19:28.741
Thanks.

221
00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:32.174
I'm Janet, by the way. I'm
on housekeeping duty, too.

222
00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:34.841
Frank. I'm the chef.

223
00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:37.008
It's great to meet you both.

224
00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.975
So, everything all right so far?

225
00:19:40.241 --> 00:19:43.108
Yeah. So far so good.

226
00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:44.941
Where's the house phone?

227
00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.641
I just, I can't get
any signal anywhere

228
00:19:46.675 --> 00:19:48.241
and I could do
with making a call.

229
00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:49.941
[Frank chuckles]

230
00:19:49.975 --> 00:19:51.307
What?

231
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.541
Uh...

232
00:19:52.574 --> 00:19:54.841
Yeah, there's no
house phone here.

233
00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:56.775
And honestly, good
luck getting a signal,

234
00:19:56.808 --> 00:19:59.941
'cause I've tried many times.

235
00:19:59.975 --> 00:20:02.708
I just, I need to
call my boyfriend.

236
00:20:02.741 --> 00:20:05.541
Well, my ex.

237
00:20:05.574 --> 00:20:08.641
Is there a computer here?
I could send an email.

238
00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:09.508
Nope.

239
00:20:12.574 --> 00:20:14.574
There's no internet, either?

240
00:20:14.608 --> 00:20:18.108
Welcome to the 1800s,
lovely. [chuckles]

241
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:22.508
He's out of sight, out of mind.

242
00:20:23.808 --> 00:20:25.373
It's a blessing in disguise.

243
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:30.174
Trust me. [chuckles]

244
00:20:30.207 --> 00:20:31.042
Check.

245
00:20:32.042 --> 00:20:34.541
[Janet sighs]

246
00:20:35.975 --> 00:20:37.108
Oh, come on.

247
00:20:37.142 --> 00:20:38.941
I've got you cornered.
It's all over.

248
00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:44.541
Can I have a go?

249
00:20:47.941 --> 00:20:48.741
Please do.

250
00:20:49.941 --> 00:20:51.441
I'm not very good
at this chess lark.

251
00:20:52.641 --> 00:20:54.075
Let's see what you
got, city girl.

252
00:21:03.075 --> 00:21:08.075
- [suspenseful music]
- [muffled wind howls]

253
00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:20.975
Oh, you're just gonna
run around the board

254
00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:22.108
all night, aren't you?

255
00:21:24.008 --> 00:21:26.574
I'll be honest, you didn't
strike me as a chess player.

256
00:21:26.608 --> 00:21:27.441
[Amy] Why?

257
00:21:28.908 --> 00:21:31.108
Well, you don't meet many
attractive chess players.

258
00:21:32.373 --> 00:21:35.741
- Thanks.
- [Frank chuckles]

259
00:21:35.775 --> 00:21:37.574
There wasn't much else
to do but play games,

260
00:21:37.608 --> 00:21:38.975
growing up in an orphanage.

261
00:21:41.374 --> 00:21:43.240
When I started
beating the adults,

262
00:21:43.273 --> 00:21:45.174
out-thinking people
twice my age,

263
00:21:45.206 --> 00:21:47.741
it gave me the belief that
I could plan an escape.

264
00:21:49.206 --> 00:21:50.574
You escaped the orphanage?

265
00:21:52.108 --> 00:21:54.042
[Amy] But I came straight
back the next day.

266
00:21:54.075 --> 00:21:55.708
[Janet chuckles]

267
00:21:55.741 --> 00:21:56.541
[Janet] Why?

268
00:21:57.741 --> 00:22:00.075
I just needed to prove
to myself that I could.

269
00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:02.340
From that point on, I
was no longer afraid

270
00:22:02.374 --> 00:22:03.374
of where I'd end up.

271
00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:08.206
I took comfort knowing
that if I ended up

272
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.841
in a bad situation with a
family that mistreated me,

273
00:22:13.975 --> 00:22:15.641
I could find my way
out of anywhere.

274
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:19.173
Checkmate.

275
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.508
[Janet and Frank chuckle]

276
00:22:26.541 --> 00:22:27.374
Yes!

277
00:22:28.808 --> 00:22:32.008
I think she's gonna fit
in just fine around here.

278
00:22:32.042 --> 00:22:32.841
Don't you?

279
00:22:36.042 --> 00:22:38.775
[crickets chirp]

280
00:22:48.775 --> 00:22:51.741
- Come on!
- Shh, keep your voice down.

281
00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:53.541

282
00:22:53.574 --> 00:22:56.206

[switch clicks]

285
00:23:07.341 --> 00:23:09.206
I hate those creaky floorboards.

286
00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:16.508
Are you sure they didn't see us?

287
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:17.741
Yes. I'm sure.

288
00:23:29.775 --> 00:23:32.008

289
00:23:36.808 --> 00:23:37.641
Shh.

[box chimes melodically]

291
00:24:00.341 --> 00:24:01.875
You're so paranoid.

292
00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:05.274
You look pretty scared, too.

293
00:24:05.307 --> 00:24:08.107
- [scoffs] I don't get scared.
- [Janet chuckles]

294
00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:09.341
- Liar.
- Mm-hm.

298
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:24.574
- What?
- I can't do this.

299
00:24:25.975 --> 00:24:27.574
I'm sorry. My mind, it's racing.

300
00:24:29.173 --> 00:24:31.675
[Frank sighs]

301
00:24:33.173 --> 00:24:34.008
Fine.

302
00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:36.274
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:40.241
Yeah.

It has killed again, hasn't it?

00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:57.840
[Edgar] Frank is dead.

355
00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:04.840
[Olga] Every life the demon
takes increases its strength.

356

And as it gets stronger-

357
00:28:08.675 --> 00:28:09.541
So do you.

358
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.042

You won't let me
down, will you, Edgar?

363
00:28:32.574 --> 00:28:33.408
Hm?

364
00:28:35.741 --> 00:28:39.574
The demon must continue
to get what it wants.

365
00:28:42.775 --> 00:28:44.042
We're gonna finish this.

00:28:49.907 --> 00:28:52.108
I won't rest until
it kills four more.

368
00:28:55.408 --> 00:29:00.142
Whatever it takes, Mother,
I'm gonna keep you alive.

369
00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.408
I promise.

[door closes]

375
00:29:42.508 --> 00:29:46.274
You should've told me
that you were coming.

376
00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:49.908
Do you always wear that?

377
00:29:53.474 --> 00:29:54.274
Wear what?

378
00:29:55.641 --> 00:29:56.840
That perfume.

379
00:29:58.042 --> 00:30:00.108
I bought that for you
for special occasions.

380
00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:04.807
Look, Edgar, I'll see
you tomorrow, okay?

381
00:30:05.941 --> 00:30:08.840
- I need to talk to you.
- [suspenseful music]

382
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:10.975
I have to tell you something.

383
00:30:11.008 --> 00:30:14.307
It's killing me, keeping
it to myself. Please.

384
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:29.740
I think you should
look at trying

385
00:30:29.774 --> 00:30:31.274
to get some professional help.

386
00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:35.374
I've never seen you
like this before.

387
00:30:37.674 --> 00:30:40.341
You used to be so happy
and so full of life.

388
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:46.674
I want that Edgar back.

389
00:30:48.508 --> 00:30:49.307
My Edgar.

390
00:30:52.474 --> 00:30:53.975
Not the one that she makes you.

391
00:30:56.508 --> 00:30:58.042
What do you mean?

392
00:30:59.174 --> 00:31:01.075
Look, I'm not
trying to upset you.

393
00:31:01.108 --> 00:31:02.574
What do you mean?

394
00:31:14.574 --> 00:31:17.075
[sighs] I don't like the
way your mother treats you.

395
00:31:18.908 --> 00:31:23.108
You've spent so much time
caring for her recently,

396
00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:25.841
you change.

397
00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:30.808
The more time you spend
around her, you...

398
00:31:32.707 --> 00:31:35.307
You become someone else.

399
00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:37.508
She gave up everything for me.

400
00:31:41.307 --> 00:31:44.274
If she had told the police
the truth about what I did,

401
00:31:47.707 --> 00:31:49.075
my life would be over,

402
00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:52.241
before it even began.

403
00:31:56.307 --> 00:32:00.474
- I'm forever in her debt.

do with a nice cup of tea.

He left the manor
last night, so,

435
00:36:39.941 --> 00:36:42.108
I will prepare Mother's
breakfast myself.

I'm just keeping you on
your toes. [chuckles]

445

What the hell is that thing?

446
00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:44.808
Some sort of antique
Jack in a box, I guess.

447
00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:47.206
It's a new one.

448
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.941
Olga's always had a taste
for weird collectible stuff.

449
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.042
Not much of a looker,
though, is he?

450
00:38:54.408 --> 00:38:55.675
Look at those eyes!

451
00:38:57.408 --> 00:39:00.173
[laughs]

452
00:39:00.206 --> 00:39:02.374
I'm sorry, okay?

453
00:39:02.408 --> 00:39:05.075
I wouldn't have done it if I
knew it'd bother you this much.

454
00:39:08.008 --> 00:39:11.142
I assume Edgar told
you about Frank?

455
00:39:15.908 --> 00:39:16.741
Yeah.

456
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.408
Yeah, I woke up to a note
outside my door. [chuckles]

457
00:39:22.441 --> 00:39:24.141
He said he was
missing home, so...

458
00:39:25.508 --> 00:39:27.374
Had he talked about
leaving before?

459
00:39:33.273 --> 00:39:34.975
We talked about
leaving every day.

460
00:39:37.008 --> 00:39:38.675
But we were gonna
do it together.

461
00:39:40.206 --> 00:39:41.608
We were gonna start a business

462
00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:45.108
and secretly I hoped
we'd start a family, too.

463
00:39:49.374 --> 00:39:50.474
I just don't get it.

464
00:39:51.975 --> 00:39:53.875
Frank hated going home.

465
00:39:57.173 --> 00:39:59.408
I clearly didn't know
him as well as I thought.

466
00:40:02.107 --> 00:40:04.441
He didn't care about me
as much as I thought.

467
00:40:07.574 --> 00:40:09.173
I'm sorry, Janet.

468
00:40:11.508 --> 00:40:13.975
Like I said. [chuckles]

469
00:40:14.008 --> 00:40:16.240
Out of sight.

470
00:40:16.274 --> 00:40:17.274
Out of mind.

You are consumed by
guilt, aren't you?

474
00:40:49.274 --> 00:40:51.908
We are on the cusp
of a miracle, yet,

475
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:53.808
you feel guilt over them.

476
00:40:54.841 --> 00:40:57.408
A salesman and a cook.

477
00:40:57.441 --> 00:41:01.474
[Edgar] They are people. Flesh
and blood, like you and I.

478
00:41:01.508 --> 00:41:03.241
[Olga] They are nothing like us.

479
00:41:06.206 --> 00:41:08.374
What happens when people
go looking for them?

480
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:11.741
What happens when
they come here?

481
00:41:11.775 --> 00:41:15.408
When all this is over,
we will start again.

482
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:21.008
Somewhere so far from here,
no one will ever find us.

483
00:41:23.107 --> 00:41:25.207
We've done it before,
we will do it again.

484
00:41:32.574 --> 00:41:33.941
But that's not all, is it?

485
00:41:35.374 --> 00:41:37.307
- I'm fine.
- Don't lie to me, boy!

486
00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:51.141
It's that girl you've
been seeing, isn't it? Hm?

487
00:41:52.708 --> 00:41:53.508
Stacey.

488
00:41:56.374 --> 00:41:57.941
[Edgar] I don't want
to talk about it.

489
00:41:57.975 --> 00:41:59.441
[Olga] Oh.

490
00:41:59.474 --> 00:42:01.875
Whatever she's done, she's
not good enough for you.

491
00:42:01.908 --> 00:42:04.041
- None of them are.
- That's enough, Mother!

492
00:42:08.374 --> 00:42:09.875
I'm sorry.

493
00:42:09.908 --> 00:42:11.875
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

494
00:42:21.508 --> 00:42:23.675
This is all just too much.

495
00:42:30.808 --> 00:42:33.207
[Olga sighs]

496
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.541
How did you find
out about the box?

497
00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:43.775
How did you find out
about any of this?

498
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.541
Many years ago,

499
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:52.408
I discovered the diary
of the box's creator.

500
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:56.641
He dedicated his life
to the study of demons.

501
00:42:57.574 --> 00:43:00.940
The box was created to contain

502
00:43:00.974 --> 00:43:04.307
the most powerful demon
he ever encountered.

503
00:43:05.908 --> 00:43:07.307
The Jackestemara.

504
00:43:08.241 --> 00:43:09.474
Jackestemara?

505
00:43:11.508 --> 00:43:13.274
"The Demon of Torment".

506
00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:20.108
If the box was
built to contain it,

507
00:43:21.907 --> 00:43:22.974
why can it be opened?

508
00:43:24.241 --> 00:43:26.641
Because it was never
meant to stay locked.

509
00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:31.241
Many have opened it,

510
00:43:31.274 --> 00:43:35.541
but I believe we are
the only ones alive

511
00:43:35.574 --> 00:43:38.408
who know the box's true purpose.

512
00:43:40.274 --> 00:43:41.641
To make a single wish.

513
00:43:42.775 --> 00:43:46.307
A wish granted for
unleashing the demon.

514
00:43:50.207 --> 00:43:52.775
A wish granted by the demon?

515
00:43:52.808 --> 00:43:53.641
[Olga] Yes.

516
00:43:55.142 --> 00:43:59.741
A reward for allowing it
access to our world once again

517
00:44:00.775 --> 00:44:02.541
to find six victims.

518
00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:06.940
You asked for life.

519
00:44:11.207 --> 00:44:13.274
Why does the demon need to kill?

520
00:44:14.974 --> 00:44:17.608
It takes its victim's life.

521
00:44:18.508 --> 00:44:21.574
Their strength, their soul.

522
00:44:21.608 --> 00:44:23.907
Everything is
transferred to the demon.

523
00:44:25.307 --> 00:44:29.608
But most of all, killing
keeps its hold over Didier.

524
00:44:31.241 --> 00:44:32.508
Didier Dubois.

525
00:44:33.675 --> 00:44:35.008
Its human host.

526
00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:40.374
The creature was once human?

527
00:44:43.008 --> 00:44:45.708
Dubois was a clown
in the Victorian era.

528
00:44:47.441 --> 00:44:48.675
For as long as he
could remember,

529
00:44:48.708 --> 00:44:50.840
he was plagued with
voices in his head.

530
00:44:51.974 --> 00:44:54.741
They demanded he
kill his own family.

531
00:44:55.907 --> 00:44:58.142
They grew louder by the day.

532
00:45:00.807 --> 00:45:02.174
You see, the Jackestemara

533
00:45:02.207 --> 00:45:04.641
initially takes
control of the mind.

534
00:45:07.675 --> 00:45:10.775
But it grows inside its
human host like a cancer.

535
00:45:13.241 --> 00:45:16.708
Eventually, taking over
the body completely.

536
00:45:20.907 --> 00:45:24.108
Dubois sought to
exorcize the demon.

537
00:45:30.608 --> 00:45:32.274
But it was too late.

538
00:45:33.508 --> 00:45:37.108
[sinister orchestral music]

539
00:45:37.142 --> 00:45:39.708
It had already taken
too strong of a hold.

540
00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:04.174
Dubois knew he was
running out of time.

541
00:46:04.207 --> 00:46:07.975
The demon would soon use him
to unleash unthinkable cruelty.

542
00:46:10.207 --> 00:46:11.740
To save his family's life

543
00:46:11.774 --> 00:46:15.740
and any others who
crossed his path,

544
00:46:15.774 --> 00:46:19.108
Dubois demanded he
be cast into the box.

545
00:46:21.042 --> 00:46:21.874

A bit weird. [chuckles]

624

Has he ever had a girlfriend?

I've seen him with plenty
women over the years, but,

626

something's always
got in the way.

627

"someone".

629
00:54:54.508 --> 00:54:57.941
He gets infatuated, but
then she gets in his ear.

I think Mrs. Marsdale is
scared she'll be replaced.

You should see him with
a drink in him, though.

All right. [sighs]

642
00:55:43.341 --> 00:55:45.875
A few years ago, he
got absolutely hammered

643
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:48.273
and he started talking
to me out of the blue

644
00:55:48.306 --> 00:55:49.841
about his time
back in America.

645
00:55:51.474 --> 00:55:52.675
You could see he
was out of control,

646
00:55:52.708 --> 00:55:54.374
but I just couldn't
stop him talking.

647
00:55:55.775 --> 00:55:59.108
It's like he needed to
tell his story to someone.

648
00:56:00.975 --> 00:56:03.841
Edgar's father also
had a drinking problem,

649
00:56:03.875 --> 00:56:06.075
and was often violent
towards Mrs. Marsdale.

650
00:56:08.273 --> 00:56:10.474
Edgar said one day
he just snapped.

651
00:56:10.508 --> 00:56:11.775
He couldn't stand
back and watch his mom

652
00:56:11.808 --> 00:56:13.173

653
00:56:14.841 --> 00:56:15.675
So...

654
00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.574
Took his father's gin bottle

655
00:56:20.775 --> 00:56:22.240
and smashed it over his head.

656
00:56:25.008 --> 00:56:25.841
He killed him.

657
00:56:28.341 --> 00:56:30.042
He was only 12 years old.

658
00:56:31.374 --> 00:56:34.808
Mrs. Marsdale
framed Edgar's uncle

659
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:36.273
and the two fled the country.

660
00:56:37.775 --> 00:56:39.875
I've always got the
impression she will never

661
00:56:39.908 --> 00:56:41.708
let him forget what
she did for him.

662
00:56:43.474 --> 00:56:44.908
You can see it in his eyes.

663
00:56:44.941 --> 00:56:48.173
The look of determination
to make her happy.

664
00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:54.875
He would die for that woman.

665
00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:59.206
That's why you should
never be afraid of him.

666

worm wants you to believe,

667

that I wouldn't tell a soul.

01:04:09.008 --> 01:04:10.674
Just say what's on your mind.

730
01:04:16.274 --> 01:04:17.474
You don't wanna tell me?

731
01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:23.807
I'm afraid you'll
think I'm crazy.

732
01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:31.941
Try me.

733
01:04:37.808 --> 01:04:40.174
Last night, I...

734
01:04:43.474 --> 01:04:44.541
I saw...

735
01:04:46.274 --> 01:04:47.142
You saw what?

736
01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.408
I've never seen
anything like it before.

737
01:04:57.941 --> 01:05:01.441
But whatever it was,
it wasn't human.

738
01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:05.674
It was...

739
01:05:05.707 --> 01:05:07.508
It was some sort of creature.

740
01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.474
I'm not making this up.

741
01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:22.341
You don't believe me.

742
01:05:24.808 --> 01:05:25.808
Well...

743
01:05:25.841 --> 01:05:27.341
[Amy] Well what?

744
01:05:27.374 --> 01:05:30.108
It's not logical, Amy.

745
01:05:30.142 --> 01:05:31.640
But I know what I saw!

746
01:05:36.042 --> 01:05:40.207
- Are you sure?
- [somber orchestral music]

747
01:05:42.474 --> 01:05:43.307
I...

748
01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:45.941
Look.

749
01:05:47.274 --> 01:05:48.274
Take the day off.

750
01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:51.341
Take the rest of the week off.

751
01:05:52.341 --> 01:05:53.573
Janet and I will cope.

752
01:05:54.707 --> 01:05:56.374
I'm sure the rest
will do you some good.

753
01:05:57.775 --> 01:06:01.573
Now, Dr. Clarke is on
his way. He's a good man.

754
01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:04.241
He's been a blessing for Mother
and I, these last few years.

755
01:06:05.674 --> 01:06:08.441
Do as he says and I promise
you, you'll be right as rain.

756
01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:18.808
In the meantime, if
you need anything,

757
01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:21.042
anything at all,

758
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.674
just shout.

759
01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:38.042
You're in good hands
with us down here, Amy.

760
01:06:41.241 --> 01:06:42.808
There's no safer place to be.

[Clarke] Okay.

764
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.274
Are you taking any medication?

765
01:07:19.307 --> 01:07:20.142
No.

766
01:07:21.307 --> 01:07:24.540
Difficult question. No
judgment, of course.

767
01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:26.841
Have you taken anything
you shouldn't have

768
01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:28.341
in the past 24 hours?

769
01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.207
Recreational drugs are
one of the most common

770
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.241
causes of hallucinations.

771
01:07:32.274 --> 01:07:34.241
It wasn't a hallucination.

[Clarke clears his throat]

773
01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:45.507
I'm going to give you...

[dark orchestral music]

775
01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:58.042
I'm going to suggest
you get plenty of rest.

776
01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.440
I'll leave you my card.

777
01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:04.008
My direct number
is at the bottom.

778
01:08:05.174 --> 01:08:06.841
Please feel free
to give me a call

779
01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.142
if you have any further
problems or concerns.

780

what the problem is.

[footsteps recede]

You didn't do it, did you?

785
01:08:55.507 --> 01:08:56.775
Why are you doing this?

786
01:08:58.373 --> 01:08:59.407
This is just wrong.

787
01:09:00.708 --> 01:09:03.207
- Why are you lying to her?
- Keep it down.

788
01:09:06.407 --> 01:09:07.975
I'm gonna tell Amy the truth.

Ruin what?

792
01:09:17.008 --> 01:09:18.975
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't go up there

793
01:09:19.008 --> 01:09:20.274
and tell her the truth.

794
01:09:23.008 --> 01:09:24.775
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

01:09:26.042 --> 01:09:27.775
[Clarke scoffs]

796
01:09:27.808 --> 01:09:29.808
You think I'm afraid of you?

797
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:33.675
No.

798
01:09:35.274 --> 01:09:36.075
Not of me.

[suspenseful orchestral music]

800
01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.241
But you should be afraid.

801

Is that right?

802
01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:47.741
Afraid of what?

[Edgar chuckles]

We need to finish this
and get away, quickly.

No.

Well, I think he
was going to, but,

844
01:13:21.808 --> 01:13:23.641
for some reason, he
changed his mind.

845
01:13:25.307 --> 01:13:26.508
I overheard something earlier

846
01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:28.274
that I definitely
wasn't supposed to.

I couldn't catch what they
were saying exactly, but...

848

I saw Edgar give
the doctor money.

849
01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.206
He gave him a lot of money.

850
01:13:43.274 --> 01:13:46.641
It looked like he was being
paid to give you something.

851

Give me what?

01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:00.173
You think Edgar paid
him to give me pills?

853
01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:01.775
The doctor seemed against
what they were scheming with

854
01:14:01.808 --> 01:14:05.241
to begin with, but the cash,
well, that changed everything.

Oh, my god.

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.173

It's gone!

Edgar's taken it!

864
01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.307
Well, why would he
take that from us?

865
01:14:23.341 --> 01:14:25.408
I told him I wanna go home
and he wouldn't let me,

866
01:14:25.441 --> 01:14:28.307
so he's got the gate key and
he's locked it, hasn't he?
