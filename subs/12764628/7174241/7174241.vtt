2
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.374
I trust the
money is on its way.

3
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:28.307
Mm.

4
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.441
Here it is.

5
00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:48.540
The oldest Jack in the box...

6
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.708
ever discovered.

7
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.341
The original

8
00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:56.573
Jack in the box.

9
00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:03.374
I believe this is the very
one you've been looking for.

10
00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:05.808
Yes.

11
00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:09.507
This is the one.

12
00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.142
Finding it wasn't easy.

13
00:01:19.908 --> 00:01:22.875
This box was linked to a
murder case a few years back.

14
00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:27.540
Some nut in Hawthorne drove
its value on the black market

15
00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:31.174
through the roof with
his... ghost stories.

16
00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:36.741
Some sick-minded collectors
would bleed themselves dry

17
00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:39.207
to get their hands
on a thing like this.

18
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:43.507
Thankfully, none of
them have pockets

19
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.641
quite as deep as yours.

20
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:54.540
This will be a
wonderful addition

21
00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:56.075
to our vintage
toy collection.

22
00:01:58.108 --> 00:01:59.941
It will take pride of place.

23
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:12.608
Mr. Huxley, can I ask you
not to smoke that in here?

24
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:15.108
You can ask all you like,

25
00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:17.207
but I don't take
orders from the help.

26
00:02:18.407 --> 00:02:19.808
Do as he says.

27
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.708
Or that briefcase will
get a whole lot lighter.

28
00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:38.241
I'm no servant.

29
00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:43.075
You sure fooled me.

30
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.108
He'll get what he deserves.

31
00:03:04.207 --> 00:03:05.675
I'll put this on display.

32
00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:06.541
Leave it.

33
00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.340
I wish to be left alone now.

34
00:03:14.675 --> 00:03:17.075
All right. I'll take
it down in the morning.

35
00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:20.174
Can I get you anything?

36
00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:22.574
Goodnight.

37
00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:24.941
Goodnight.

38
00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:30.440
Sleep well, Mother.

39
00:04:26.373 --> 00:04:27.608
Keys.

40
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:29.474
Keys!

41
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.808
It's quite
a sight, isn't it?

42
00:07:58.741 --> 00:07:59.941
It certainly is.

43
00:08:16.541 --> 00:08:19.307
It always takes them a lifetime
to open these old gates.

44
00:08:20.474 --> 00:08:22.341
We'd break into
Fort Knox quicker.

45
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:43.541
Here we go.

46
00:09:27.741 --> 00:09:28.574
Welcome, Amy.

47
00:09:30.775 --> 00:09:31.608
Thank you.

48
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:35.908
You must be Edgar. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

49
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.608
This place is incredible.

50
00:09:39.908 --> 00:09:40.841
It certainly is.

51
00:09:42.108 --> 00:09:44.207
I often forget how lucky we are.

52
00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:46.875
This has been home to
Mother and I for 20 years.

53
00:09:47.974 --> 00:09:49.974
I'm not used to luxuries.

54
00:09:50.908 --> 00:09:53.174
She never spares expense.

55
00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:54.441
Is your mother here?

56
00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:56.274
I'd really like to thank
her for the opportunity.

57
00:10:02.108 --> 00:10:03.775
She won't want to be disturbed.

58
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.675
She's been bed bound
for some time now.

59
00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.307
That's awful.

60
00:10:10.474 --> 00:10:13.541
She has osteosarcoma.
Cancer of the bones.

61
00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:17.374
The agony she feels with
each movement, it's uh...

62
00:10:18.574 --> 00:10:20.075
I wouldn't wish it
on my worst enemy.

63
00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:25.474
She's been seen by every doctor,
every expert we could find.

64
00:10:29.075 --> 00:10:31.608
She was given roughly
six months to live.

65
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:32.874
That was five months ago.

66
00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:41.641
But I'll never give up on her.

67
00:10:41.675 --> 00:10:42.474
She's a fighter.

68
00:10:49.108 --> 00:10:51.508
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

69
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.474
Please, come in.

70
00:10:59.741 --> 00:11:01.241
Your duties here
are all focused on

71
00:11:01.274 --> 00:11:03.675
the general upkeep of the manor.

72
00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:05.675
Mainly cleaning and ironing.

73
00:11:05.708 --> 00:11:06.874
I'll brief you every morning

74
00:11:06.907 --> 00:11:08.741
with the tasks
for the day ahead.

75
00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:10.274
Your room is on the first floor.

76
00:11:10.307 --> 00:11:12.940
The floor is shared with your
colleagues, Janet and Frank.

77
00:11:12.974 --> 00:11:15.541
My mother and I
occupy the top floor.

78
00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:17.307
We don't charge for the room,

79
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:19.641
or even any meals
you're provided with.

80
00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:23.008
You are treated in many
ways as one of the family.

81
00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:28.174
All we ask in return is that
you follow our rules, strictly.

82
00:11:32.008 --> 00:11:32.807
Have a read.

83
00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:38.142
I, uh, I think you'll agree
the role pays quite handsomely.

84
00:11:42.574 --> 00:11:45.075
Quite?

85
00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.641
A nine o'clock curfew?

86
00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:53.142
No one comes in or
out of those gates

87
00:11:53.174 --> 00:11:54.508
from nine PM onwards.

88
00:11:56.008 --> 00:11:57.708
I don't fancy your chances
over those 10-foot walls,

89
00:11:57.741 --> 00:12:00.441
so please, make sure you're
on this side of the gates

90
00:12:00.474 --> 00:12:04.108
at sunset and we
won't have a problem.

91
00:12:11.075 --> 00:12:16.075
Well?

92
00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:30.508
Welcome to Rosewood Manor.

93
00:12:41.142 --> 00:12:42.341
Good morning, Mother.

94
00:12:42.374 --> 00:12:45.142
Oh, my god!

95
00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:52.908
Mr. Huxley is dead.

96
00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:55.740
How?

97
00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:56.774
Who did this?

98
00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:01.174
This box, Edgar.

99
00:13:03.274 --> 00:13:05.374
It's not what you think it is.

100
00:13:06.908 --> 00:13:10.908
It was built to contain
something not of this world.

101
00:13:14.142 --> 00:13:14.975
A demon.

102
00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:19.008
By opening the box,

103
00:13:20.274 --> 00:13:21.374
I have released it.

104
00:13:23.274 --> 00:13:25.142
And if it gets what it wants,

105
00:13:25.174 --> 00:13:28.541
it has the power to
rid me of my illness.

106
00:13:29.408 --> 00:13:31.374
I will be healthy once again.

107
00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:35.042
What does it want?

108
00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:38.807
Six sacrifices.

109
00:13:40.174 --> 00:13:42.008
And I will live.

110
00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:49.075
This is insane. This is insane.

111
00:13:50.374 --> 00:13:53.908
I need your help.

112
00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:54.774
Edgar.

113
00:13:56.008 --> 00:13:58.641
None of the staff are
to leave the grounds.

114
00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:03.508
You must keep them here by
whatever means necessary.

115
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:04.374
To die?

116
00:14:05.608 --> 00:14:08.374
It needs five more victims.

117
00:14:10.807 --> 00:14:12.908
You must bring
more to the manor.

118
00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:16.374
I'm not sure I can do this.

119
00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:20.908
We've done the
impossible before.

120
00:14:23.174 --> 00:14:25.274
You're stronger than you know.

121
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.740
Will you help me, Edgar?

122
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:43.941
Of course I will.

123
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:50.008
You know that.

124
00:15:32.908 --> 00:15:35.174
Is anybody there?

125
00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:43.941
You've gotta help me.

126
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:47.374
Mr. Huxley?

127
00:16:16.274 --> 00:16:18.741
You've gotta
help me outta here!

128
00:16:18.775 --> 00:16:20.875
I'm begging you, have mercy.

129
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.641
Open the box, Edgar.

130
00:17:23.573 --> 00:17:24.775
Why should I help you?

131
00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:29.341
Have mercy. I'm
begging you, have mercy.

132
00:17:31.075 --> 00:17:33.008
Let me out, Edgar! Now!

133
00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:55.975
Let me out!

134
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.108
It won't open!

135
00:18:05.142 --> 00:18:06.408
Let me out!

136
00:18:52.307 --> 00:18:54.641
The person whom
you're trying to reach

137
00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:56.008
is currently unavailable.

138
00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:58.008
Please leave your
message after the...

139
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:06.808
Come on.

140
00:19:18.675 --> 00:19:21.174
That vase was only
worth about a grand.

141
00:19:22.407 --> 00:19:24.608
Don't worry. I'll
tell Edgar I did it.

142
00:19:24.641 --> 00:19:27.142
I've been here way to long
to get kicked out now.

143
00:19:27.174 --> 00:19:28.741
Thanks.

144
00:19:28.775 --> 00:19:32.174
I'm Janet, by the way. I'm
on housekeeping duty, too.

145
00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:34.841
Frank. I'm the chef.

146
00:19:34.875 --> 00:19:37.008
It's great to meet you both.

147
00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.975
So, everything all right so far?

148
00:19:40.241 --> 00:19:43.108
Yeah. So far so good.

149
00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:44.941
Where's the house phone?

150
00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:46.641
I just, I can't get
any signal anywhere

151
00:19:46.675 --> 00:19:48.241
and I could do
with making a call.

152
00:19:49.975 --> 00:19:51.307
What?

153
00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.541
Uh...

154
00:19:52.574 --> 00:19:54.841
Yeah, there's no
house phone here.

155
00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:56.775
And honestly, good
luck getting a signal,

156
00:19:56.808 --> 00:19:59.941
'cause I've tried many times.

157
00:19:59.975 --> 00:20:02.708
I just, I need to
call my boyfriend.

158
00:20:02.741 --> 00:20:05.541
Well, my ex.

159
00:20:05.574 --> 00:20:08.641
Is there a computer here?
I could send an email.

160
00:20:08.675 --> 00:20:09.508
Nope.

161
00:20:12.574 --> 00:20:14.574
There's no internet, either?

162
00:20:14.608 --> 00:20:18.108
Welcome to the 1800s,
lovely.

163
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:22.508
He's out of sight, out of mind.

164
00:20:23.808 --> 00:20:25.373
It's a blessing in disguise.

165
00:20:27.541 --> 00:20:30.174
Trust me.

166
00:20:30.207 --> 00:20:31.042
Check.

167
00:20:35.975 --> 00:20:37.108
Oh, come on.

168
00:20:37.142 --> 00:20:38.941
I've got you cornered.
It's all over.

169
00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:44.541
Can I have a go?

170
00:20:47.941 --> 00:20:48.741
Please do.

171
00:20:49.941 --> 00:20:51.441
I'm not very good
at this chess lark.

172
00:20:52.641 --> 00:20:54.075
Let's see what you
got, city girl.

173
00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:20.975
Oh, you're just gonna
run around the board

174
00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:22.108
all night, aren't you?

175
00:21:24.008 --> 00:21:26.574
I'll be honest, you didn't
strike me as a chess player.

176
00:21:26.608 --> 00:21:27.441
Why?

177
00:21:28.908 --> 00:21:31.108
Well, you don't meet many
attractive chess players.

178
00:21:32.373 --> 00:21:35.741
Thanks.

179
00:21:35.775 --> 00:21:37.574
There wasn't much else
to do but play games,

180
00:21:37.608 --> 00:21:38.975
growing up in an orphanage.

181
00:21:41.374 --> 00:21:43.240
When I started
beating the adults,

182
00:21:43.273 --> 00:21:45.174
out-thinking people
twice my age,

183
00:21:45.206 --> 00:21:47.741
it gave me the belief that
I could plan an escape.

184
00:21:49.206 --> 00:21:50.574
You escaped the orphanage?

185
00:21:52.108 --> 00:21:54.042
But I came straight
back the next day.

186
00:21:55.741 --> 00:21:56.541
Why?

187
00:21:57.741 --> 00:22:00.075
I just needed to prove
to myself that I could.

188
00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:02.340
From that point on, I
was no longer afraid

189
00:22:02.374 --> 00:22:03.374
of where I'd end up.

190
00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:08.206
I took comfort knowing
that if I ended up

191
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.841
in a bad situation with a
family that mistreated me,

192
00:22:13.975 --> 00:22:15.641
I could find my way
out of anywhere.

193
00:22:18.341 --> 00:22:19.173
Checkmate.

194
00:22:26.541 --> 00:22:27.374
Yes!

195
00:22:28.808 --> 00:22:32.008
I think she's gonna fit
in just fine around here.

196
00:22:32.042 --> 00:22:32.841
Don't you?

197
00:22:48.775 --> 00:22:51.741
- Come on!
- Shh, keep your voice down.

198
00:23:07.341 --> 00:23:09.206
I hate those creaky floorboards.

199
00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:16.508
Are you sure they didn't see us?

200
00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:17.741
Yes. I'm sure.

201
00:23:36.808 --> 00:23:37.641
Shh.

202
00:24:00.341 --> 00:24:01.875
You're so paranoid.

203
00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:05.274
You look pretty scared, too.

204
00:24:05.307 --> 00:24:08.107
I don't get scared.

205
00:24:08.141 --> 00:24:09.341
- Liar.
- Mm-hm.

206
00:24:20.908 --> 00:24:21.741
Frank?

207
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:24.574
- What?
- I can't do this.

208
00:24:25.975 --> 00:24:27.574
I'm sorry. My mind, it's racing.

209
00:24:33.173 --> 00:24:34.008
Fine.

210
00:24:35.441 --> 00:24:36.274
I'm sorry.

211
00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:40.241
Yeah.

212
00:24:40.274 --> 00:24:42.775
Yeah.

213
00:25:15.541 --> 00:25:16.474
Very funny, Janet.

214
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:22.574
Open the door.

215
00:25:32.041 --> 00:25:33.908
All right, this isn't funny.

216
00:25:33.941 --> 00:25:36.374
Open the door.

217
00:25:55.307 --> 00:25:56.808
Janet, open the door!

218
00:26:02.775 --> 00:26:05.940
For Christ's sake, you
know I get claustrophobic!

219
00:26:05.974 --> 00:26:07.041
Open the door!

220
00:26:08.174 --> 00:26:09.241
Janet!

221
00:26:50.142 --> 00:26:50.974
Help!

222
00:27:03.641 --> 00:27:05.808
I can't do this.

223
00:27:05.841 --> 00:27:08.940
I can't do this.

224
00:27:08.974 --> 00:27:13.307
I can't do
this, I can't...

225
00:27:27.907 --> 00:27:29.241
I can't do this.

226
00:27:33.108 --> 00:27:34.207
I need to talk to you!

227
00:27:35.675 --> 00:27:37.142
Mother! Let me help you.

228
00:27:37.174 --> 00:27:38.007
No.

229
00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:40.641
I can do it.

230
00:27:42.408 --> 00:27:43.207
Cane.

231
00:27:51.174 --> 00:27:52.474
How can this be?

232
00:27:53.508 --> 00:27:55.541
It has killed again, hasn't it?

233
00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:57.840
Frank is dead.

234
00:28:00.108 --> 00:28:04.840
Every life the demon
takes increases its strength.

235
00:28:05.907 --> 00:28:07.441
And as it gets stronger-

236
00:28:08.675 --> 00:28:09.541
So do you.

237
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.042
I'm another step closer.

238
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:21.675
Have patience.

239
00:28:28.142 --> 00:28:30.408
You won't let me
down, will you, Edgar?

240
00:28:32.574 --> 00:28:33.408
Hm?

241
00:28:35.741 --> 00:28:39.574
The demon must continue
to get what it wants.

242
00:28:42.775 --> 00:28:44.042
We're gonna finish this.

243
00:28:45.641 --> 00:28:46.474
Together.

244
00:28:49.907 --> 00:28:52.108
I won't rest until
it kills four more.

245
00:28:55.408 --> 00:29:00.142
Whatever it takes, Mother,
I'm gonna keep you alive.

246
00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.408
I promise.

247
00:29:42.508 --> 00:29:46.274
You should've told me
that you were coming.

248
00:29:48.608 --> 00:29:49.908
Do you always wear that?

249
00:29:53.474 --> 00:29:54.274
Wear what?

250
00:29:55.641 --> 00:29:56.840
That perfume.

251
00:29:58.042 --> 00:30:00.108
I bought that for you
for special occasions.

252
00:30:02.541 --> 00:30:04.807
Look, Edgar, I'll see
you tomorrow, okay?

253
00:30:05.941 --> 00:30:08.840
I need to talk to you.

254
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:10.975
I have to tell you something.

255
00:30:11.008 --> 00:30:14.307
It's killing me, keeping
it to myself. Please.

256
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:29.740
I think you should
look at trying

257
00:30:29.774 --> 00:30:31.274
to get some professional help.

258
00:30:33.641 --> 00:30:35.374
I've never seen you
like this before.

259
00:30:37.674 --> 00:30:40.341
You used to be so happy
and so full of life.

260
00:30:45.341 --> 00:30:46.674
I want that Edgar back.

261
00:30:48.508 --> 00:30:49.307
My Edgar.

262
00:30:52.474 --> 00:30:53.975
Not the one that she makes you.

263
00:30:56.508 --> 00:30:58.042
What do you mean?

264
00:30:59.174 --> 00:31:01.075
Look, I'm not
trying to upset you.

265
00:31:01.108 --> 00:31:02.574
What do you mean?

266
00:31:14.574 --> 00:31:17.075
I don't like the
way your mother treats you.

267
00:31:18.908 --> 00:31:23.108
You've spent so much time
caring for her recently,

268
00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:25.841
you change.

269
00:31:28.441 --> 00:31:30.808
The more time you spend
around her, you...

270
00:31:32.707 --> 00:31:35.307
You become someone else.

271
00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:37.508
She gave up everything for me.

272
00:31:41.307 --> 00:31:44.274
If she had told the police
the truth about what I did,

273
00:31:47.707 --> 00:31:49.075
my life would be over,

274
00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:52.241
before it even began.

275
00:31:56.307 --> 00:32:00.474
I'm forever in her debt.

276
00:32:05.341 --> 00:32:10.008
Look, I think we could both
do with a nice cup of tea.

277
00:33:15.307 --> 00:33:18.708
Missing
me already, huh?

278
00:33:22.008 --> 00:33:23.474
Hello?

279
00:36:03.108 --> 00:36:03.941
Frank?

280
00:36:23.675 --> 00:36:25.641
You're really late.
It's almost 7:30.

281
00:36:31.008 --> 00:36:32.042
Frank's not here.

282
00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.975
He left the manor
last night, so,

283
00:36:39.941 --> 00:36:42.108
I will prepare Mother's
breakfast myself.

284
00:38:29.775 --> 00:38:31.374
Your face.

285
00:38:31.408 --> 00:38:33.075
That wasn't funny!

286
00:38:33.108 --> 00:38:36.474
I'm just keeping you on
your toes.

287
00:38:39.441 --> 00:38:41.808
What the hell is that thing?

288
00:38:41.841 --> 00:38:44.808
Some sort of antique
Jack in a box, I guess.

289
00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:47.206
It's a new one.

290
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.941
Olga's always had a taste
for weird collectible stuff.

291
00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.042
Not much of a looker,
though, is he?

292
00:38:54.408 --> 00:38:55.675
Look at those eyes!

293
00:39:00.206 --> 00:39:02.374
I'm sorry, okay?

294
00:39:02.408 --> 00:39:05.075
I wouldn't have done it if I
knew it'd bother you this much.

295
00:39:08.008 --> 00:39:11.142
I assume Edgar told
you about Frank?

296
00:39:15.908 --> 00:39:16.741
Yeah.

297
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.408
Yeah, I woke up to a note
outside my door.

298
00:39:22.441 --> 00:39:24.141
He said he was
missing home, so...

299
00:39:25.508 --> 00:39:27.374
Had he talked about
leaving before?

300
00:39:33.273 --> 00:39:34.975
We talked about
leaving every day.

301
00:39:37.008 --> 00:39:38.675
But we were gonna
do it together.

302
00:39:40.206 --> 00:39:41.608
We were gonna start a business

303
00:39:41.641 --> 00:39:45.108
and secretly I hoped
we'd start a family, too.

304
00:39:49.374 --> 00:39:50.474
I just don't get it.

305
00:39:51.975 --> 00:39:53.875
Frank hated going home.

306
00:39:57.173 --> 00:39:59.408
I clearly didn't know
him as well as I thought.

307
00:40:02.107 --> 00:40:04.441
He didn't care about me
as much as I thought.

308
00:40:07.574 --> 00:40:09.173
I'm sorry, Janet.

309
00:40:11.508 --> 00:40:13.975
Like I said.

310
00:40:14.008 --> 00:40:16.240
Out of sight.

311
00:40:16.274 --> 00:40:17.274
Out of mind.

312
00:40:44.808 --> 00:40:47.474
You are consumed by
guilt, aren't you?

313
00:40:49.274 --> 00:40:51.908
We are on the cusp
of a miracle, yet,

314
00:40:51.941 --> 00:40:53.808
you feel guilt over them.

315
00:40:54.841 --> 00:40:57.408
A salesman and a cook.

316
00:40:57.441 --> 00:41:01.474
They are people. Flesh
and blood, like you and I.

317
00:41:01.508 --> 00:41:03.241
They are nothing like us.

318
00:41:06.206 --> 00:41:08.374
What happens when people
go looking for them?

319
00:41:09.541 --> 00:41:11.741
What happens when
they come here?

320
00:41:11.775 --> 00:41:15.408
When all this is over,
we will start again.

321
00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:21.008
Somewhere so far from here,
no one will ever find us.

322
00:41:23.107 --> 00:41:25.207
We've done it before,
we will do it again.

323
00:41:32.574 --> 00:41:33.941
But that's not all, is it?

324
00:41:35.374 --> 00:41:37.307
- I'm fine.
- Don't lie to me, boy!

325
00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:51.141
It's that girl you've
been seeing, isn't it? Hm?

326
00:41:52.708 --> 00:41:53.508
Stacey.

327
00:41:56.374 --> 00:41:57.941
I don't want
to talk about it.

328
00:41:57.975 --> 00:41:59.441
Oh.

329
00:41:59.474 --> 00:42:01.875
Whatever she's done, she's
not good enough for you.

330
00:42:01.908 --> 00:42:04.041
- None of them are.
- That's enough, Mother!

331
00:42:08.374 --> 00:42:09.875
I'm sorry.

332
00:42:09.908 --> 00:42:11.875
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

333
00:42:21.508 --> 00:42:23.675
This is all just too much.

334
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:38.541
How did you find
out about the box?

335
00:42:41.641 --> 00:42:43.775
How did you find out
about any of this?

336
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.541
Many years ago,

337
00:42:49.775 --> 00:42:52.408
I discovered the diary
of the box's creator.

338
00:42:53.841 --> 00:42:56.641
He dedicated his life
to the study of demons.

339
00:42:57.574 --> 00:43:00.940
The box was created to contain

340
00:43:00.974 --> 00:43:04.307
the most powerful demon
he ever encountered.

341
00:43:05.908 --> 00:43:07.307
The Jackestemara.

342
00:43:08.241 --> 00:43:09.474
Jackestemara?

343
00:43:11.508 --> 00:43:13.274
"The Demon of Torment".

344
00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:20.108
If the box was
built to contain it,

345
00:43:21.907 --> 00:43:22.974
why can it be opened?

346
00:43:24.241 --> 00:43:26.641
Because it was never
meant to stay locked.

347
00:43:29.174 --> 00:43:31.241
Many have opened it,

348
00:43:31.274 --> 00:43:35.541
but I believe we are
the only ones alive

349
00:43:35.574 --> 00:43:38.408
who know the box's true purpose.

350
00:43:40.274 --> 00:43:41.641
To make a single wish.

351
00:43:42.775 --> 00:43:46.307
A wish granted for
unleashing the demon.

352
00:43:50.207 --> 00:43:52.775
A wish granted by the demon?

353
00:43:52.808 --> 00:43:53.641
Yes.

354
00:43:55.142 --> 00:43:59.741
A reward for allowing it
access to our world once again

355
00:44:00.775 --> 00:44:02.541
to find six victims.

356
00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:06.940
You asked for life.

357
00:44:11.207 --> 00:44:13.274
Why does the demon need to kill?

358
00:44:14.974 --> 00:44:17.608
It takes its victim's life.

359
00:44:18.508 --> 00:44:21.574
Their strength, their soul.

360
00:44:21.608 --> 00:44:23.907
Everything is
transferred to the demon.

361
00:44:25.307 --> 00:44:29.608
But most of all, killing
keeps its hold over Didier.

362
00:44:31.241 --> 00:44:32.508
Didier Dubois.

363
00:44:33.675 --> 00:44:35.008
Its human host.

364
00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:40.374
The creature was once human?

365
00:44:43.008 --> 00:44:45.708
Dubois was a clown
in the Victorian era.

366
00:44:47.441 --> 00:44:48.675
For as long as he
could remember,

367
00:44:48.708 --> 00:44:50.840
he was plagued with
voices in his head.

368
00:44:51.974 --> 00:44:54.741
They demanded he
kill his own family.

369
00:44:55.907 --> 00:44:58.142
They grew louder by the day.

370
00:45:00.807 --> 00:45:02.174
You see, the Jackestemara

371
00:45:02.207 --> 00:45:04.641
initially takes
control of the mind.

372
00:45:07.675 --> 00:45:10.775
But it grows inside its
human host like a cancer.

373
00:45:13.241 --> 00:45:16.708
Eventually, taking over
the body completely.

374
00:45:20.907 --> 00:45:24.108
Dubois sought to
exorcize the demon.

375
00:45:30.608 --> 00:45:32.274
But it was too late.

376
00:45:37.142 --> 00:45:39.708
It had already taken
too strong of a hold.

377
00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:04.174
Dubois knew he was
running out of time.

378
00:46:04.207 --> 00:46:07.975
The demon would soon use him
to unleash unthinkable cruelty.

379
00:46:10.207 --> 00:46:11.740
To save his family's life

380
00:46:11.774 --> 00:46:15.740
and any others who
crossed his path,

381
00:46:15.774 --> 00:46:19.108
Dubois demanded he
be cast into the box.

382
00:46:21.042 --> 00:46:21.874
Forever.

383
00:46:28.307 --> 00:46:29.641
Dubois was betrayed?

384
00:46:32.374 --> 00:46:34.574
The creator wanted a child.

385
00:46:35.574 --> 00:46:37.975
A son God wouldn't give him.

386
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.807
Once enough time had
passed for the Jack

387
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.307
to take full
control of Dubois...

388
00:46:47.075 --> 00:46:48.675
The deal was made.

389
00:46:53.307 --> 00:46:56.508
The Jack was unleashed.

390
00:46:56.541 --> 00:46:58.675
It claimed its victims.

391
00:47:03.441 --> 00:47:06.508
The first deal with
the demon was complete.

392
00:47:08.941 --> 00:47:11.108
The creator was rewarded...

393
00:47:13.075 --> 00:47:13.908
with a son.

394
00:47:45.108 --> 00:47:47.541
This was never
going to be easy, Edgar.

395
00:47:50.008 --> 00:47:51.441
But a great reward

396
00:47:52.441 --> 00:47:54.808
requires great sacrifice.

397
00:49:12.008 --> 00:49:12.841
Edgar?

398
00:49:14.474 --> 00:49:15.573
Are you here?

399
00:49:16.941 --> 00:49:17.775
It's me.

400
00:49:45.408 --> 00:49:46.241
Edgar?

401
00:50:48.775 --> 00:50:51.142
You were not alone last night.

402
00:50:56.008 --> 00:50:58.108
You're not as careful
as you think you are.

403
00:51:09.507 --> 00:51:14.507
Even at my lowest, when I
told you my mother was dying,

404
00:51:18.174 --> 00:51:20.008
you couldn't disguise
your happiness.

405
00:51:22.207 --> 00:51:26.207
You were counting
down her final days.

406
00:51:27.473 --> 00:51:32.407
Weren't you?

407
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:37.440
Weren't you?

408
00:51:38.741 --> 00:51:40.108
I thought you were the one.

409
00:51:43.042 --> 00:51:47.374
The one that I would one
day share everything with.

410
00:51:54.941 --> 00:51:57.908
But in the end, I
want to thank you.

411
00:51:59.374 --> 00:52:00.841
For making me realize

412
00:52:03.407 --> 00:52:05.608
that she is

413
00:52:05.641 --> 00:52:08.241
all I truly need.

414
00:52:13.274 --> 00:52:16.841
And now Mother will
always be there for me.

415
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.274
No matter what.

416
00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:25.975
Goodbye, Stacey.

417
00:54:07.875 --> 00:54:08.708
Help!

418
00:54:16.508 --> 00:54:17.340
Help!

419
00:54:23.841 --> 00:54:25.008
Somebody help!

420
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:39.306
Edgar's always
been a bit unusual.

421
00:54:40.708 --> 00:54:42.508
A bit weird.

422
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:44.273
Has he ever had a girlfriend?

423
00:54:44.306 --> 00:54:47.340
I've seen him with plenty
women over the years, but,

424
00:54:47.373 --> 00:54:49.142
something's always
got in the way.

425
00:54:50.008 --> 00:54:50.908
Or should I say

426
00:54:51.975 --> 00:54:53.075
"someone".

427
00:54:54.508 --> 00:54:57.941
He gets infatuated, but
then she gets in his ear.

428
00:54:59.373 --> 00:55:01.941
I think Mrs. Marsdale is
scared she'll be replaced.

429
00:55:03.608 --> 00:55:05.975
You should see him with
a drink in him, though.

430
00:55:06.875 --> 00:55:08.408
He really livens up.

431
00:55:08.441 --> 00:55:09.941
Really?

432
00:55:09.975 --> 00:55:12.574
He becomes an open book.

433
00:55:12.608 --> 00:55:13.808
One night, he even to...

434
00:55:16.675 --> 00:55:17.508
No.

435
00:55:18.374 --> 00:55:19.508
No, I can't.

436
00:55:19.541 --> 00:55:20.508
Oh, go on!

437
00:55:40.975 --> 00:55:43.306
All right.

438
00:55:43.341 --> 00:55:45.875
A few years ago, he
got absolutely hammered

439
00:55:46.741 --> 00:55:48.273
and he started talking
to me out of the blue

440
00:55:48.306 --> 00:55:49.841
about his time
back in America.

441
00:55:51.474 --> 00:55:52.675
You could see he
was out of control,

442
00:55:52.708 --> 00:55:54.374
but I just couldn't
stop him talking.

443
00:55:55.775 --> 00:55:59.108
It's like he needed to
tell his story to someone.

444
00:56:00.975 --> 00:56:03.841
Edgar's father also
had a drinking problem,

445
00:56:03.875 --> 00:56:06.075
and was often violent
towards Mrs. Marsdale.

446
00:56:08.273 --> 00:56:10.474
Edgar said one day
he just snapped.

447
00:56:10.508 --> 00:56:11.775
He couldn't stand
back and watch his mom

448
00:56:11.808 --> 00:56:13.173
being beaten up any longer.

449
00:56:14.841 --> 00:56:15.675
So...

450
00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.574
Took his father's gin bottle

451
00:56:20.775 --> 00:56:22.240
and smashed it over his head.

452
00:56:25.008 --> 00:56:25.841
He killed him.

453
00:56:28.341 --> 00:56:30.042
He was only 12 years old.

454
00:56:31.374 --> 00:56:34.808
Mrs. Marsdale
framed Edgar's uncle

455
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:36.273
and the two fled the country.

456
00:56:37.775 --> 00:56:39.875
I've always got the
impression she will never

457
00:56:39.908 --> 00:56:41.708
let him forget what
she did for him.

458
00:56:43.474 --> 00:56:44.908
You can see it in his eyes.

459
00:56:44.941 --> 00:56:48.173
The look of determination
to make her happy.

460
00:56:51.675 --> 00:56:54.875
He would die for that woman.

461
00:56:56.741 --> 00:56:59.206
That's why you should
never be afraid of him.

462
00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.775
Because despite what that
worm wants you to believe,

463
00:57:03.808 --> 00:57:05.574
he has no power around here.

464
00:57:06.808 --> 00:57:11.307
None whatsoever.

465
00:57:11.341 --> 00:57:14.042
Only Mother...

466
00:57:15.708 --> 00:57:16.908
Drops the ax.

467
00:57:18.274 --> 00:57:19.875
But this stays between us, okay?

468
00:57:21.274 --> 00:57:23.341
I promised him the next morning
that I wouldn't tell a soul.

469
00:57:25.374 --> 00:57:28.908
He literally begged me.

470
00:57:28.941 --> 00:57:30.408
- He begged?
- Yeah.

471
00:57:30.441 --> 00:57:35.408
He was on his hands and knees,
right where you're sitting.

472
00:59:09.875 --> 00:59:11.142
Help!

473
01:02:41.408 --> 01:02:42.907
Somebody help! Help!

474
01:02:42.941 --> 01:02:44.241
Amy?

475
01:02:47.641 --> 01:02:50.541
Amy? Amy!

476
01:02:50.574 --> 01:02:53.740
Amy, what's
happened? Talk to me!

477
01:02:57.508 --> 01:02:58.241
It's okay.

478
01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:21.075
How are you feeling?

479
01:03:24.042 --> 01:03:25.341
I thought this would help.

480
01:03:46.307 --> 01:03:47.641
I want to go home, Edgar.

481
01:03:50.908 --> 01:03:52.674
I want to leave today.

482
01:03:58.574 --> 01:04:00.474
What happened last night?

483
01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.674
I don't know how to, uh...

484
01:04:09.008 --> 01:04:10.674
Just say what's on your mind.

485
01:04:16.274 --> 01:04:17.474
You don't wanna tell me?

486
01:04:22.008 --> 01:04:23.807
I'm afraid you'll
think I'm crazy.

487
01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:31.941
Try me.

488
01:04:37.808 --> 01:04:40.174
Last night, I...

489
01:04:43.474 --> 01:04:44.541
I saw...

490
01:04:46.274 --> 01:04:47.142
You saw what?

491
01:04:53.307 --> 01:04:55.408
I've never seen
anything like it before.

492
01:04:57.941 --> 01:05:01.441
But whatever it was,
it wasn't human.

493
01:05:04.174 --> 01:05:05.674
It was...

494
01:05:05.707 --> 01:05:07.508
It was some sort of creature.

495
01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.474
I'm not making this up.

496
01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:22.341
You don't believe me.

497
01:05:24.808 --> 01:05:25.808
Well...

498
01:05:25.841 --> 01:05:27.341
Well what?

499
01:05:27.374 --> 01:05:30.108
It's not logical, Amy.

500
01:05:30.142 --> 01:05:31.640
But I know what I saw!

501
01:05:36.042 --> 01:05:40.207
Are you sure?

502
01:05:42.474 --> 01:05:43.307
I...

503
01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:45.941
Look.

504
01:05:47.274 --> 01:05:48.274
Take the day off.

505
01:05:49.841 --> 01:05:51.341
Take the rest of the week off.

506
01:05:52.341 --> 01:05:53.573
Janet and I will cope.

507
01:05:54.707 --> 01:05:56.374
I'm sure the rest
will do you some good.

508
01:05:57.775 --> 01:06:01.573
Now, Dr. Clarke is on
his way. He's a good man.

509
01:06:01.607 --> 01:06:04.241
He's been a blessing for Mother
and I, these last few years.

510
01:06:05.674 --> 01:06:08.441
Do as he says and I promise
you, you'll be right as rain.

511
01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:18.808
In the meantime, if
you need anything,

512
01:06:20.108 --> 01:06:21.042
anything at all,

513
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.674
just shout.

514
01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:38.042
You're in good hands
with us down here, Amy.

515
01:06:41.241 --> 01:06:42.808
There's no safer place to be.

516
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:14.675
Okay.

517
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.274
Are you taking any medication?

518
01:07:19.307 --> 01:07:20.142
No.

519
01:07:21.307 --> 01:07:24.540
Difficult question. No
judgment, of course.

520
01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:26.841
Have you taken anything
you shouldn't have

521
01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:28.341
in the past 24 hours?

522
01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.207
Recreational drugs are
one of the most common

523
01:07:31.241 --> 01:07:32.241
causes of hallucinations.

524
01:07:32.274 --> 01:07:34.241
It wasn't a hallucination.

525
01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:45.507
I'm going to give you...

526
01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:58.042
I'm going to suggest
you get plenty of rest.

527
01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.440
I'll leave you my card.

528
01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:04.008
My direct number
is at the bottom.

529
01:08:05.174 --> 01:08:06.841
Please feel free
to give me a call

530
01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.142
if you have any further
problems or concerns.

531
01:08:10.341 --> 01:08:12.841
No matter what time or
what the problem is.

532
01:08:26.574 --> 01:08:27.841
Look after yourself, Amy.

533
01:08:43.741 --> 01:08:46.075
You didn't do it, did you?

534
01:08:55.507 --> 01:08:56.775
Why are you doing this?

535
01:08:58.373 --> 01:08:59.407
This is just wrong.

536
01:09:00.708 --> 01:09:03.207
- Why are you lying to her?
- Keep it down.

537
01:09:06.407 --> 01:09:07.975
I'm gonna tell Amy the truth.

538
01:09:11.574 --> 01:09:13.341
I'm not gonna let you ruin this.

539
01:09:13.373 --> 01:09:14.440
Ruin what?

540
01:09:17.008 --> 01:09:18.975
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't go up there

541
01:09:19.008 --> 01:09:20.274
and tell her the truth.

542
01:09:23.008 --> 01:09:24.775
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

543
01:09:27.808 --> 01:09:29.808
You think I'm afraid of you?

544
01:09:32.841 --> 01:09:33.675
No.

545
01:09:35.274 --> 01:09:36.075
Not of me.

546
01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.241
But you should be afraid.

547
01:09:42.908 --> 01:09:43.908
Is that right?

548
01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:47.741
Afraid of what?

549
01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:56.207
You have no idea.

550
01:10:06.808 --> 01:10:09.306
Don't ever contact me again.

551
01:10:38.641 --> 01:10:39.675
Open the gate!

552
01:10:43.975 --> 01:10:46.174
Edgar, open the damn gates!

553
01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:06.174
You think you can
keep me here, too?

554
01:11:24.273 --> 01:11:25.741
Edgar!

555
01:11:25.775 --> 01:11:26.708
Let me out!

556
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:29.042
Edgar! Let me out!

557
01:12:33.008 --> 01:12:34.574
I got rid of his car.

558
01:12:36.441 --> 01:12:38.141
He would've told someone.

559
01:12:41.374 --> 01:12:42.941
Somebody knows he was here.

560
01:12:44.141 --> 01:12:46.306
We need to finish this
and get away, quickly.

561
01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.675
I've locked down the manor.

562
01:12:50.641 --> 01:12:51.474
This ends.

563
01:12:53.173 --> 01:12:53.975
Tonight.

564
01:13:07.808 --> 01:13:08.641
What's wrong?

565
01:13:11.675 --> 01:13:13.541
The doctor gave you
meds, didn't he?

566
01:13:15.008 --> 01:13:15.841
No.

567
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.775
Well, I think he
was going to, but,

568
01:13:21.808 --> 01:13:23.641
for some reason, he
changed his mind.

569
01:13:25.307 --> 01:13:26.508
I overheard something earlier

570
01:13:26.541 --> 01:13:28.274
that I definitely
wasn't supposed to.

571
01:13:29.775 --> 01:13:32.408
I couldn't catch what they
were saying exactly, but...

572
01:13:34.741 --> 01:13:36.474
I saw Edgar give
the doctor money.

573
01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.206
He gave him a lot of money.

574
01:13:43.274 --> 01:13:46.641
It looked like he was being
paid to give you something.

575
01:13:46.675 --> 01:13:47.941
Give me what?

576
01:13:58.341 --> 01:14:00.173
You think Edgar paid
him to give me pills?

577
01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:01.775
The doctor seemed against
what they were scheming with

578
01:14:01.808 --> 01:14:05.241
to begin with, but the cash,
well, that changed everything.

579
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.474
Oh, my god.

580
01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.173
Why would he do that?

581
01:14:09.975 --> 01:14:13.074
Something's happening here,
Janet. Something strange.

582
01:14:13.107 --> 01:14:14.775
Look.

583
01:14:14.808 --> 01:14:15.641
It's missing.

584
01:14:16.708 --> 01:14:18.608
- What is?
- The gate key!

585
01:14:18.641 --> 01:14:20.074
It's gone!

586
01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.341
Edgar's taken it!

587
01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.307
Well, why would he
take that from us?

588
01:14:23.341 --> 01:14:25.408
I told him I wanna go home
and he wouldn't let me,

589
01:14:25.441 --> 01:14:28.307
so he's got the gate key and
he's locked it, hasn't he?

590
01:14:29.775 --> 01:14:32.107
Well, give me
another explanation!

591
01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.941
You can't, can you?

592
01:14:46.641 --> 01:14:47.541
My mind's made up.

593
01:14:48.975 --> 01:14:52.274
I'm gonna find that key and
I am getting out of here.

594
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:55.341
Are you coming with me?

595
01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:52.408
Think, Janet, think.

596
01:15:52.441 --> 01:15:54.675
Where would you hide a key?

597
01:19:29.374 --> 01:19:31.108
Edgar, Edgar, please.

598
01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.874
Please help me.

599
01:19:34.908 --> 01:19:37.508
Please, please.

600
01:19:37.541 --> 01:19:38.774
Please help me.

601
01:19:41.941 --> 01:19:43.174
Please help me!

602
01:19:46.008 --> 01:19:46.840
Who's

603
01:19:47.975 --> 01:19:49.474
begging

604
01:19:49.508 --> 01:19:50.774
now?

605
01:19:50.807 --> 01:19:51.641
No, no!

606
01:19:55.574 --> 01:19:56.908
Oh, come on!

607
01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:47.441
Janet?

608
01:21:15.941 --> 01:21:16.774
Janet?

609
01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:32.274
Janet?

610
01:21:47.108 --> 01:21:48.408
Amy?

611
01:22:02.042 --> 01:22:02.875
Amy?

612
01:22:11.008 --> 01:22:12.474
No!

613
01:22:13.341 --> 01:22:14.908
Open the door!

614
01:22:14.941 --> 01:22:16.640
Open the door, now!

615
01:22:18.707 --> 01:22:20.207
Open the door!

616
01:22:21.741 --> 01:22:24.573
Open the door!

617
01:23:03.142 --> 01:23:05.142
There is no use
fighting it, Amy.

618
01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.174
There's nothing you can do.

619
01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:48.708
The demon must be the
one to take your life.

620
01:24:29.775 --> 01:24:30.608
Mother!

621
01:25:01.741 --> 01:25:04.241
No.

622
01:25:05.875 --> 01:25:06.708
No!

623
01:26:15.574 --> 01:26:16.407
Help!

624
01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.407
Come on!

625
01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.641
Come on, please work. Come on.

626
01:26:32.675 --> 01:26:33.508
Come on.

627
01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.641
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

628
01:26:37.675 --> 01:26:38.841
No, Mother! No, please!

629
01:26:38.875 --> 01:26:41.641
Please, please!
Mother, please, no!

630
01:26:43.407 --> 01:26:44.241
No!

631
01:26:49.975 --> 01:26:54.142
Come on!

632
01:26:54.174 --> 01:26:57.174
Oh, come on!

633
01:26:57.207 --> 01:26:59.474
Come on!

634
01:26:59.508 --> 01:27:01.207
Come on!

635
01:28:01.441 --> 01:28:03.108
I'm sorry, Mother.

636
01:28:11.975 --> 01:28:13.042
I failed you.

637
01:28:35.608 --> 01:28:37.741
I just wanted to
see you smile again.

638
01:28:48.975 --> 01:28:51.173
Help!

639
01:29:10.908 --> 01:29:13.142
And you will smile again.

640
01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:16.108
Even if I'm not here to see it.

641
01:29:22.541 --> 01:29:23.608
A life without you

642
01:29:24.908 --> 01:29:26.508
is no life at all.

643
01:29:37.941 --> 01:29:39.273
Consider us even,

644
01:29:41.574 --> 01:29:42.374
Mother.
