00:00:27.603 --> 00:00:30.770
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Heraklion.</i>

2
00:00:30.937 --> 00:00:35.020
<i>The local time is 3 am, and
the temperature is 28 degrees Celsius.</i>

3
00:00:35.228 --> 00:00:37.352
<i>Please remain in your seats</i>

4
00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:39.603
<i>until the aircraft
has come to a complete standstill</i>

5
00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:42.437
<i>and the captain has switched off
the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

6
00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:44.645
<i>Please take care
when opening the overhead bins</i>

7
00:00:44.853 --> 00:00:47.478
<i>as items may have been
dislodged during the flight.</i>

8
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.770
<i>We thank you for flying with us today</i>

9
00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.687
<i>and look forward to
seeing you again soon.</i>

10
00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:55.228
<i>Please check with ground staff
for connecting flights</i>

11
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:57.562
<i>or further travel
to your final destination.</i>

12
00:00:57.728 --> 00:01:00.353
<i>Say uh, ah, Malia!</i>

13
00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:03.437
<i>Say uh, ah, Malia!</i>

14
00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:08.103
I'll tell you why I'm so tired.

15
00:01:08.562 --> 00:01:11.352
- That would be you, Em.
- Why?

16
00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:13.937
What do you mean, "why"? What about
when she was booking the holiday?

17
00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:16.228
You did no work.
All this "I'm exhausted."

18
00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.853
I woke up to 20 messages from you.

19
00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.437
"We have to be there four hours before!"

20
00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:23.103
If it wasn't for me,
would you be here?

21
00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:24.437
Would you be here?

22
00:01:25.478 --> 00:01:28.978
Ah! We're in Malia, babe! Baby!

23
00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:47.062
It's kinda cold.

24
00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:51.352
I'm going in! Come on!

25
00:01:51.353 --> 00:01:53.895
Oh, she's in! She's in! She's in!

26
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.644
Oh!

27
00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:57.227
I don't think we should do this.

28
00:01:57.228 --> 00:01:59.062
I don't think it's supposed
to be this cold.

29
00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:00.853
You'll get used to it.

30
00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:08.311
<i>♪ Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you I should run</i>

31
00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:12.312
<i>♪ I'm saying things I've never said
Doing things I've never done</i>

32
00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:18.852
I fucking love you guys.

33
00:02:18.853 --> 00:02:22.562
- I fucking love you guys!
- Best holiday ever!

34
00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:40.228
Oh, no, look at my fags!

35
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.062
Where?

36
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.353
I'll get them, I'll get them!

37
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.187
No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

38
00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:49.478
I'm so sorry.

39
00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:51.437
It's so cold.

40
00:02:52.145 --> 00:02:53.395
What the fuck?

41
00:03:00.978 --> 00:03:04.062
MUM: GET THERE OK? XX

42
00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:06.477
TARA: X

43
00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:08.145
Ah, fuck's sake!

44
00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:10.312
Set me a fag. Mine are fucked.

45
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:13.228
I swear my mum would've called
on the plane if she could have.

46
00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.728
I'm not sure
Mum's even clocked we've left.

47
00:03:17.687 --> 00:03:19.478
This is all we have
between all of us?

48
00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:22.103
- Yeah, just one.
- This is it to get dry?

49
00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:26.228
- Guys, I'm fucking starving.
- I swear you're always hungry.

50
00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:29.062
Why is the sea so cold?

51
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.103
You know we still got
loads of time to kill?

52
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.228
Do you wanna get chips?

53
00:03:34.728 --> 00:03:36.645
- Yes, 100%.
- Chips! Chips! Chips!

54
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.020
- I want a big fucking big portion.
- Large! Large, large, extra-large.

55
00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:43.353
Oh, excuse me.

56
00:03:43.687 --> 00:03:45.228
Sorry, um...

57
00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:47.937
I was just wondering if maybe
we could have a room with, like, a...

58
00:03:47.938 --> 00:03:49.144
like, a pool view?

59
00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:51.770
Pool view?
No, no, no.

60
00:03:52.312 --> 00:03:54.770
All gone. I'm sorry.

61
00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.645
OK. Um...

62
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.103
I tried.
Apparently, they're all gone.

63
00:04:01.395 --> 00:04:02.853
Hi!

64
00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:05.812
- Hi.
- Um, my name's Tara.

65
00:04:05.937 --> 00:04:08.040
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

66
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:10.145
Um, so, the thing is...
I just spat, sorry.

67
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.270
Um, the thing is,
we're going to need pool view,

68
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.228
because... see our friend Skye there?

69
00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:18.144
She can't swim very well,

70
00:04:18.145 --> 00:04:20.707
so we need to, like,
keep eyes on her at all times.

71
00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.270
- Like, we have to see her.
- We can be lifeguards.

72
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:25.311
We can just dive in
if anything happens.

73
00:04:25.312 --> 00:04:27.352
We're excellent swimmers,
like, really good.

74
00:04:27.353 --> 00:04:29.853
- Save you guys the trouble.
- I actually swim for the county.

75
00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.937
We were hoping
we could use this holiday

76
00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.353
to help teach her...

77
00:04:33.354 --> 00:04:34.769
to doggy-paddle.

78
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.937
- All right, all right.
- Thanks.

79
00:04:45.437 --> 00:04:49.562
Oh, my God! This is insane!

80
00:04:49.687 --> 00:04:51.062
Oh, my God!

81
00:04:51.187 --> 00:04:52.478
Look at this swan!

82
00:04:52.603 --> 00:04:54.937
- I fucking love the curtains.
- He left us swans.

83
00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:57.603
- Taz...
- Oh, babe, stunning!

84
00:04:58.062 --> 00:05:00.520
Outfit number one sorted!
Outfit number...

85
00:05:00.645 --> 00:05:04.937
Oh, there's butterflies
everywhere as well!

86
00:05:04.938 --> 00:05:07.478
Um... Skye! What are you doing?

87
00:05:07.728 --> 00:05:09.228
What are you doing?

88
00:05:09.353 --> 00:05:12.770
- Deep-fried fags.
- You're a nutter!

89
00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:15.353
- But I will have one, thank you. OK.
- They are already dry.

90
00:05:15.478 --> 00:05:17.895
- We got our own fridge!
- Fucking luxury.

91
00:05:18.228 --> 00:05:21.270
This room is huge!
Like, a whole room.

92
00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:22.978
Where? Let's see.

93
00:05:23.645 --> 00:05:26.020
Ey! Pool view!

94
00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.728
Let me see!

95
00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:33.312
Best view I've ever seen in my life!
Whoo!

96
00:05:41.728 --> 00:05:43.478
Ooh! Whoo!

97
00:05:44.062 --> 00:05:46.145
Sorry about that,
but I needed my doughnut.

98
00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:47.645
Breakfast!

99
00:05:48.187 --> 00:05:49.603
Breakfast!

100
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.395
And... breakfast!

101
00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:52.853
Dinner one!

102
00:05:53.812 --> 00:05:55.728
- Shit! Sorry.
- Can you not?

103
00:05:56.395 --> 00:05:59.228
Oi, whoever gets laid the most wins this.

104
00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:01.062
Apple punch for sex?

105
00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:02.853
- No. No, no, no.
- Actually...

106
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.353
This.

107
00:06:06.603 --> 00:06:08.187
Titty glasses.

108
00:06:08.853 --> 00:06:11.228
What do we get if we're sick the most?

109
00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.645
Um, nothing,

110
00:06:12.978 --> 00:06:15.353
because we're not
going to plan for that, you nutter.

111
00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:16.978
All right. All right.

112
00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.707
Bonus prize.

113
00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:20.437
Party girl!

114
00:06:21.853 --> 00:06:24.562
Guys, I've been thinking,

115
00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:27.853
whoever's getting laid the most,
they should kinda get the main room.

116
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.227
Yeah.

117
00:06:29.228 --> 00:06:30.770
And everyone else

118
00:06:31.562 --> 00:06:33.645
just kinda sleep where they land.

119
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.645
Me, I'm going to be refraining
from sleep this holiday.

120
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.145
Don't lie! You're going to be, like,
asleep in the club.

121
00:06:41.437 --> 00:06:43.145
Oi, you look beaut!

122
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.853
Come here, try this.

123
00:06:51.103 --> 00:06:53.437
You should just go out like that.

124
00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:55.687
Like this?

125
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.312
You look banging
no matter what you wear.

126
00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:04.978
Can I borrow some of that lip gloss?

127
00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:06.770
Yeah, let me do it for you.

128
00:07:13.853 --> 00:07:15.312
Look at you.

129
00:07:15.437 --> 00:07:17.978
If you don't get laid on this holiday
then you never will.

130
00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:20.770
No, I can't die a virgin!

131
00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:23.437
HOW TO HAVE SEX

132
00:07:34.812 --> 00:07:36.395
69!

133
00:07:37.228 --> 00:07:38.228
Fuck!

134
00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:44.353
Wait, wait, wait, we're not ready.

135
00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:47.020
Oi! Oi!

136
00:07:48.937 --> 00:07:50.520
Whereabouts you all from?

137
00:07:50.645 --> 00:07:52.312
We don't have any change.

138
00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:55.812
What, am I homeless or something?

139
00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.020

Not like that! Give it here!

151
00:08:38.645 --> 00:08:40.228
Oh, oh.

152
00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:42.853
- I'm too thirsty. Hmm.
- Tara.

153
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.019
I'm going to be sick.

154
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.520
Night one in the Big Brother house,
Em is sick.

155
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.353
Fuck! She's actually going to be sick.

156
00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:55.353
Hold the microphone.

157
00:08:59.937 --> 00:09:03.520
<i>♪ I am the one and only ♪</i>

158
00:09:03.853 --> 00:09:05.437
Can we have three more shots, please?

159
00:09:08.228 --> 00:09:09.665
I love you, Taz.

160
00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:11.103
I love you, too.

161
00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:16.312
Besties for life, yeah?

162
00:09:16.437 --> 00:09:18.937
I've just been to the bar and got shots.

163
00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:20.687
Check it out.

164
00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:22.437
No, no, no.

165
00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:23.687
Yes!

166
00:09:46.687 --> 00:09:49.853
Oi, what happens
if I fail every exam?

167
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.187
Fuck school!
Let's all just find jobs together.

168
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.770
Oi.

169
00:09:54.187 --> 00:09:56.228
You're fucking smart.

170
00:09:57.312 --> 00:09:58.936
I'm actually going to fail.

171
00:09:58.937 --> 00:10:01.478
Taz, even if you failed everything,

172
00:10:01.853 --> 00:10:03.603
you could talk your way in.

173
00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:06.312
- Tara!
- I need a wee.

174
00:10:06.437 --> 00:10:09.437
Chips are technically vegetables,
aren't they?

175
00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:12.603
Skye, is it my night to throw up yet?

176
00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:15.228
You already threw up.

177
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.937
Don't laugh at me!

178
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.061
Tara!

179
00:10:27.062 --> 00:10:29.144
What happens if I go to this good school

180
00:10:29.145 --> 00:10:31.998
and then no one even likes me
when I get there?

181
00:10:31.999 --> 00:10:34.853
Oh, Em, that's silly.
Don't think like that.

182
00:10:34.978 --> 00:10:36.228
No one likes you anyway.

183
00:10:36.353 --> 00:10:38.478
Why do you think
we ended up with you?

184
00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:44.270
- I'm joking.
- Here come on babe! Babe, babe! Babe!

185
00:10:44.395 --> 00:10:46.311
It's, like, a win-win situation.

186
00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:49.228
Either you fail
and you stay with us wasters,

187
00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:51.186
- or...
- I don't wanna fail!

188
00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:52.999
Or you get in and then you're really rich

189
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.812
and you can bring us
on holiday every year.

190
00:10:54.937 --> 00:10:56.102
Vets aren't rich.

191
00:10:56.103 --> 00:10:58.103
They don't have loads
and loads of money.

192
00:10:58.353 --> 00:11:02.062
Yeah, but you're just, like,
really smart. You always have been.

193
00:11:02.853 --> 00:11:05.062
I can't even do a backflip.

194
00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:09.228
Thing is, I don't know what I wanna do.

195
00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:11.562
- I think...
- I wanna do a backflip.

196
00:11:11.687 --> 00:11:14.978
I think maybe I'll just do business,
'cause everything is business now.

197
00:11:15.103 --> 00:11:17.103
Every day, like, just all the time.

198
00:11:17.228 --> 00:11:18.978
We got to go
into business together.

199
00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.437
I heard that as well.

200
00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:23.395
Oh, my God!
These cheesy chips, man!

201
00:11:23.603 --> 00:11:25.937
- What?
- Ow!

202
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:29.062
Oi, I am actually going to
open my own restaurant

203
00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:30.895
and just serve cheesy chips.

204
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.395
Oi, you can come and work for me
while Em fucks off to finish school.

205
00:11:37.687 --> 00:11:39.561
I'll come.
I'll go every single day.

206
00:11:39.562 --> 00:11:41.436
- I think...
- I'll come three times.

207
00:11:41.437 --> 00:11:43.312
- I think we should...
- Breakfast and dinner.

208
00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:45.312
I think we should go to bed now.

209
00:11:45.437 --> 00:11:48.290
All I need to do to go to good school

210
00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.145
is if I get lots of As. Say As in...

211
00:11:51.312 --> 00:11:52.937
Em!

212
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.853
- Shut up! You're stressing me out.
- Oi! The thing is, though...

213
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.812
- ...is that...
- I'll hold it in that hand.

214
00:12:01.062 --> 00:12:03.520
...is that you two are actually
my best mates.

215
00:12:05.395 --> 00:12:07.603
- Gang, gang, gang.
- Gang, gang, gang.

216
00:13:46.895 --> 00:13:49.020
All right? I'm Paige.
Nice to meet you, ladies.

217
00:13:49.145 --> 00:13:51.312
- My name's Paddy.
- Nice to meet you.

218
00:14:03.187 --> 00:14:04.187
Whoo!

219
00:14:06.895 --> 00:14:08.895
Oi, I thought you left me for dead
with this clown.

220
00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:09.769
Oi!

221
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.145
You know, I love youse a lot,

222
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.270
but none of us are going to get laid
if we just hang out with each other.

223
00:14:14.478 --> 00:14:15.937
Last night was a disaster.

224
00:14:16.062 --> 00:14:17.103
Come on, then.

225
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.187
Everyone in the entire hotel
must be having a shower right now.

226
00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:27.478
Oi, Taz, you should wear this.
You'd look so sexy in it.

227
00:14:27.728 --> 00:14:29.312
Don't you think, Em?

228
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.812
I don't know,
looks mad uncomfortable to me.

229
00:14:34.812 --> 00:14:36.520
Skye, is this yours?

230
00:14:37.062 --> 00:14:39.394
- Yeah, why?
- Can I borrow it?

231
00:14:39.395 --> 00:14:40.894
Do you know
what you're doing with it?

232
00:14:40.895 --> 00:14:43.187
- Yeah, it's just...
- Come on, I'll show you.

233
00:14:56.687 --> 00:15:00.062
No my, my robot
is actually sick, though.

234
00:15:00.187 --> 00:15:02.020
Oh, my God!

235
00:15:02.687 --> 00:15:04.978
You look insane! What the fuck?

236
00:15:05.103 --> 00:15:08.520
Yeah, OK, I kinda get,
you look incredible.

237
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.520
- Ah, she's ready to go out!
- Whoo!

238
00:15:42.478 --> 00:15:43.562
Yo!

239
00:15:44.478 --> 00:15:45.853
Sexy!

240
00:15:48.937 --> 00:15:50.645
Oi, smoke show!

241
00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.478
I know you can hear me.
I can see you smiling.

242
00:16:07.395 --> 00:16:09.228
You lot going out later?

243
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.812
You should come round here for pres.

244
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.353
Yeah, I can ask the girls.

245
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.645
Fucking hell!
Talk about selective hearing.

246
00:16:22.728 --> 00:16:24.145
What's your name?

247
00:16:24.687 --> 00:16:25.812
Tara.

248
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.687
That's a nice name, innit?

249
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.895
I'm Badger.

250
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.895
That's a bit of a weird name, innit?

251
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.937
It's my nickname.

252
00:16:37.937 --> 00:16:39.020
Who's this?

253
00:16:40.353 --> 00:16:43.145
Romeo, Romeo, where is you? Yeah.

254
00:16:43.728 --> 00:16:45.478
Room 341, yeah?

255
00:16:45.812 --> 00:16:47.603
All right, easy, Tiger.

256
00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.312
We only just met.

257
00:16:53.187 --> 00:16:55.812
- Oi, no, what the fuck is that?
- What?

258
00:16:56.437 --> 00:16:57.436
Ohh...!

259
00:16:57.437 --> 00:16:58.853
- Who's done that?
- I did it.

260
00:16:58.978 --> 00:17:01.895
They're fucking ridiculous,
like two massive slugs on your face.

261
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.687
Wait, how old
do you think they are, though?

262
00:17:04.812 --> 00:17:08.145
Oi, guys, remember your phone
and keys and money.

263
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.270
I think, maybe, like, 19, 21.

264
00:17:11.478 --> 00:17:13.895
Yeah, so, what are we going to say?
We're, like, 18?

265
00:17:14.062 --> 00:17:16.478
You guys just going to fall in love
and leave me to it again?

266
00:17:16.479 --> 00:17:18.978
I think, like, 18,
just finished college, yeah?

267
00:17:19.312 --> 00:17:21.978
- Yeah, obviously I drive a BMW.
- Ha! You wish!

268
00:17:22.103 --> 00:17:24.853
- All right, come on, Taz!
- I think I'm doing a degree

269
00:17:24.854 --> 00:17:26.645
to be the next Prime Minister.

270
00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:29.645
Bro, if you can tell me
who the current Prime Minister is,

271
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.978
then I'll consider
you taking his job, yeah?

272
00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:33.269
Go on.

273
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.853
All right, for fuck's sake,
just come on! Shut up!

274
00:17:35.978 --> 00:17:37.603
Does this actually look all right?

275
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.062
- Mad uncomfortable, innit?
- Yeah.

276
00:17:41.395 --> 00:17:43.187
You look fit as fuck, though!

277
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.520
- So do you, mate.
- Quick.

278
00:17:46.645 --> 00:17:49.312
- Taz, your phone, I said!
- Yeah, give it, then.

279
00:17:49.313 --> 00:17:50.811
- I need my bag.
- Keys!

280
00:17:50.812 --> 00:17:53.228
Taz, you have got
to sort those eyebrows out.

281
00:17:53.853 --> 00:17:55.270
Paddy, your go.

282
00:17:55.395 --> 00:17:57.395
Nah, it's Paige's go.

283
00:17:57.603 --> 00:18:01.437
Never have I ever crashed a quad
into a parked car.

284
00:18:01.562 --> 00:18:04.062
Badger this morning
still pissed out his head.

285
00:18:04.437 --> 00:18:06.020
I'm usually a sick driver.

286
00:18:06.228 --> 00:18:08.311
I fucking drive vans for a living.
It's me job.

287
00:18:08.312 --> 00:18:10.752
You don't crash them into parked cars
at work, though, do you?

288
00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:15.603
Never have I ever had a threesome.

289
00:18:24.062 --> 00:18:26.520
- Get shots out.
- Yeah, let's get some shots.

290
00:18:26.728 --> 00:18:28.187
There's one.

291
00:18:31.687 --> 00:18:33.062
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

292
00:19:01.687 --> 00:19:03.895
Spin, spin.
Faster, faster, faster, go on.

293
00:19:04.228 --> 00:19:06.437
Three, two, one...

294
00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:07.978
Stop! Stop!

295
00:19:08.978 --> 00:19:11.498
Oi, no, spillage is lickage, it's fine.

296
00:19:11.499 --> 00:19:14.020
- Go on, Em!
- That is disgusting.

297
00:19:14.145 --> 00:19:15.937
What you doing?

298
00:19:16.062 --> 00:19:17.415
- No, no, no, no...
- Yeah!

299
00:19:17.416 --> 00:19:18.770
I saw that. That was cheating.

300
00:19:20.187 --> 00:19:23.228
Do you know where the vet's are?
'Cause I got two swans that are sick.

301
00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:34.062
Never have I ever had sex.

302
00:19:34.562 --> 00:19:36.687
Fucking hell!
Come off it, we're not 12.

303
00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:42.728
Never have I ever slept
with two birds in one night.

304
00:19:43.062 --> 00:19:45.437
I'm not drinking that
'cause I'm a fucking saint.

305
00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.187
- Oi.
- Chill out.

306
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.270
What happens on holiday
stays on holiday!

307
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.353
- What are you doing?
- I was only joking, babe.

308
00:19:56.478 --> 00:19:58.228
I wasn't going to call you out, obviously.

309
00:19:58.229 --> 00:19:59.394
Yeah, sure!

310
00:19:59.395 --> 00:20:01.895
No one cares if you're a virgin,
it's very chill.

311
00:20:01.896 --> 00:20:04.437
So, why are you bringing it up, then?

312
00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:07.312
'Cause it's funny.

313
00:20:08.395 --> 00:20:09.936
It's not funny.

314
00:20:09.937 --> 00:20:12.228
Skye, it's not funny.

315
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.853
Got a drink?

316
00:20:14.645 --> 00:20:16.770
Paddy is fit, though!

317
00:20:17.187 --> 00:20:18.853
You should try it with him.

318
00:20:19.562 --> 00:20:20.895
Or I might.

319
00:20:20.896 --> 00:20:22.062
Oh!

320
00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:26.603
Oi!

321
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.020
Whoo!

322
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.187
Oi, matchy-matchy, night bossman.

323
00:20:49.728 --> 00:20:52.437
Top graft on these lot,
they're about as cool as your sister.

324
00:20:52.438 --> 00:20:54.270
Chill out, mush,
we're on holiday!

325
00:20:54.271 --> 00:20:55.311
What's the matter?

326
00:20:55.312 --> 00:20:57.186
Did you hear?
They're talking about us.

327
00:20:57.187 --> 00:20:59.145
We need to, like,
not let on our age at all.

328
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.686
- To them.
- Yeah.

329
00:21:00.687 --> 00:21:03.353
Ooh, I miss my BMW so much!

330
00:21:03.853 --> 00:21:05.270
Subtle!

331
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.770
Listen. Listen.

332
00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:09.687
Do you think Paige is gay?

333
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.603
Are you joking?

334
00:21:12.728 --> 00:21:14.727
- J... I don't know.
- Are you joking?

335
00:21:14.728 --> 00:21:16.728
- Are you telling a joke?
- Let's hope she's gay.

336
00:21:16.729 --> 00:21:18.145
Of course she's gay.

337
00:21:19.353 --> 00:21:20.562
Oooh!

338
00:21:23.062 --> 00:21:24.228
I saved that!

339
00:21:24.853 --> 00:21:27.228
- Tipped it straight over.
- Don't lie. That went right in.

340
00:21:27.895 --> 00:21:29.812
- Fuck off!
- That's cheating.

341
00:21:29.978 --> 00:21:32.228
- Right, come on.
- Look at you sat down.

342
00:21:32.478 --> 00:21:33.686
- Come on.
- No!

343
00:21:33.687 --> 00:21:34.895
What the fuck!

344
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.228
Let's go.

345
00:21:45.728 --> 00:21:47.187
Come on, get it down you.

346
00:21:47.188 --> 00:21:48.603
Come on Badger.

347
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.978
Uh, ah, Malia!

348
00:22:19.812 --> 00:22:21.770
Oi! Paddy! Move.

349
00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:36.520
I'm in a bad way!

350
00:22:39.437 --> 00:22:40.895
...two, three!

351
00:22:43.312 --> 00:22:44.937
Feeling any better?

352
00:22:45.687 --> 00:22:47.187
No.

353
00:22:48.228 --> 00:22:49.520
I think I can help.

354
00:22:49.521 --> 00:22:51.103
Um...

355
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.020
So, I sold my hoover
the other day, yeah?

356
00:22:54.312 --> 00:22:55.312
Yeah.

357
00:22:55.437 --> 00:22:58.062
'Cause all it was doing
was collecting dust.

358
00:23:02.103 --> 00:23:05.437
Think! I got more, I got more.

359
00:23:05.562 --> 00:23:10.770
What is the difference
between a plum and a rabbit?

360
00:23:12.353 --> 00:23:13.812
I don't know.

361
00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:17.644
One is purple, and one isn't...

362
00:23:17.645 --> 00:23:19.978
- Oh, wait! No, I got it wrong.
- Oh!

363
00:23:20.145 --> 00:23:22.062
I got it wrong.

364
00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:24.603
No, no, no...

365
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.437
You're good.

366
00:23:26.562 --> 00:23:28.978
I don't think you've got
anything else left, to be honest.

367
00:23:34.353 --> 00:23:38.353
Why... Why do you never see
pigs hiding in trees?

368
00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:42.978
'Cause they're pretty good at it.

369
00:24:27.853 --> 00:24:29.478
Oi, what's that?

370
00:24:30.645 --> 00:24:33.687
Nah! Nah...!
You little cheating bastard.

371
00:24:33.853 --> 00:24:37.395
No, that's a classic one.
I'm going, I'm going.

372
00:24:41.478 --> 00:24:42.770
Shh...

373
00:24:55.562 --> 00:24:56.812
Nah.

374
00:24:57.645 --> 00:24:58.978
Bedtime.

375
00:25:27.437 --> 00:25:30.228
Come on, girls.
Up you get, you beautiful lot.

376
00:25:30.229 --> 00:25:32.415
Buses for Crush in five. Let's go.

377
00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:34.603
Oi! Hurry up! Crush is happening!

378
00:25:34.812 --> 00:25:35.894
Let's go!

379
00:25:35.895 --> 00:25:38.103
See you at gate in five!

380
00:25:38.395 --> 00:25:39.687
No.

381
00:25:39.812 --> 00:25:41.645
Surely, we have more
than five minutes, no?

382
00:25:41.978 --> 00:25:43.686
Why are we doing this to ourselves?

383
00:25:43.687 --> 00:25:46.353
No, if it's started,
we got to get a move on.

384
00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:48.645
We can be a bit late.

385
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.061
Oh, my God.

386
00:25:53.062 --> 00:25:55.062
- Come on.
- Look at the state of him.

387
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.937
See you in a bit, yeah?
Come Badger.

388
00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:08.353
I didn't bring any.

389
00:26:08.354 --> 00:26:10.062
Oi! Put this on.

390
00:26:11.562 --> 00:26:13.187
What did he just say?

391
00:26:13.188 --> 00:26:15.103
He's so fit.

392
00:26:18.187 --> 00:26:19.770
Everything hurts.

393
00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:23.603
I think that with this...

394
00:26:23.728 --> 00:26:26.312
- Skye, how does this work?
- Underneath.

395
00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:28.228
You need to cover your bits.

396
00:26:30.478 --> 00:26:33.770
I swear to God,
you guys need to get some life!

397
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.353
The only way through this for me
is with another drink.

398
00:26:38.478 --> 00:26:41.228
- No!
- What's that called? Dog of hair?

399
00:26:41.353 --> 00:26:43.228
- Dog of hair!
- Hair of dog.

400
00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:46.228
- That's a thing.
- Yeah, my mum does it all the time.

401
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.062
See? It's proper.

402
00:26:48.187 --> 00:26:50.311
I'm not fucking dressing you.
I'm not your mum.

403
00:26:50.312 --> 00:26:52.707
- Thanks, mum.
- Where's the hair straighteners?

404
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:55.103
No, wait, Skye,
I need something else on with it.

405
00:26:55.228 --> 00:26:56.853
- What? What?
- It's see-through.

406
00:26:56.978 --> 00:26:58.228
It's not that see-through!

407
00:26:58.353 --> 00:27:00.937
In the water it will be.
I thought this is a pool party.

408
00:27:01.187 --> 00:27:04.290
Right come on orange!
Come on, that's it.

409
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:07.395
Come on, girls!
Let's get it down you!

410
00:27:07.728 --> 00:27:09.645
Use those double-Ds!

411
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.353
How are they not choking on that?

412
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.520
That's it, girls!
Double-Ds, babes!

413
00:27:17.312 --> 00:27:18.937
We have a winner!
Well done, babes.

414
00:27:19.103 --> 00:27:20.687
Well done Sir, that's fantastic.

415
00:27:20.978 --> 00:27:22.270
One more girl! Anyone!

416
00:27:23.187 --> 00:27:25.770
- Taz! Taz!
- No, Skye.

417
00:27:25.895 --> 00:27:27.270
We've got one here! Taz!

418
00:27:29.062 --> 00:27:30.603
In the green, yeah? Come on!

419
00:27:30.728 --> 00:27:33.395
Come on, baby girl,
you got this one, you got this!

420
00:27:33.396 --> 00:27:36.645
One brave boy to play the game.

421
00:27:36.853 --> 00:27:39.312
Hey, here we go.
Look at him, he's eager.

422
00:27:39.437 --> 00:27:41.228
- You all right, bruv? Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:27:41.353 --> 00:27:43.228
Right, up there you pop.
Go on, son.

424
00:27:43.437 --> 00:27:45.895
Go on, Taz. Whoo!

425
00:27:46.687 --> 00:27:48.187
- Oh!
- Hello, little flower.

426
00:27:48.312 --> 00:27:49.394
How are you?

427
00:27:49.395 --> 00:27:50.603
- You okay?
- Yeah.

428
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.895
- Who've we got?
- I'm Tara.

429
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.270
Hello, Tara!

430
00:27:54.437 --> 00:27:55.977
You know what this kind of game is?

431
00:27:55.978 --> 00:27:58.644
- I guess so.
- It's a bit naughty. Are you sure?

432
00:27:58.645 --> 00:28:01.228
All right, he's got a big fake willy,
that looks like a beer,

433
00:28:01.229 --> 00:28:02.895
and you're going to drink it.

434
00:28:03.062 --> 00:28:04.186
Right, ready?

435
00:28:04.187 --> 00:28:07.395
Beer in the mouth, blowjob-style.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

436
00:28:08.312 --> 00:28:11.728
That's it, that's it!
Go on, get back in there!

437
00:28:12.187 --> 00:28:13.603
That's it! Not in her eyes.

438
00:28:14.645 --> 00:28:17.445
That's it. More, more, more, more.
Go on, keep going. Push it. Push it!

439
00:28:17.687 --> 00:28:20.603
Put your back into it, mate.
That's it, that's it, that's it!

440
00:28:20.812 --> 00:28:22.270
Keep going, keep going!

441
00:28:22.395 --> 00:28:24.937
Get in there!
That's it, that's it, that's it!

442
00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:28.103
Come on, open your mouth more,
Jesus Christ!

443
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.270
No boy's going to be happy with you!

444
00:28:30.395 --> 00:28:31.853
Christ!

445
00:28:32.103 --> 00:28:33.395
Tragic. I love you though.

446
00:28:33.728 --> 00:28:35.687
Yeah, I'm not good at that game.

447
00:28:35.812 --> 00:28:37.437
I dunno, you look pretty good to me.

448
00:28:37.562 --> 00:28:39.937
- Come on, guys! All right!
- Another one?

449
00:28:40.062 --> 00:28:41.645
- That's enough.
- That's enough.

450
00:28:41.646 --> 00:28:43.103
Off, off! You lost.

451
00:28:43.895 --> 00:28:45.436
You lost, girl!

452
00:28:45.437 --> 00:28:47.352
You can cuddle
in your own time.

453
00:28:47.353 --> 00:28:50.020
- Right, we need another boy!
- One more boy, please.

454
00:28:52.353 --> 00:28:54.020
Come on!

455
00:28:55.728 --> 00:28:57.520
You had a good time, yeah?

456
00:28:57.645 --> 00:29:00.562
Let me see those hands up! Yeah?

457
00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:03.228
If you've got a drink in your hands,
down it!

458
00:29:03.353 --> 00:29:06.062
Go! Now! Go, go, go! Down it!

459
00:29:06.063 --> 00:29:07.312
Beautiful, I like that.

460
00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:11.270
Who else is fucked?

461
00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:12.978
Where are you?

462
00:29:22.353 --> 00:29:24.020
Wait, it's fine.

463
00:29:25.853 --> 00:29:27.728
It's still fine. It still works.

464
00:29:32.062 --> 00:29:33.770
No, no! Stop it!

465
00:29:35.478 --> 00:29:36.812
Aah, get off me.

466
00:29:37.937 --> 00:29:40.353
Don't you think he's kinda fit, yeah?

467
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.812
I mean, he's a complete clown, no?

468
00:29:47.812 --> 00:29:50.145
No, but a sexy clown.

469
00:29:50.437 --> 00:29:52.812
Come on, I think he's proper jokes.

470
00:29:53.853 --> 00:29:55.437
Nah, he's butters.

471
00:29:57.562 --> 00:29:59.062
You can do much better.

472
00:30:01.895 --> 00:30:03.062
Come on.

473
00:30:36.978 --> 00:30:38.103
Taz!

474
00:31:01.978 --> 00:31:04.103
Yes, Malia! Yes!

475
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.187
What you telling me, guys,
you had a good night, yeah?

476
00:31:08.978 --> 00:31:11.812
We're about to get you lot
so fucking horny.

477
00:31:11.813 --> 00:31:13.270
So fucking ready!

478
00:31:13.562 --> 00:31:14.644
Let's have it.

479
00:31:14.645 --> 00:31:16.603
Let's fucking have it Malia!
Come one guys.

480
00:31:16.604 --> 00:31:18.269
Sorry, I just stepped on you.

481
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:19.769
We're drunk.
We're fucking drunk.

482
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.312
OK, we're going to play a game.
We're going to play a last game.

483
00:31:22.313 --> 00:31:23.602
Final game of the night, yeah?

484
00:31:23.603 --> 00:31:25.144
- It's a mad one.
- It's a big one.

485
00:31:25.145 --> 00:31:26.853
You got to give it your all, okay?
What do we need?

486
00:31:26.854 --> 00:31:28.770
- You going to do it?
- If you do it with me.

487
00:31:28.771 --> 00:31:29.895
Yeah, OK.

488
00:31:31.312 --> 00:31:32.853
OK, let's do this...

489
00:31:34.062 --> 00:31:35.270
Come on.

490
00:31:35.437 --> 00:31:36.727
One more, right?

491
00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:39.102
Final!
It's the fucking final, guys.

492
00:31:39.103 --> 00:31:42.270
Get your game faces on.
Stretch it out! Ready?

493
00:31:42.478 --> 00:31:44.562
We need two boys
up on this stage now.

494
00:31:44.563 --> 00:31:45.686
Get me two boys!

495
00:31:45.687 --> 00:31:48.228
- Who've we got? Hands up!
- So many hands!

496
00:31:48.229 --> 00:31:50.520
I can't hear you.

497
00:31:50.645 --> 00:31:51.687
Who's wants it?

498
00:31:51.812 --> 00:31:53.228
Oi, oi, look who it is.

499
00:31:53.353 --> 00:31:56.312
Yes, let's have our loser from
earlier back, come on, in the blue.

500
00:31:56.437 --> 00:31:58.562
Let's get you up.
Prove yourself this time.

501
00:31:59.937 --> 00:32:01.687
Let's go!

502
00:32:04.395 --> 00:32:05.978
Yeah!

503
00:32:06.312 --> 00:32:08.478
- Who we got here?
- Up you get, up you get, up you get!

504
00:32:08.479 --> 00:32:09.603
Badger.

505
00:32:10.103 --> 00:32:11.478
Badger!

506
00:32:12.478 --> 00:32:14.437
Over here we got Badger!

507
00:32:15.353 --> 00:32:18.187
Badger! Badger! Badger!

508
00:32:18.312 --> 00:32:19.937
What's your name, boy?

509
00:32:20.062 --> 00:32:21.937
My name's Tom
and I'm from fucking London!

510
00:32:21.938 --> 00:32:23.770
Tom from fucking London, yeah!

511
00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:25.145
We love a Londoner!

512
00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:30.227
Oi! Now, listen up,
the game we are playing

513
00:32:30.228 --> 00:32:35.187
is these two lovely boys have got
to get fucking hard, all right?

514
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.770
- We need some girls!
- We need some fucking girls.

515
00:32:45.145 --> 00:32:47.478
- Come on...
- Oh, no.

516
00:32:47.603 --> 00:32:50.353
Oh, this one's a lucky boy, eh?

517
00:32:50.937 --> 00:32:53.853
Three girls over here.
That's it, over here! That's it.

518
00:32:53.978 --> 00:32:56.520
That is amazing technique.
How are you not hard?

519
00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.853
Ooh, Jesus Christ, she's gagging.

520
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:02.437
Come on, Badger,
go to your happy place, mate.

521
00:33:02.562 --> 00:33:04.603
Go on, girls! That's it!

522
00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.937
That's it! Oh, my God!

523
00:33:07.062 --> 00:33:10.270
Yeah! My fucking boy!

524
00:33:13.228 --> 00:33:15.020
Let's go, darling.
Go on, deep-throat him.

525
00:33:15.145 --> 00:33:17.353
Yes! Yes!

526
00:33:17.687 --> 00:33:19.770
What are we saying?
What are we fucking saying?

527
00:33:21.687 --> 00:33:23.395
Yes, yes, yes! He's hard!
Badger is hard!

528
00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:39.895
Oh.

529
00:34:02.187 --> 00:34:03.270
Skye?

530
00:34:04.895 --> 00:34:06.145
Yeah.

531
00:34:06.853 --> 00:34:08.687
Is that bed free yet?

532
00:34:15.228 --> 00:34:16.645
Yeah, mate.

533
00:34:17.062 --> 00:34:18.520
Go on.

534
00:34:18.645 --> 00:34:20.562
And take the pan with you, innit?

535
00:34:23.978 --> 00:34:25.520
Oh fuck!

536
00:34:26.145 --> 00:34:27.187
Thanks.

537
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:38.437
Yo!

538
00:34:38.562 --> 00:34:41.770
You've got a big smirk on your face.
Have you got something to tell us?

539
00:34:41.978 --> 00:34:42.977
Go on!

540
00:34:42.978 --> 00:34:45.353
Go on, get in there!
He just got a second.

541
00:34:45.478 --> 00:34:46.812
Shh!

542
00:34:47.145 --> 00:34:48.395
Please, Badger.

543
00:34:48.562 --> 00:34:51.103
I wondered when youse lot would surface.

544
00:34:51.228 --> 00:34:52.603
Morning.

545
00:34:55.937 --> 00:34:57.645
Not feeling too good, lass?

546
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.895
Get some brekkie down ya,
round two starting soon.

547
00:35:02.145 --> 00:35:04.395
Fucking hell, you're really in
for the worst, aren't you?

548
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.728
I thought you southern fairies knew
how to party, you fucking jokers.

549
00:35:08.103 --> 00:35:10.478
Don't feel very jokes right now.

550
00:35:21.103 --> 00:35:22.645
Gorgeous, pet!

551
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.395
Fuck!

552
00:35:29.687 --> 00:35:31.728
Why so early?

553
00:35:32.728 --> 00:35:34.645
I don't remember anything at all.

554
00:35:36.395 --> 00:35:37.937
Is Taz at theirs?

555
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.478
Must be.

556
00:35:44.145 --> 00:35:45.270
Hm.

557
00:35:53.895 --> 00:35:56.270
Eating's cheating, babe.

558
00:35:58.145 --> 00:35:59.770
Oh, my God, please stop.

559
00:35:59.895 --> 00:36:01.812
You're going to make me sick again.

560
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.478
What, you want some?

561
00:36:07.478 --> 00:36:09.520
Oi, do us a favour
and wake Tara up.

562
00:36:09.645 --> 00:36:11.562
Me and her have got
some unfinished business.

563
00:36:11.728 --> 00:36:14.853
We all know how you finish
your business now, Badger.

564
00:36:15.895 --> 00:36:17.353
You lot up for pool?

565
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.937
- Yeah.
- Em?

566
00:36:20.437 --> 00:36:22.228
- Yeah.
- Worst bit is, yeah,

567
00:36:22.353 --> 00:36:23.603
I've got no memory of it.

568
00:36:24.437 --> 00:36:27.353
Probably the greatest thing to ever
happen to me in my whole entire life.

569
00:36:27.354 --> 00:36:28.812
No memory.

570
00:36:29.562 --> 00:36:31.270
That was the best thing?

571
00:36:31.645 --> 00:36:33.394
Hopefully,
them girls feel the same.

572
00:36:33.395 --> 00:36:35.145
Yeah, I hope
they don't remember it either.

573
00:36:36.145 --> 00:36:38.395
Your life sounds proper shit.

574
00:36:39.187 --> 00:36:40.395
Rinsed.

575
00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.353
Oi! Last night
were crazy, you know?

576
00:36:42.478 --> 00:36:44.707
Taz, come out here! Mush!

577
00:36:44.708 --> 00:36:46.937
Stop screaming, you lunatic.

578
00:36:47.562 --> 00:36:49.312
Well, if you won't get her
out here...

579
00:36:50.645 --> 00:36:52.227
She's with you, no?

580
00:36:52.228 --> 00:36:53.957
Yeah! Ain't she at yours?

581
00:36:53.958 --> 00:36:55.687
No, why would she be here?

582
00:36:56.478 --> 00:36:58.062
Well, she came back with you.

583
00:36:58.853 --> 00:37:00.645
She not at yours?

584
00:37:01.228 --> 00:37:03.978
He's joking about.
Just bring her out.

585
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.353
On my Mum's life, I'm not joking.

586
00:37:11.312 --> 00:37:12.687
Check your phone.

587
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.145
She would've said something.

588
00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.520
This is typical Tara behaviour.

589
00:37:20.145 --> 00:37:21.770
She's always on one.

590
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.770
See, last seen in the apartment, now.

591
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.228
Damn!

592
00:37:35.562 --> 00:37:37.228
I guess girl got laid.

593
00:37:41.437 --> 00:37:43.978
What she doing
leaving her phone here?

594
00:37:45.728 --> 00:37:47.770
- Why are you being weird?
- I'm not.

595
00:37:50.645 --> 00:37:53.728
- Oi, just look proper, yeah?
- Yeah, check.

596
00:37:53.729 --> 00:37:55.562
Mate, I'd know if she came here.

597
00:37:55.812 --> 00:37:57.603
She's definitely still on it.

598
00:38:07.145 --> 00:38:08.770
I don't like it.

599
00:38:09.395 --> 00:38:10.812
Just chill out.

600
00:38:12.437 --> 00:38:15.812
It's nothing major, is it?
Just fucking stop panicking.

601
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.062
Should have moved quicker, bro.

602
00:38:18.853 --> 00:38:21.228
Don't you get jealous, you.
It doesn't suit you.

603
00:38:24.895 --> 00:38:26.978
What are you trying to get at?

604
00:38:30.562 --> 00:38:31.978
Where is she, then?

605
00:38:32.228 --> 00:38:34.228
- You chat shit.
- I don't know.

606
00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:38.020
I can't just sit here.
I'm going to talk to reception, okay?

607
00:38:45.687 --> 00:38:47.457
See you down the pool, yeah?

608
00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:49.228
Come on, boys, let's go.

609
00:38:49.812 --> 00:38:51.187
Badger, you coming?

610
00:38:58.353 --> 00:38:59.687
Oi!

611
00:39:08.603 --> 00:39:10.437
Do you want to come and chill here?

612
00:39:38.187 --> 00:39:40.312
I'm so proud of Tara, man.

613
00:39:43.645 --> 00:39:44.978
Proud?

614
00:39:48.937 --> 00:39:50.895
I bet she's finally...

615
00:39:55.228 --> 00:39:57.145
She's wanted to for so long.

616
00:40:00.395 --> 00:40:02.103
What are you on about?

617
00:40:07.145 --> 00:40:09.187
She's a massive virgin, mate.

618
00:40:23.895 --> 00:40:25.603
Do you think she's all right?

619
00:40:27.187 --> 00:40:29.437
Mate, she's having
the time of her life.

620
00:40:37.062 --> 00:40:38.645
Are you jealous?

621
00:40:40.603 --> 00:40:43.062
No, it's...
it's not that, it's just...

622
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:49.937
Well, we could go looking for her.

623
00:40:51.145 --> 00:40:53.020
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

624
00:41:13.937 --> 00:41:15.687
Ho, ho, this one's a lucky boy, eh?

625
00:41:18.103 --> 00:41:19.311
Let's go darling!

626
00:41:19.312 --> 00:41:20.770
Go on, deep throat him.

627
00:41:21.687 --> 00:41:23.062
Jesus Christ, she's gagging.

628
00:41:25.937 --> 00:41:26.978
Hi darling.

629
00:41:48.562 --> 00:41:49.977
All right, you?

630
00:41:49.978 --> 00:41:51.645
- Paddy!
- What are you doing?

631
00:41:51.646 --> 00:41:53.937
Um... not going home.

632
00:41:54.437 --> 00:41:56.562
Is it past your bedtime already?

633
00:41:57.562 --> 00:41:59.103
Where's everyone else?

634
00:41:59.853 --> 00:42:01.394
Still going, I think.

635
00:42:01.395 --> 00:42:03.915
Yeah? Oh, come on,
you can't go to bed.

636
00:42:03.916 --> 00:42:06.437
Me and you are always
last ones standing.

637
00:42:06.812 --> 00:42:09.062
You're not going leave me
on my own, are you?

638
00:42:11.478 --> 00:42:12.895
We go to beach?

639
00:42:14.895 --> 00:42:17.103
Come on! I know you want to.

640
00:42:18.228 --> 00:42:19.895
Come on!

641
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.270
- Sit there.
- Here?

642
00:42:33.895 --> 00:42:35.937
You don't fancy the strip, then, no?

643
00:42:35.938 --> 00:42:37.937
- No.
- Why?

644
00:42:38.895 --> 00:42:40.437
I don't know.

645
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.687
Don't you think it's mad how, like,

646
00:42:46.437 --> 00:42:48.353
sand just gets everywhere?

647
00:42:48.895 --> 00:42:50.395
No, we're on a beach.

648
00:42:51.853 --> 00:42:53.311
What are you on about?

649
00:42:53.312 --> 00:42:56.520
Yeah but, it just gets everywhere.

650
00:43:05.895 --> 00:43:08.770
I've not noticed it before,
but you're proper beautiful, you know?

651
00:43:15.978 --> 00:43:19.645
Some kind of compliment
in there somewhere.

652
00:43:21.853 --> 00:43:23.853
You're into our lad, though,
aren't you?

653
00:43:29.645 --> 00:43:31.645
So, what are you into, then?

654
00:43:35.062 --> 00:43:36.145
Hmm...

655
00:43:37.603 --> 00:43:40.603
Pasta and cheesy chips.

656
00:43:42.103 --> 00:43:44.187
You're fucking jokes, you!

657
00:43:53.645 --> 00:43:55.770
Oi, let's go skinny dipping.

658
00:43:55.937 --> 00:43:57.103
- No.
- Why?

659
00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.062
- 'Cause it's so cold.
- Come on! Come on!

660
00:43:59.063 --> 00:44:00.895
Paddy, no! No!

661
00:44:01.103 --> 00:44:03.853
Paddy, no! I don't want to!
Put me down!

662
00:44:03.854 --> 00:44:05.853
Paddy! No!

663
00:44:06.062 --> 00:44:08.645
No! Put me down!

664
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:13.020
- It's all right once you're in it!
- It's not, alright at all Paddy.

665
00:44:13.021 --> 00:44:14.228
It's fucking freezing!

666
00:44:14.645 --> 00:44:16.270
Come here.

667
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:18.353
Come here.

668
00:44:22.187 --> 00:44:24.145
You're going to lose all your teeth.

669
00:44:26.228 --> 00:44:27.645
Come here.

670
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.103
What you laughing at?

671
00:44:35.478 --> 00:44:37.187
Paddy, stop!

672
00:44:37.312 --> 00:44:39.395
- What?
- Stop.

673
00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.187
All right, I won't touch you.

674
00:44:51.895 --> 00:44:53.770
No!

675
00:44:54.103 --> 00:44:55.478
- Come here.
- What?

676
00:44:55.687 --> 00:44:56.978
I'm cold!

677
00:44:59.478 --> 00:45:02.437
I think it's a bit unfair how it don't
work both ways, though, really.

678
00:45:02.562 --> 00:45:04.270
I'm cold.

679
00:45:07.437 --> 00:45:08.895
Come on, then.

680
00:45:22.103 --> 00:45:23.895
Weren't me, boss!

681
00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.895
What?

682
00:45:26.187 --> 00:45:28.853
I can't help it when it's wiggling
in front of me like that, can I?

683
00:45:30.353 --> 00:45:31.978
What are you so uptight for?

684
00:45:32.145 --> 00:45:33.437
I'm not.

685
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.145
I thought you were the fun one.

686
00:45:36.895 --> 00:45:38.770
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

687
00:45:39.728 --> 00:45:41.020
Come on.

688
00:45:42.187 --> 00:45:43.812
Wet clothes make you colder.

689
00:45:57.603 --> 00:46:00.312
Chill out, it's not like
I'm asking you to marry me, is it?

690
00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:04.645
What do you mean,
this isn't the wedding?

691
00:46:16.853 --> 00:46:18.145
Yeah?

692
00:46:26.853 --> 00:46:28.270
Yeah?

693
00:46:31.228 --> 00:46:32.728
Yeah.

694
00:48:34.062 --> 00:48:36.103
What's your name?

695
00:48:36.104 --> 00:48:37.562
Tara.

696
00:48:38.478 --> 00:48:39.687
What's yours?

697
00:48:40.062 --> 00:48:41.353
I'm Fi.

698
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.687
- Oi, you lot, this is Tara.
- Tara!

699
00:49:03.728 --> 00:49:05.603
Are you okay?

700
00:49:06.353 --> 00:49:07.937

702
00:49:11.728 --> 00:49:12.977
Um.

703
00:49:12.978 --> 00:49:14.687
We got split up.

704
00:50:11.395 --> 00:50:13.520
Do you want to come back?

705
00:50:13.687 --> 00:50:14.978

00:50:35.895 --> 00:50:37.478
Three, two, one!

711
00:50:41.478 --> 00:50:42.978
That was stunning!

712
00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:50.978
You can sleep on the sofa,
I can go in with Josh.

713
00:50:51.103 --> 00:50:52.937
No, no, no.

714
00:50:53.062 --> 00:50:55.187
I'm just going to have a quick nap,

715
00:50:55.312 --> 00:50:57.103
and then, then I'll be fine.

716
00:50:57.603 --> 00:50:59.312
- That's not happening.
- It's fine.

717
00:50:59.478 --> 00:51:00.812
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

718
00:51:00.937 --> 00:51:04.312
So, like, are you and Josh
together, like?

719
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:08.437
No, no, no, no, we're, like,
we're, like, basically family.

720
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.937
- No, right, come on, seriously, in!
- No!

721
00:51:12.187 --> 00:51:13.312
- Yes!
- This is comfy!

722
00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:16.999
Well, at least just stay inside.
Everyone's, like, proper sound.

723
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.562
No, I know, everyone is so nice,
but I'm... this is good for me.

724
00:51:21.062 --> 00:51:24.228
All right, fine. Okay, but you know
where we are if you need us.

725
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:25.894
Thank you.

726
00:51:25.895 --> 00:51:28.187
- Night!
- Good night.

727
00:53:13.895 --> 00:53:15.187
Guess who's back!

728
00:53:15.188 --> 00:53:16.395
Hey!

729
00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:19.978
- Tara!
- I fucking told you lot.

730
00:53:20.895 --> 00:53:22.061
Snap!

731
00:53:22.062 --> 00:53:24.020
Right, right, right.
That's one that you've won.

732
00:53:24.021 --> 00:53:25.353
Yeah, alright...

733
00:53:25.354 --> 00:53:26.687
You must have...

734
00:53:28.145 --> 00:53:29.145
Snap!

735
00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.186
Come on, details!

736
00:53:33.187 --> 00:53:34.687
You were going to say?

737
00:53:34.812 --> 00:53:37.478
It was a sick night.

738
00:53:58.937 --> 00:54:00.853
So, did you and Paige...?

739
00:54:01.312 --> 00:54:04.062
No, we were going to
this afternoon, but...

740
00:54:04.312 --> 00:54:05.770
I don't know, I think...

741
00:54:05.895 --> 00:54:08.145
I think she's kind of nervous,
you know?

742
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:11.228
Don't change the subject.

743
00:54:11.645 --> 00:54:13.312
Where've you been?

744
00:54:13.895 --> 00:54:15.937
You know, I was really freaking out.

745
00:54:16.312 --> 00:54:18.562
And, what,
you left your phone here, too.

746
00:54:21.645 --> 00:54:23.103
Taz.

747
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:29.228
I, I slept with Paddy.

748
00:54:32.103 --> 00:54:34.062
No fucking way!

749
00:54:37.895 --> 00:54:40.145
When? How did that happen?

750
00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.603
On the beach.

751
00:54:43.187 --> 00:54:44.978
Oh, on the beach!

752
00:54:47.395 --> 00:54:49.187
Sounds really romantic.

753
00:54:50.062 --> 00:54:51.520
No.

754
00:54:51.812 --> 00:54:53.312
Was it good?

755
00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.812
Um...

756
00:54:58.437 --> 00:55:02.145
And then I met
these absolute legends in a club,

757
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:06.353
danced for hours,
and then went back to their villa.

758
00:55:06.478 --> 00:55:09.145
And it was really mental,
but they were really cool, so...

759
00:55:10.103 --> 00:55:11.312
I was there all night.

760
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.520
So, what did I miss?

761
00:55:13.728 --> 00:55:15.020
Who was it?

762
00:55:17.603 --> 00:55:19.812
Oh, you're proper sneaky,
you know?

763
00:55:21.062 --> 00:55:22.562
All of this,
we got to stick together,

764
00:55:22.687 --> 00:55:24.437
have each other's back,
blah-blah-blah.

765
00:55:24.562 --> 00:55:27.020
Runs off, has sex and gets new mates.

766
00:55:27.312 --> 00:55:28.687
Who was it?

767
00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.853
Paddy.

768
00:55:32.937 --> 00:55:34.395
Oh my God!

769
00:55:36.937 --> 00:55:39.103
Holiday romance brewing!

770
00:55:39.437 --> 00:55:40.437
No.

771
00:55:40.562 --> 00:55:43.437
Don't you think it's weird that
he hasn't said anything to youse?

772
00:55:43.603 --> 00:55:45.645
No.

773
00:55:46.478 --> 00:55:48.520
I mean,
it'll defo happen again, won't it?

774
00:55:49.645 --> 00:55:52.437
Hey, come on.
Let's get back into it.

775
00:55:52.728 --> 00:55:54.728
There's much to be celebrating,
ain't there?

776
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.123
Get some more shots in!
You run out of shots?

777
00:56:00.124 --> 00:56:02.728
- All right, shots!
- Yeah, shots, shots!

778
00:56:02.729 --> 00:56:04.895

779
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:06.478
Yes!

780
00:56:06.603 --> 00:56:09.145
Round four, let's go!

781
00:56:12.228 --> 00:56:13.562
- Thank you.
- Ugh!

782
00:56:13.687 --> 00:56:15.062
Mm!

783
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:20.312

784
00:56:22.145 --> 00:56:25.145

- We'll have pres here.
- Yeah.

786
00:56:38.603 --> 00:56:40.853
Last night was very jokes.

787
00:56:55.103 --> 00:56:56.687
Oi, Taz.

788
00:56:57.812 --> 00:57:00.728
Do you think you're going to sleep
with Paddy again tonight?

789
00:57:01.603 --> 00:57:02.978
Mm, no.

790
00:57:15.395 --> 00:57:17.312
Guys, Mum's just text.

791
00:57:17.728 --> 00:57:19.812
The results,
apparently they've got them.

792
00:57:21.478 --> 00:57:22.895
Oh my God.

793
00:57:26.353 --> 00:57:29.145
- I don't think I can look.
- I'm going to shower.

794
00:57:29.312 --> 00:57:31.103
You not going to look?

795
00:57:31.312 --> 00:57:33.103
No, I know that I fucked it.

796
00:57:35.812 --> 00:57:37.062
Yeah, me too.

797
00:57:39.395 --> 00:57:40.936
She said I did it.

798
00:57:40.937 --> 00:57:43.437
Oh my God, yes mate,

Yo, we met these down at t' pool.

No, the more the merrier.

- Tara.
- Em, send me a cup!

816
00:59:33.853 --> 00:59:36.603
- Catch.
- Fucking hell. Sorry, love.

817
00:59:36.853 --> 00:59:38.395
I know what a Libra looks like

818
00:59:38.728 --> 00:59:39.853
Where's them balloons then?

819
00:59:40.145 --> 00:59:41.978
Yeah, come on,
let's go out for a fag.

820
00:59:41.979 --> 00:59:43.270
It's too warm in here.

821
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.978
- Oh.
- Take one of them.

822
00:59:48.353 --> 00:59:49.937
And you. Oi.

823
00:59:50.062 --> 00:59:51.312
Taz.

824
00:59:52.103 --> 00:59:53.603
You good?

825
00:59:59.687 --> 01:00:03.937
Imagine, yeah,
this genius got ten As!

826
01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:06.603
Let's get fucked up!

827
01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:11.353
Oi, shut up!
You did so fucking well.

828
01:00:11.478 --> 01:00:14.062
- So well!
- Wait, you looked?

829
01:00:14.187 --> 01:00:16.353
Yeah. Taz, I persuaded her, innit?

830
01:00:16.978 --> 01:00:19.812
I thought you said
you weren't going to check results.

831
01:00:19.937 --> 01:00:23.062
She might even be able
to come with me next year.

832
01:00:26.562 --> 01:00:28.102
Don't be sad, Taz.

833
01:00:28.103 --> 01:00:29.937
Whatever you do,
you're going to be great.

834
01:00:30.062 --> 01:00:32.645
When are we going?

835
01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:35.020
- Are we going soon?
- Come on, Taz.

836
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.187
Oh, it's going be so fun.

837
01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:41.312
White Party!

838
01:00:52.603 --> 01:00:55.353
We got to keep an eye on Em tonight.
She's already looking fucked.

839
01:00:55.478 --> 01:00:58.103
We're not going to babysit her, though.

840
01:00:58.228 --> 01:01:01.103
Like, it's results night,
she's worked for it.

841
01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.937
Pretty sure you don't need ten As
to open a restaurant anyway.

842
01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.437
I'll get you on front desk.

843
01:01:07.687 --> 01:01:10.103
What restaurant have you been to
what has a front desk?

844
01:01:10.228 --> 01:01:12.812
Two coats? Any bags?
Yeah, that's four pounds!

845
01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:15.812
That's not front desk,
that's a cloakroom!

846
01:01:15.978 --> 01:01:18.353
I'm not going to be working
on a cloakroom.

847
01:01:18.603 --> 01:01:21.187
Yeah, I'm not sure you've got
much choice at this point.

848
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.937
Nah, come on.

849
01:01:28.895 --> 01:01:30.145
I'm joking.

850
01:01:32.603 --> 01:01:35.062
I would be kinda jokes
in a cloakroom, though.

851
01:01:40.145 --> 01:01:42.187
So what, is Paddy good, then?

852
01:01:46.353 --> 01:01:47.770
Yeah, I guess.

853
01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.145
Like, he knew
what he was doing, innit?

854
01:01:53.562 --> 01:01:55.270
Yeah, he looks like it.

855
01:01:57.812 --> 01:01:59.270
Did he, like...

856
01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.353
pick you up and throw you
about and that?

857
01:02:03.978 --> 01:02:05.395
Kind of.

858
01:02:06.728 --> 01:02:08.603
Like, he's strong.

859
01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:14.187
Then you should deffo go
for round two with him.

860
01:02:25.312 --> 01:02:26.978
- That's yours.
- Thanks.

861
01:02:27.728 --> 01:02:31.103
All right, you two,
save it for the bedroom.

862
01:02:32.562 --> 01:02:34.062
You all right?

863
01:02:34.187 --> 01:02:35.603
Yeah, you all right?

864
01:02:39.812 --> 01:02:42.687
Sorry about last night.
I was trashed.

865
01:02:43.645 --> 01:02:45.270
What do you mean?

866
01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:50.728
It's fine.

867
01:03:16.437 --> 01:03:18.020
Fuck...

868
01:03:20.645 --> 01:03:21.895
Fucking, yeah...

869
01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:33.978
<i>It's giving me a migraine.</i>

870
01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.477
<i>Come on then, let's have a shot.</i>

871
01:03:36.478 --> 01:03:38.853
<i>No, I don't want vodka,
I just want a shot. Go on.</i>

872
01:05:42.895 --> 01:05:44.103
Oi oi!

873
01:05:44.812 --> 01:05:47.353
Where the fuck
have you been all night?

874
01:05:51.562 --> 01:05:53.353
We're going skinny dipping.

875
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.645
At the hotel?

876
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:59.478
No, at the beach.

877
01:06:00.562 --> 01:06:01.978
I'm good.

878
01:06:02.812 --> 01:06:05.978
Come on! It's your last night here.
Stop being a little weirdo.

879
01:06:06.895 --> 01:06:09.103
I don't wanna get sand everywhere.

880
01:06:09.645 --> 01:06:11.645
It's just fucking sand!

881
01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.978
I'm all right.

882
01:06:16.145 --> 01:06:17.812
Stop being a freak, Taz.

883
01:06:20.145 --> 01:06:21.187
Okay.

884
01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.062
Tara come on, I'm only joking.

885
01:06:29.562 --> 01:06:31.145
Oi, come Badger.

886
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.562
No. I'd better walk her back.

887
01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:37.020
Fuck!

888
01:06:45.145 --> 01:06:46.270
Oh ho!

889
01:06:48.353 --> 01:06:50.102
What you doing, bro?

890
01:06:50.103 --> 01:06:51.978
Going down t' beach?
Everyone's there.

891
01:06:51.979 --> 01:06:53.520
Yeah, of course.

892
01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:57.187
Come on. Paddy's coming.

893
01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:01.437
She loves it on t' beach, her.

894
01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.603
Come.

895
01:07:10.187 --> 01:07:11.770
I'll come and find you later on.

896
01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.062
Do you want a drink?

897
01:07:56.353 --> 01:07:57.353
Cuppa?

898
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:02.812
Yeah, sure.

899
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:09.103
What would you rather be,
a baby goat or a mata baby?

900
01:08:10.978 --> 01:08:12.853
What's a mata baby?

901
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.562
I don't know baby,
what's the matter with you?

902
01:08:24.937 --> 01:08:26.770
Do you want any sugar?

903
01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:28.895
Uh-huh.

904
01:11:12.187 --> 01:11:14.937
- Party! Party! Party!
- Taz! Taz!

905
01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:17.687
Where were you?
We missed you, mate.

906
01:11:18.895 --> 01:11:22.812
- Come on, gorgeous!
- Party! Party! Party! Party!

907
01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:25.937
- What time is it?
- We didn't come here to sleep.

908
01:11:26.062 --> 01:11:27.562
We bought you a present.

909
01:11:28.478 --> 01:11:30.353
- Got a dead weight!
- Sort her out.

910
01:11:30.728 --> 01:11:32.853
Wake up, you lazybones.

911
01:11:33.437 --> 01:11:35.812
- You're not even asleep.
- Come on!

912
01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.853
- What's the matter with you?
- Party! Party! Party!

913
01:11:38.978 --> 01:11:42.312
- Oi, Badger, where's the fags?
- Get up! Stop being lazy.

914
01:11:48.853 --> 01:11:50.145
Hi.

915
01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.645
Hi.

916
01:11:58.395 --> 01:12:00.020
I just want to say...

917
01:12:01.895 --> 01:12:03.978
last night were amazing.

918
01:12:12.478 --> 01:12:14.145
I'm asleep.

919
01:12:15.353 --> 01:12:17.103
I just came to say hi.

920
01:12:19.228 --> 01:12:20.520
Hi.

921
01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.312
What are you doing?

922
01:12:29.603 --> 01:12:31.187
Sleeping here.

923
01:12:44.145 --> 01:12:45.770
Did you not like it?

924
01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:54.937
Yo, I've got a drink
for you here, bro.

925
01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:56.812
I'm all right, me, bro.

926
01:12:57.437 --> 01:13:00.562
I'm good. I'm going to go to bed, me,
I'm pretty tired.

927
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.312
I'm a taken man now, aren't I?

928
01:13:22.895 --> 01:13:24.728
What are you wearing?

929
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.895
Get these off you, you'll be red hot.

930
01:13:46.812 --> 01:13:48.520
Everyone's here, Paddy,
and I'm asleep.

931
01:13:48.521 --> 01:13:50.228
All right, all right.

932
01:13:52.312 --> 01:13:53.937
<i>Taz?</i>

933
01:13:56.937 --> 01:13:58.187
<i>Tara?</i>

934
01:13:58.395 --> 01:13:59.853
Yeah, Em?

935
01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.520
<i>Love you.</i>

936
01:14:04.728 --> 01:14:06.270
I love you, too, mate.

937
01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.478
You all right?

938
01:14:10.853 --> 01:14:12.020
<i>Yeah.</i>

939
01:14:12.187 --> 01:14:13.687
<i>I am,</i>

940
01:14:14.312 --> 01:14:16.353
<i>but I'm a bit pissed, though, mate.</i>

941
01:14:17.562 --> 01:14:20.312
<i>I think I'm really going to
miss you next year.</i>

942
01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:22.978
<i>Are we still going to hang out?</i>

943
01:14:23.478 --> 01:14:25.145
Yeah, mate, we will.

944
01:14:25.812 --> 01:14:27.895
<i>We'll be best friends for life.</i>

945
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:30.353
Hm.

946
01:14:53.562 --> 01:14:55.687
Don't move. Let me do it.

947
01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:02.187
Am I too fast?

948
01:15:02.562 --> 01:15:04.353
You like it fast, don't you?

949
01:15:04.853 --> 01:15:06.519
<i>My neck is killing me...</i>

950
01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.562
<i>Let us in the bed, for fuck's sake.</i>

951
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:16.020
That floor is fucking rough,
mate, my neck's fucked.

952
01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:26.645
Told you you would.

953
01:15:28.978 --> 01:15:30.728
I love you, mate.

954
01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.437
Best holiday ever.

955
01:16:34.603 --> 01:16:36.562
Probably won't go out tonight.

956
01:16:40.645 --> 01:16:42.645
Went a bit hard, innit?

957
01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.687
You can't pretend you can't hear me.

958
01:16:59.187 --> 01:17:01.020
I made it onto your balcony now.

959
01:17:02.312 --> 01:17:04.228
Yeah, sorry, I'm just tired.

960
01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:10.227
Wake up legends!

961
01:17:10.228 --> 01:17:12.937
Mission complete! On t' next one!

962
01:17:13.187 --> 01:17:14.603
Round...

963
01:17:15.145 --> 01:17:17.062
Fucking what round is it?

964
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.603
Morning, gorgeous. All right?

965
01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:27.145
What you saying?

966
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.270
Nothing, I'm chilling, bro.

967
01:17:34.145 --> 01:17:36.020
Fucking hell! Good chat lads!

968
01:17:51.353 --> 01:17:53.395
He's a nightmare of a guy.

969
01:17:55.312 --> 01:17:56.687
Mm...

970
01:18:06.145 --> 01:18:07.853
I've known him since I were little.

971
01:18:09.812 --> 01:18:13.062
His mum and my mum,
they're best mates.

972
01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:22.145
And we live on the same street.

973
01:18:24.187 --> 01:18:25.812
That's nice.

974
01:18:50.312 --> 01:18:51.687
See you back home.

975
01:18:51.812 --> 01:18:53.978
Yeah, we'll come down.
It'll be well jokes.

976
01:18:54.103 --> 01:18:55.603
Yeah, or we'll come up.

977
01:18:55.728 --> 01:18:57.227
See how you northern lot do it.

978
01:18:57.228 --> 01:18:59.270
Anyway, we're all
coming back next year.

979
01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:01.353
Same time, same place, no excuses.

980
01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:03.062
Yeah, no excuses.

981
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:04.812
No early bedtimes either, Taz.

982
01:19:04.937 --> 01:19:06.186
Call her, then, innit.

983
01:19:06.187 --> 01:19:07.937
Make sure you text me
when you get home.

984
01:19:07.938 --> 01:19:09.562
You gave Paddy your number, yeah?

985
01:19:09.563 --> 01:19:10.937
See you later.

986
01:19:14.978 --> 01:19:16.415
- Bye.
- See ya.

987
01:19:16.416 --> 01:19:17.853
See you gorgeous!

988
01:21:22.395 --> 01:21:24.478
Uh, I'm going to get
some munch from here.

989
01:21:25.728 --> 01:21:27.062
What do youse want?

990
01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:29.437
- Chips if they have them.
- Yeah, chips also.

991
01:21:30.562 --> 01:21:31.853
Banging.

992
01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:37.145
Give us all the details then.

993
01:21:37.562 --> 01:21:39.687
There's not really anything to add to it.

994
01:21:44.062 --> 01:21:46.228
I reckon we'll come back next year.

995
01:21:52.312 --> 01:21:54.312
Oi, you did it again last night, innit?

996
01:22:00.062 --> 01:22:01.562
I swear!

997
01:22:03.145 --> 01:22:05.937
Oh, was it better
the second time, yeah?

998
01:22:12.478 --> 01:22:14.603
Why are you being sheepish?

999
01:22:14.728 --> 01:22:16.478
Come on, give us the details.

1000
01:22:16.687 --> 01:22:18.062
No.

1001
01:22:18.228 --> 01:22:20.437
It didn't count.
It weren't really proper.

1002
01:22:20.438 --> 01:22:23.103
- How can it not be proper?
- Here.

1003
01:22:25.645 --> 01:22:26.853
What are you pair saying?

1004
01:22:26.978 --> 01:22:28.915
Just saying about last night.

1005
01:22:28.916 --> 01:22:30.853
Taz is saying it didn't count.

1006
01:22:32.395 --> 01:22:33.687
He's fit.

1007
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.187
In my opinion, anyway.

1008
01:22:36.062 --> 01:22:37.353
I would have.

1009
01:22:39.728 --> 01:22:41.145
Yeah, he is fit.

1010
01:22:41.645 --> 01:22:43.978
Who'd have thought
you two would get laid the most?

1011
01:22:47.978 --> 01:22:49.728
Yeah, I don't know, he's just...

1012
01:22:50.228 --> 01:22:51.687
a weird guy, innit?

1013
01:22:52.062 --> 01:22:53.728
What do you mean,
he's a weird guy?

1014
01:22:53.729 --> 01:22:55.062
Forget him!

1015
01:22:56.395 --> 01:22:58.687
We're going out
as soon as we get home, yeah?

1016
01:22:59.062 --> 01:23:01.312
We got local man to get on, now!

1017
01:23:01.687 --> 01:23:03.812
Huh! Fuck Paddy, man!

1018
01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.895
You can do so much better.

1019
01:23:14.937 --> 01:23:16.353
Taz?

1020
01:23:21.145 --> 01:23:22.520
I like, I was...

1021
01:23:25.145 --> 01:23:26.687
asleep, so...

1022
01:23:33.103 --> 01:23:34.520
Are you saying...?

1023
01:23:38.312 --> 01:23:40.687
What, Taz, was he like that
with you both nights?

1024
01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.562
It's fine.

1025
01:23:58.562 --> 01:24:00.270
You should've said something, like.

1026
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:02.312
I didn't clock, I...

1027
01:24:05.062 --> 01:24:06.395
Taz...

1028
01:24:07.395 --> 01:24:09.937
No, you're right, I should've,
I should've said something.

1029
01:24:12.103 --> 01:24:13.353
It's fine.

1030
01:24:18.812 --> 01:24:20.020
No, it's not.

1031
01:24:20.645 --> 01:24:23.062
We should buy stuff here.
It's much cheaper.

1032
01:24:23.437 --> 01:24:26.020
I didn't even get a tattoo
or anything on this holiday.

1033
01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:28.645
You were busy.

1034
01:24:32.562 --> 01:24:34.145
Oi, smell that.

1035
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.561
- It's banging, that.
- Mm.

1036
01:24:37.562 --> 01:24:39.645
<i>- ...to London, Luton.</i>
- Yeah.

1037
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:41.978
Fuck! You guys know
this is our plane boarding, innit?

1038
01:24:42.687 --> 01:24:43.727
Come on!

1039
01:24:43.728 --> 01:24:46.395
<i>...the gate will be closing
in five minutes. Final call...</i>

1040
01:24:46.645 --> 01:24:48.687
Go! Go! Go! Go...

1041
01:25:03.937 --> 01:25:05.270
We got this.

1042
01:25:11.937 --> 01:25:13.937
We're coming home!
