00:19:06.603 --> 00:19:07.978
Stop! Stop!

344
00:19:08.978 --> 00:19:11.562
Oi, no, spillage is lickage, it's fine.

345
00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:14.020
- [Tara] Go on, Em!
- [Paige] That is disgusting.

346
00:19:14.145 --> 00:19:15.937
What you doing?

347
00:19:16.062 --> 00:19:17.312
- No, no, no, no...
- Yeah!

348
00:19:17.395 --> 00:19:18.770
I saw that. That was cheating.

349
00:19:20.187 --> 00:19:23.228
Do you know where the vet's are?
'Cause I got two swans that are sick.

350
00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:34.062
Never have I ever had sex.

351
00:19:34.562 --> 00:19:36.687
Fucking hell!
Come off it, we're not 12.

352
00:19:39.895 --> 00:19:42.728
[Badger whispers] Never have I ever slept
with two birds in one night.

353
00:19:43.062 --> 00:19:45.437
I'm not drinking that
'cause I'm a fucking saint.

354
00:19:47.187 --> 00:19:48.187
- [Em] Oi.
- Chill out.

355
00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.270
What happens on holiday
stays on holiday!

356
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.353
- What are you doing?
- I was only joking, babe.

357
00:19:56.478 --> 00:19:58.228
I wasn't going to call you out, obviously.

358
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.395
Yeah, sure!

359
00:19:59.437 --> 00:20:01.895
No one cares if you're a virgin,
it's very chill.

360
00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:04.437
So, why are you bringing it up, then?

361
00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:07.312
'Cause it's funny.

362
00:20:08.395 --> 00:20:09.937
[Tara laughs] It's not funny.

363
00:20:09.978 --> 00:20:12.228
Skye, it's not funny.

364
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.853
Got a drink?

365
00:20:14.645 --> 00:20:16.770
Paddy is fit, though!

366
00:20:17.187 --> 00:20:18.853
You should try it with him.

367
00:20:19.562 --> 00:20:20.895
Or I might.

368
00:20:20.978 --> 00:20:22.062
Oh!

369
00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:24.978
[Door shuts]

370
00:20:25.603 --> 00:20:26.603
[Skye] Oi!

371
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.020
Whoo!

372
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.187
Oi, matchy-matchy, night bossman.

373
00:20:49.728 --> 00:20:52.437
[Paddy] Top graft on these lot,
they're about as cool as your sister.

374
00:20:52.478 --> 00:20:54.270
[Badger] Chill out, mush,
we're on holiday!

375
00:20:54.312 --> 00:20:55.312
[Em] What's the matter?

376
00:20:55.353 --> 00:20:57.187
[Tara] Did you hear?
They're talking about us.

377
00:20:57.228 --> 00:20:59.145
We need to, like,
not let on our age at all.

378
00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:00.687
- To them.
- Yeah.

379
00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:03.353
Ooh, I miss my BMW so much!

380
00:21:03.853 --> 00:21:05.270
Subtle!

381
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.770
Listen. Listen.

382
00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:09.687
Do you think Paige is gay?

383
00:21:10.103 --> 00:21:11.603
Are you joking?

384
00:21:12.728 --> 00:21:14.728
- J... I don't know.
- Are you joking?

385
00:21:14.812 --> 00:21:16.728
- Are you telling a joke?
- Let's hope she's gay.

386
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:18.145
[Tara] Of course she's gay.

387
00:21:19.353 --> 00:21:20.562
[All] Oooh!

388
00:21:20.687 --> 00:21:22.520
[Dance music]

389
00:21:23.062 --> 00:21:24.228
[Badger] I saved that!

390
00:21:24.853 --> 00:21:27.228
- Tipped it straight over.
- Don't lie. That went right in.

391
00:21:27.895 --> 00:21:29.812
- Fuck off!
- [Em] That's cheating.

392
00:21:29.978 --> 00:21:32.228
- Right, come on.
- Look at you sat down.

393
00:21:32.478 --> 00:21:33.728
- Come on.
- [Skye] No!

394
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:34.895
What the fuck!

395
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.228
[Em] Let's go.

396
00:21:36.687 --> 00:21:38.020
[They cheer]

397
00:21:45.728 --> 00:21:47.187
Come on, get it down you.

398
00:21:47.228 --> 00:21:48.603
[Paige] Come on Badger.

399
00:21:48.812 --> 00:21:51.312
[Loud dance music;
They chant]

400
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.978
[All] Uh, ah, Malia!

401
00:22:19.812 --> 00:22:21.770
[Tara] Oi! Paddy! Move.

402
00:22:34.478 --> 00:22:36.520
I'm in a bad way!

403
00:22:39.437 --> 00:22:40.895
...two, three!

404
00:22:43.312 --> 00:22:44.937
Feeling any better?

405
00:22:45.687 --> 00:22:47.187
No.

406
00:22:48.228 --> 00:22:49.520
I think I can help.

407
00:22:49.562 --> 00:22:51.103
Um...

408
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.020
So, I sold my hoover
the other day, yeah?

409
00:22:54.312 --> 00:22:55.312
Yeah.

410
00:22:55.437 --> 00:22:58.062
'Cause all it was doing
was collecting dust.

411
00:23:02.103 --> 00:23:05.437
Think! I got more, I got more.

412
00:23:05.562 --> 00:23:10.770
What is the difference
between a plum and a rabbit?

413
00:23:12.353 --> 00:23:13.812
I don't know.

414
00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:17.645
One is purple, and one isn't...

415
00:23:17.728 --> 00:23:19.978
- Oh, wait! No, I got it wrong.
- Oh!

416
00:23:20.145 --> 00:23:22.062
I got it wrong.

417
00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:24.603
No, no, no...

418
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.437
- [He retches]
- You're good.

419
00:23:26.562 --> 00:23:28.978
I don't think you've got
anything else left, to be honest.

420
00:23:34.353 --> 00:23:38.353
Why... Why do you never see
pigs hiding in trees?

421
00:23:40.895 --> 00:23:42.978
'Cause they're pretty good at it.

422
00:23:43.562 --> 00:23:45.562
[He breathes heavily]

423
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.520
[Door opens]

424
00:23:56.103 --> 00:23:58.103
[Birdsong]

425
00:24:27.853 --> 00:24:29.478
Oi, what's that?

426
00:24:30.645 --> 00:24:33.687
Nah! Nah...!
You little cheating bastard.

427
00:24:33.853 --> 00:24:37.395
No, that's a classic one.
I'm going, I'm going.

428
00:24:41.478 --> 00:24:42.770
Shh...

429
00:24:55.562 --> 00:24:56.812
Nah.

430
00:24:57.645 --> 00:24:58.978
Bedtime.

431
00:25:27.437 --> 00:25:30.228
[Boy knocks] Come on, girls.
Up you get, you beautiful lot.

432
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.687
- Buses for Crush in five. Let's go.
- [Dance music outside]

433
00:25:32.728 --> 00:25:34.603
Oi! Hurry up! Crush is happening!

434
00:25:34.812 --> 00:25:35.895
[Boy] Let's go!

435
00:25:35.937 --> 00:25:38.103
[Paige] See you at gate in five!

436
00:25:38.395 --> 00:25:39.687
No.

437
00:25:39.812 --> 00:25:41.645
Surely, we have more
than five minutes, no?

438
00:25:41.978 --> 00:25:43.687
[Em] Why are we doing this to ourselves?

439
00:25:43.728 --> 00:25:46.353
[Skye] No, if it's started,
we got to get a move on.

440
00:25:46.478 --> 00:25:48.645
[Em] We can be a bit late.

441
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.770
[Em grunts]

442
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.062
[Skye] Oh, my God.

443
00:25:53.103 --> 00:25:55.062
- Come on.
- [Skye] Look at the state of him.

444
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.937
[Paddy] See you in a bit, yeah?
Come Badger.

445
00:26:06.645 --> 00:26:08.145
[Skye] I didn't bring any.

446
00:26:08.187 --> 00:26:10.062
Oi! Put this on.

447
00:26:11.562 --> 00:26:13.187
What did he just say?

448
00:26:13.228 --> 00:26:15.103
He's so fit.

449
00:26:18.187 --> 00:26:19.770
Everything hurts.

450
00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:23.603
I think that with this...

451
00:26:23.728 --> 00:26:26.312
- Skye, how does this work?
- Underneath.

452
00:26:26.437 --> 00:26:28.228
You need to cover your bits.

453
00:26:30.478 --> 00:26:33.770
I swear to God,
you guys need to get some life!

454
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.353
The only way through this for me
is with another drink.

455
00:26:38.478 --> 00:26:41.228
- No!
- What's that called? Dog of hair?

456
00:26:41.353 --> 00:26:43.228
- Dog of hair!
- Hair of dog.

457
00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:46.228
- That's a thing.
- Yeah, my mum does it all the time.

458
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.062
See? It's proper.

459
00:26:48.187 --> 00:26:50.437
I'm not fucking dressing you.
I'm not your mum.

460
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.437
- Thanks, mum.
- Where's the hair straighteners?

461
00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.103
No, wait, Skye,
I need something else on with it.

462
00:26:55.228 --> 00:26:56.853
- What? What?
- It's see-through.

463
00:26:56.978 --> 00:26:58.228
It's not that see-through!

464
00:26:58.353 --> 00:27:00.937
In the water it will be.
I thought this is a pool party.

465
00:27:01.187 --> 00:27:04.020
[Boy on mic, over loud music] Right
come on orange! Come on, that's it.

466
00:27:04.103 --> 00:27:07.395
[Girl yells] Come on, girls!
Let's get it down you!

467
00:27:07.728 --> 00:27:09.645
Use those double-Ds!

468
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:12.353
How are they not choking on that?

469
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.520
That's it, girls!
Double-Ds, babes!

470
00:27:17.312 --> 00:27:18.937
We have a winner!
Well done, babes.

471
00:27:19.103 --> 00:27:20.687
Well done Sir, that's fantastic.

472
00:27:20.978 --> 00:27:22.270
One more girl! Anyone!

473
00:27:23.187 --> 00:27:25.770
- Taz! Taz!
- No, Skye.

474
00:27:25.895 --> 00:27:27.270
We've got one here! Taz!

475
00:27:29.062 --> 00:27:30.603
[Girl] In the green, yeah? Come on!

476
00:27:30.728 --> 00:27:33.395
Come on, baby girl,
you got this one, you got this!

477
00:27:33.478 --> 00:27:36.645
[Boy] One brave boy to play the game.

478
00:27:36.853 --> 00:27:39.312
Hey, here we go.
Look at him, he's eager.

479
00:27:39.437 --> 00:27:41.228
- You all right, bruv? Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

480
00:27:41.353 --> 00:27:43.228
Right, up there you pop.
Go on, son.

481
00:27:43.437 --> 00:27:45.895
Go on, Taz. Whoo!

482
00:27:46.687 --> 00:27:48.187
- Oh!
- Hello, little flower.

483
00:27:48.312 --> 00:27:49.395
How are you?

484
00:27:49.478 --> 00:27:50.603
- You okay?
- Yeah.

485
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.895
- Who've we got?
- I'm Tara.

486
00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.270
Hello, Tara!

487
00:27:54.437 --> 00:27:55.978
You know what this kind of game is?

488
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.645
- I guess so.
- It's a bit naughty. Are you sure?

489
00:27:58.687 --> 00:28:01.228
All right, he's got a big fake willy,
that looks like a beer,

490
00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:02.895
and you're going to drink it.

491
00:28:03.062 --> 00:28:04.187
[Girl] Right, ready?

492
00:28:04.228 --> 00:28:07.395
Beer in the mouth, blowjob-style.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

493
00:28:08.312 --> 00:28:11.728
That's it, that's it!
Go on, get back in there!

494
00:28:12.187 --> 00:28:13.603
That's it! Not in her eyes.

495
00:28:14.645 --> 00:28:17.437
That's it. More, more, more, more.
Go on, keep going. Push it. Push it!

496
00:28:17.687 --> 00:28:20.603
Put your back into it, mate.
That's it, that's it, that's it!

497
00:28:20.812 --> 00:28:22.270
Keep going, keep going!

498
00:28:22.395 --> 00:28:24.937
Get in there!
That's it, that's it, that's it!

499
00:28:25.103 --> 00:28:28.103
Come on, open your mouth more,
Jesus Christ!

500
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.270
No boy's going to be happy with you!

501
00:28:30.395 --> 00:28:31.853
Christ!

502
00:28:32.103 --> 00:28:33.395
Tragic. I love you though.

503
00:28:33.728 --> 00:28:35.687
Yeah, I'm not good at that game.

504
00:28:35.812 --> 00:28:37.437
I dunno, you look pretty good to me.

505
00:28:37.562 --> 00:28:39.937
- [Girl] Come on, guys! All right!
- [Boy] Another one?

506
00:28:40.062 --> 00:28:41.645
- That's enough.
- That's enough.

507
00:28:41.728 --> 00:28:43.103
Off, off! You lost.

508
00:28:43.895 --> 00:28:45.437
[Boy] You lost, girl!

509
00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.353
[Girl on mic] You can cuddle
in your own time.

510
00:28:47.395 --> 00:28:50.020
- [Boy] Right, we need another boy!
- [Girl] One more boy, please.

511
00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:52.228
[Loud dance music]

512
00:28:52.353 --> 00:28:54.020
[Girl] Come on!

Going down t' beach?
Everyone's there.

[She sniffles]

1045
01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.062
Do you want a drink?

01:07:56.353 --> 01:07:57.353
Cuppa?

1047
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:02.812
[Tara] Yeah, sure.

1048
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:09.103
What would you rather be,
a baby goat or a mata baby?

1049
01:08:10.978 --> 01:08:12.853
What's a mata baby?

1050
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.562
I don't know baby,
what's the matter with you?

1051
01:08:17.645 --> 01:08:19.645
[She chuckles]

1052
01:08:24.937 --> 01:08:26.770
Do you want any sugar?

1053
01:08:27.352 --> 01:08:28.895
[Tara] Uh-huh.

1054
01:08:40.312 --> 01:08:42.602

- We didn't come here to sleep.

1064
01:11:26.062 --> 01:11:27.562
We bought you a present.

1065
01:11:28.478 --> 01:11:30.353
- [Paige] Got a dead weight!
- Sort her out.

1066
01:11:30.728 --> 01:11:32.853
Wake up, you lazybones.

Hi.

I just came to say hi.

1077

Hi.

1078

What are you doing?

1079

Sleeping here.

1080
01:12:44.145 --> 01:12:45.770
Did you not like it?

1081
01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:54.937
[Badger] Yo, I've got a drink
for you here, bro.

1082
01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:56.812
I'm all right, me, bro.

1083
01:12:57.437 --> 01:13:00.562
I'm good. I'm going to go to bed, me,
I'm pretty tired.

1084
01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.312
I'm a taken man now, aren't I?

1085

[Door closes]

1086
01:13:22.895 --> 01:13:24.728
What are you wearing?

1087
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.895
Get these off you, you'll be red hot.

1088
01:13:44.728 --> 01:13:46.228
[She grunts]

1089
01:13:46.812 --> 01:13:48.520
Everyone's here, Paddy,
and I'm asleep.

1090
01:13:48.562 --> 01:13:50.228
All right, all right.

1091

<i>Love you.</i>

1095

I love you, too, mate.

<i>Are we still going to hang out?</i>

1102
01:14:23.478 --> 01:14:25.145
Yeah, mate, we will.

1103

<i>We'll be best friends for life.</i>

1104
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:30.353
[Tara] Hm.

1105
01:14:31.978 --> 01:14:33.770
[He sighs]

1106
01:14:39.812 --> 01:14:41.812
[Paddy breathes heavily]

1107
01:14:53.562 --> 01:14:55.687
Don't move. Let me do it.

1108
01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:02.187
Am I too fast?

1109
01:15:02.562 --> 01:15:04.353
You like it fast, don't you?

1110
01:15:04.853 --> 01:15:06.520
[Badger]<i> My neck is killing me...</i>

1111
01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:08.562

[Door opens]

1113
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:16.020
[Badger] That floor is fucking rough,
mate, my neck's fucked.

1114

[Skye sighs]

1115
01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:26.645
[Skye whispers] Told you you would.

1116
01:15:28.978 --> 01:15:30.728
I love you, mate.

1117
01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.437
Best holiday ever.

1118
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.270
[Low, abrupt hum]

1119
01:16:34.603 --> 01:16:36.562
Probably won't go out tonight.

1120
01:16:40.645 --> 01:16:42.645
Went a bit hard, innit?

1121
01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.687
You can't pretend you can't hear me.

1122
01:16:59.187 --> 01:17:01.020
I made it onto your balcony now.

1123
01:17:02.312 --> 01:17:04.228
Yeah, sorry, I'm just tired.

1124
01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:10.228

Mission complete! On t' next one!

1126

Fucking what round is it?

1128
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.603
Morning, gorgeous. All right?

1129
01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:27.145
What you saying?

1130
01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.270
Nothing, I'm chilling, bro.

1131
01:17:34.145 --> 01:17:36.020
Fucking hell! Good chat lads!

1132
01:17:51.353 --> 01:17:53.395
[Badger] He's a nightmare of a guy.

1133
01:17:55.312 --> 01:17:56.687
Mm...

1134
01:18:06.145 --> 01:18:07.853
I've known him since I were little.

1135
01:18:09.812 --> 01:18:13.062
His mum and my mum,
they're best mates.

1136
01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:22.145
And we live on the same street.

1137
01:18:24.187 --> 01:18:25.812
That's nice.

1138
01:18:50.312 --> 01:18:51.687

[Paige] Anyway, we're all

[Paddy] Yeah, no excuses.

1145
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:04.812
No early bedtimes either, Taz.

1146
01:19:04.937 --> 01:19:06.187
[Skye] Call her, then, innit.

1147
01:19:06.228 --> 01:19:07.937
[Paige] Make sure you text me
when you get home.

1148

Uh, I'm going to get

What do youse want?

1156
01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:29.437
- Chips if they have them.
- Yeah, chips also.

1157
01:21:30.562 --> 01:21:31.853
Banging.

1158
01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:37.145
Give us all the details then.

1159
01:21:37.562 --> 01:21:39.687
There's not really anything to add to it.

1160
01:21:44.062 --> 01:21:46.228
I reckon we'll come back next year.

1161
01:21:52.312 --> 01:21:54.312
Oi, you did it again last night, innit?

1162

[Tara grunts]

1163
01:22:00.062 --> 01:22:01.562
I swear!

1164
01:22:03.145 --> 01:22:05.937
Oh, was it better
the second time, yeah?

1165
01:22:12.478 --> 01:22:14.603
Why are you being sheepish?

1166
01:22:14.728 --> 01:22:16.478
Come on, give us the details.

1167
01:22:16.687 --> 01:22:18.062
No.

1168
01:22:18.228 --> 01:22:20.437
It didn't count.
It weren't really proper.

1169
01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.103
- [Skye] How can it not be proper?
- Here.

1170
01:22:25.645 --> 01:22:26.853
What are you pair saying?

1171
01:22:26.978 --> 01:22:28.853
Just saying about last night.

1172
01:22:28.937 --> 01:22:30.853
Taz is saying it didn't count.

1173
01:22:32.395 --> 01:22:33.687
He's fit.

1174
01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.187
In my opinion, anyway.

1175
01:22:36.062 --> 01:22:37.353
I would have.

1176
01:22:39.728 --> 01:22:41.145
Yeah, he is fit.

1177
01:22:41.645 --> 01:22:43.978
Who'd have thought
you two would get laid the most?

1178
01:22:47.978 --> 01:22:49.728
Yeah, I don't know, he's just...

1179
01:22:50.228 --> 01:22:51.687
a weird guy, innit?

1180
01:22:52.062 --> 01:22:53.728
What do you mean,
he's a weird guy?

1181
01:22:53.812 --> 01:22:55.062
[Skye] Forget him!

1182
01:22:56.395 --> 01:22:58.687
We're going out
as soon as we get home, yeah?

1183

Huh! Fuck Paddy, man!

1185
01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.895
You can do so much better.

1186
01:23:14.937 --> 01:23:16.353
Taz?

1187
01:23:21.145 --> 01:23:22.520
I like, I was...

1188
01:23:25.145 --> 01:23:26.687
asleep, so...

1189
01:23:33.103 --> 01:23:34.520
Are you saying...?

1190
01:23:38.312 --> 01:23:40.687
What, Taz, was he like that
with you both nights?

1191
01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.562
It's fine.

1192
01:23:58.562 --> 01:24:00.270
You should've said something, like.

1193
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:02.312
I didn't clock, I...

1194
01:24:05.062 --> 01:24:06.395
Taz...

1195
01:24:07.395 --> 01:24:09.937
No, you're right, I should've,
I should've said something.

1196
01:24:12.103 --> 01:24:13.353
It's fine.

1197
01:24:18.812 --> 01:24:20.020
No, it's not.

1198
01:24:20.645 --> 01:24:23.062
[Skye] We should buy stuff here.
It's much cheaper.

1199
01:24:23.437 --> 01:24:26.020
I didn't even get a tattoo
or anything on this holiday.

1200
01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:28.645
[Skye] You were busy.

1201
01:24:32.562 --> 01:24:34.145
Oi, smell that.

1202
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.562
- It's banging, that.
- [Em] Mm.

- [Woman on PA]<i> ...to London, Luton.
</i>- Yeah.

1204
01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:41.978
Fuck! You guys know
this is our plane boarding, innit?

1205
01:24:42.687 --> 01:24:43.728
