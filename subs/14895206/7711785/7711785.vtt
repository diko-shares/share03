1
00:02:15.273 --> 00:02:17.309
Give it up, Frank!

2
00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:38.463
Joe Cribbens.

3
00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.502
Joe Cribbens! Visitor!

4
00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:50.810
Well, goddamn. Hard to figure
who I'd less rather see.

5
00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:54.514
What brings a skunk
like you here?

6
00:02:54.547 --> 00:02:57.717
I was in the neighborhood
collecting reward money.

7
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.484
Thought I'd pay you a visit.

8
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.288
Yeah. Heard you took down
Frank Ledbetter last week.

9
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:07.292
We get all the news in here.
You'd be surprised.

10
00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:10.897
How much you gonna collect
for old Frank?

11
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.266
- Friend of yours?
- Never met the man,

12
00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.902
but I was on his side.

13
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:21.908
Okay, bounty man. Did you give
him much of a chance?

14
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.810
Same chance he gave me.

15
00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.748
Give it up, Frank!

16
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.755
Right. Just another fella
dead for a dollar.

17
00:03:35.788 --> 00:03:39.859
I figure you know I'm getting
out of here next week.

18
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.429
Served my time. All five years.

19
00:03:44.463 --> 00:03:46.264
I heard you've been
telling people

20
00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:48.266
first thing you were gonna do
when you walk out of here

21
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.636
is get a gun and look me up.

22
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.471
Don't flatter yourself.

23
00:03:52.504 --> 00:03:54.674
I'm not going out of my way
to find you.

24
00:03:55.742 --> 00:03:58.376
I'm going to head down
to Mexico.

25
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.681
Just... play out the string.

26
00:04:01.714 --> 00:04:04.784
Cards, tequila, seÃ±oritas...

27
00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:06.886
No matter where you're headed,

28
00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.757
you'll still end up the same.
Horse thief.

29
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:14.527
- Guilty.
- Bank robber.

30
00:04:15.027 --> 00:04:17.797
- Couldn't prove it.
- Killed a couple of men.

31
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.800
Couldn't prove it,
and I never killed nobody

32
00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:23.301
that wasn't trying to kill me.

33
00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:34.747
When you took me down,
I was sleeping.

34
00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:37.650
It wasn't a real fight.

35
00:04:37.683 --> 00:04:41.353
I just... woke up with a gun
in my face.

36
00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:43.022
Stay clear of me, Joe.

37
00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:45.725
You do the same!

38
00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.530
Otherwise, most likely,
you're a dead man.

39
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:56.401
I don't usually tell a man
twice. Stay clear of me, Joe.

40
00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:04.510
Shit heel.

41
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.704
Prisoner number 387,
Joe Cribbens.

42
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.776
Your paperwork came
in the afternoon mail.

43
00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:38.778
Tomorrow morning 10 o'clock,

44
00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:40.847
you get your possessions back
and a government check

45
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.950
for 50 dollars.
Good luck to you, Joe.

46
00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:45.417
Yes, sir.

47
00:05:46.752 --> 00:05:47.920
Yip!

48
00:06:11.944 --> 00:06:13.679
Take a last look.

49
00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.572
Captain Brand.
Rider approaching, sir.

50
00:06:48.114 --> 00:06:50.883
Good morning.
Let me take care of your horse.

51
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.692
Max Borlund, follow us.

52
00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:10.970
Sir. Mr. Borlund, sir.

53
00:07:11.003 --> 00:07:12.705
As you were, corporal.

54
00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:19.612
Mr. Borlund. It's good
to see you again.

55
00:07:19.645 --> 00:07:21.914
It's been some time.
- It has.

56
00:07:21.948 --> 00:07:25.483
This is Martin Kidd. He could
stand to use your services.

57
00:07:25.518 --> 00:07:27.787
Mr. Kidd is a prominent
businessman here

58
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.189
in the territory,
and a friend to the army.

59
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:34.994
Mr. Borlund, it seems your
reputation precedes you.

60
00:07:35.027 --> 00:07:36.796
I'll accept that
as a compliment.

61
00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:38.931
Gentlemen, this is
a clandestine moment

62
00:07:38.965 --> 00:07:41.534
and a meeting
that never happened.

63
00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:44.236
That's why I've convened it out
here in the middle of nowhere.

64
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.806
I'll let you two
get down to business.

65
00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:50.776
Um, Mr. Borlund, I doubt
that you're familiar

66
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.012
with a Buffalo soldier
by the name of Elijah Jones?

67
00:07:53.045 --> 00:07:54.847
Private Elijah Jones? No?

68
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.184
<i>Right, he's taken a white woman,
my wife, Rachel.</i>

69
00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:00.720
<i>Abducted her three weeks ago,</i>

70
00:08:00.753 --> 00:08:03.089
<i>took her across the border
down to Mexico.</i>

71
00:08:03.122 --> 00:08:06.258
<i>I sent out patrols,
thought we could head 'em off,</i>

72
00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:09.562
find 'em before they got
to the border. We missed 'em.

73
00:08:09.595 --> 00:08:11.998
Alright, so, son of a bitch
is asking for $10,000

74
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:13.866
in ransom money,
which I will not pay.

75
00:08:13.899 --> 00:08:17.570
I do not reward criminals,
but I am willing to offer you

76
00:08:17.603 --> 00:08:21.941
$2,000 to bring Rachel back.
$500 advance.

77
00:08:27.246 --> 00:08:30.583
This will help you
identify Rachel.

78
00:08:30.616 --> 00:08:33.552
Captain Brand there
has a document stating

79
00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:36.088
that you are a representative
of the United States government

80
00:08:36.122 --> 00:08:38.591
and you're in pursuit of Elijah,
in case you run into any

81
00:08:38.624 --> 00:08:41.093
legal problems down in Mexico.

82
00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:43.529
Well, three weeks head start...

83
00:08:44.296 --> 00:08:47.933
I need supplies, a pack mule,
ammunition.

84
00:08:47.967 --> 00:08:51.337
Discretion in this matter,
that's of paramount importance.

85
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.306
It's my wife's reputation
to consider.

86
00:08:55.341 --> 00:08:57.276
As well as my own.

87
00:08:57.309 --> 00:08:58.644
Sergeant Poe!

88
00:08:59.912 --> 00:09:02.281
Off the books, we're sending
one soldier to accompany you.

89
00:09:04.383 --> 00:09:08.154
Sir! Mr. Borlund,
as ordered by the captain,

90
00:09:08.187 --> 00:09:10.689
Sergeant Alonzo Poe
reporting for duty, sir!

91
00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:14.593
Make sure he dresses civilian.

92
00:09:14.627 --> 00:09:16.629
Things need to look proper.

93
00:09:16.662 --> 00:09:18.197
Don't want you two
to travel together

94
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.832
until you're both south
of the border.

95
00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:22.334
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Sir, yes, sir!

96
00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:41.787
Well, well. Here comes
the bounty man.

97
00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:44.957
Captain say he the best shooter
in the territory,

98
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.592
rifle or pistol.

99
00:09:59.138 --> 00:10:00.306
Sergeant Poe.

100
00:10:01.373 --> 00:10:02.374
Mr. Borlund, sir.

101
00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:06.011
The captain tells me
you're gonna be a very

102
00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:07.847
valuable man on this trip.

103
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.915
I just want to say
if things get tight,

104
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:12.418
I'm a damn good shot.
Best eye in the regiment.

105
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:14.987
Captain also says

106
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.724
you have an idea where Mrs. Kidd
and this Elijah Jones may be.

107
00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:21.827
Oh, I know exactly where.
Got the map right here.

108
00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:24.163
Can't do much better than that,

109
00:10:24.196 --> 00:10:25.364
now can you?

110
00:10:25.397 --> 00:10:27.066
Shows you right to where
they're hiding out.

111
00:10:27.099 --> 00:10:28.334
Now, this here map
was given to me

112
00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:29.869
by Private Elijah Jones himself.

113
00:10:29.902 --> 00:10:31.437
Private Jones
just hands out maps

114
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:33.806
of where he's gonna be
after he deserts the army

115
00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:36.342
and abducts a white woman?
Let me see this map.

116
00:10:46.318 --> 00:10:49.855
According to this,
they're deep into Chihuahua.

117
00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:51.957
Mm-hmm.
That sounds about right.

118
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:53.926
Elijah said it was a fair piece.

119
00:10:54.827 --> 00:10:58.197
Look, normally we'd head
straight to San Juanito.

120
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.999
It's the best road south.

121
00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:03.769
Start asking if anyone's seen
a Black man travelling

122
00:11:03.802 --> 00:11:06.071
with a white woman,
but if he abducted her,

123
00:11:06.105 --> 00:11:08.174
he'd avoid showing up in cities.

124
00:11:08.207 --> 00:11:12.344
No. He run off,
damn foolish. But...

125
00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:15.948
Well, Elijah didn't
abduct nobody.

126
00:11:17.316 --> 00:11:18.951
That's not what I've been told.

127
00:11:20.252 --> 00:11:21.887
Let me tell you about Elijah.

128
00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:26.058
Like all of God's children,
he's got his faults.

129
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:28.093
But in a lot of ways,
he's a really good fella.

130
00:11:30.196 --> 00:11:33.766
I know these is delicate
matters, but I gotta say,

131
00:11:33.799 --> 00:11:36.302
if she's with Elijah,
it's 'cause she wanna be.

132
00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:38.804
Sounds like
you're defending him.

133
00:11:40.472 --> 00:11:42.208
Private Elijah Jones
was expecting me

134
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:45.077
to join up with him. Gave me
the map so I could find the way.

135
00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:48.981
Now I'm the one who's supposed
to deliver the ransom money.

136
00:11:49.014 --> 00:11:52.084
That's why I truly do believe
they are holed up

137
00:11:52.117 --> 00:11:54.987
in the middle of nowhere
at an American fella's place,

138
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.422
named Hannon.

139
00:11:56.455 --> 00:12:00.025
There's a Hannon
that's a wanted man in Texas.

140
00:12:00.059 --> 00:12:02.127
The poster's been up
for five years.

141
00:12:02.161 --> 00:12:05.397
Accomplice to murder.
Bank robbery in El Paso.

142
00:12:06.832 --> 00:12:08.200
- Do you know this woman?
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:12:08.234 --> 00:12:09.536
Ain't never met her.

144
00:12:09.569 --> 00:12:12.171
She helped improve Elijah's
reading in the school.

145
00:12:12.204 --> 00:12:13.839
At least that's what he told me.

146
00:12:14.807 --> 00:12:18.110
Yeah, is this the face that
launched a thousand ships?

147
00:12:19.278 --> 00:12:21.213
You wanna run that by me
one more time?

148
00:12:21.847 --> 00:12:24.216
Ah, it's a line by Marlowe,
Shakespeare's time,

149
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.118
you know, about Helen of Troy.

150
00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:28.153
All right, right, right, I was
just reading all about that

151
00:12:28.187 --> 00:12:29.221
just the other day.

152
00:12:30.022 --> 00:12:32.324
- You trust that map?
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:12:33.425 --> 00:12:34.860
And they're holed up down there

154
00:12:34.893 --> 00:12:36.328
waiting for the money
that I ain't bringing.

155
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.935
Ooh! Yes, sir! I guess you wanna
know my story too, huh?

156
00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:45.170
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, come on, now, Mr. Borlund.

157
00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:47.006
A little friendly talk
to help the time pass by.

158
00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:48.173
Ain't that true?

159
00:12:48.207 --> 00:12:49.975
- Thanks.
- You want me to call you Max?

160
00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:56.482
I think Mr. Borlund
will do just fine.

161
00:12:57.349 --> 00:12:59.118
Mr. Borlund it is.

162
00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:01.320
See now, the thing with Elijah
here is real simple.

163
00:13:01.987 --> 00:13:03.222
He wasn't an army man.

164
00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:06.358
See, where I come from,
a new bed,

165
00:13:06.392 --> 00:13:09.828
clean clothes, a good horse,
and three square meals a day

166
00:13:09.862 --> 00:13:11.363
sounded like a mighty fine deal.

167
00:13:11.397 --> 00:13:13.533
I joined up in the army
when I was 17.

168
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.436
The captain, he filled me in
about you too now, sir.

169
00:13:17.469 --> 00:13:21.173
Captain say you either a
Dutchman, or a Swede, or a...

170
00:13:21.206 --> 00:13:22.609
a German or something such.

171
00:13:22.642 --> 00:13:25.077
Captain say you used to be
a soldier some time way back.

172
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:26.579
Ain't too sure about
which army, though.

173
00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:28.615
- Mm-hmm.
- Mind telling me?

174
00:13:28.648 --> 00:13:32.251
Is you a Dutchman or a Swede?
Whatever?

175
00:13:32.284 --> 00:13:34.853
Not at all. I'm an American.

176
00:13:54.239 --> 00:13:55.508
You know, uh...

177
00:13:57.109 --> 00:13:59.244
You've been acting real jumpy
the last few days.

178
00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:04.517
I've come to realize...

179
00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:09.188
...my whole life, I've done
impulsive things.

180
00:14:11.524 --> 00:14:13.992
They don't always work out.

181
00:14:15.994 --> 00:14:18.130
Got a reserve of 20 bullets.

182
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:21.100
I'm gonna use another five
to practice.

183
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.537
I keep being told this is
a dangerous country.

184
00:14:36.716 --> 00:14:39.985
I'll never give them the
pleasure of watching me cry.

185
00:14:40.219 --> 00:14:43.590
Good. Yeah, I like that.

186
00:14:44.524 --> 00:14:46.291
We did what we done.

187
00:14:46.325 --> 00:14:48.961
And we just saying
to all of them,

188
00:14:48.994 --> 00:14:50.429
"Piss upon ya.

189
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:53.165
Go straight to hell."

190
00:15:08.113 --> 00:15:11.618
I was sent here by Tiberio
because my English is good.

191
00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:13.485
Very good, as you can tell.

192
00:15:14.219 --> 00:15:18.390
Let me begin saying I am honored
to meet you, Mrs. Kidd.

193
00:15:18.424 --> 00:15:21.460
Obviously, a very kind and
beautiful woman.

194
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:25.264
I say thank you, Mr. Romero.

195
00:15:25.297 --> 00:15:27.232
But maybe you should get
to the point.

196
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.268
Why are you here?

197
00:15:29.669 --> 00:15:32.404
Oh. I'm here to represent
Tiberio Vargas,

198
00:15:32.438 --> 00:15:35.441
and to give response
to the financial offer

199
00:15:35.474 --> 00:15:37.443
made to him by SeÃ±or Hannon.

200
00:15:37.476 --> 00:15:39.111
Let us review the facts.

201
00:15:39.144 --> 00:15:41.346
We don't have to do
this business here and now,

202
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:42.682
in front of these people.

203
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.685
Mr. Hannon owes Tiberio Vargas

204
00:15:45.718 --> 00:15:47.587
several thousand dollars
in gambling debt.

205
00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.157
Hold on, goddamn it!
This is between me and Tiberio.

206
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:56.261
To retire the debt, Mr. Hannon
has offered Tiberio Vargas

207
00:15:56.295 --> 00:15:59.732
$5,000 of Mrs. Kidd's
ransom money,

208
00:15:59.766 --> 00:16:03.135
in return for your safe passage
to Veracruz and then Cuba.

209
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.439
Goddamn it. You son
of a bitch, you sold us out.

210
00:16:08.708 --> 00:16:10.008
All right...

211
00:16:10.743 --> 00:16:12.411
I needed money.

212
00:16:12.444 --> 00:16:16.616
The two of you, you eat up
my food, sleep all hours.

213
00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:18.450
You don't pay shit for rent.

214
00:16:19.218 --> 00:16:23.756
And worst of all, I gotta deal
with this hell cat of yours

215
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:26.726
complaining all the time
about how dirty it is

216
00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:31.263
for her dainty self and that I
live like a goddamn bindlestiff!

217
00:16:31.296 --> 00:16:33.666
I don't see why I gotta
put up with this shit

218
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.735
from this rich bitch whore

219
00:16:35.768 --> 00:16:37.604
without getting paid
royal for it!

220
00:16:45.477 --> 00:16:48.815
I've decided...
the price for room and board

221
00:16:48.848 --> 00:16:52.451
for these two runaways
is $2,500.

222
00:16:53.285 --> 00:16:56.455
Everybody in this deal
is guaranteed something.

223
00:16:56.856 --> 00:16:58.457
Everybody benefits.

224
00:16:59.358 --> 00:17:01.594
I'll tell you about guarantees.

225
00:17:01.628 --> 00:17:03.228
I'll guarantee you this.

226
00:17:03.796 --> 00:17:06.599
I am not a whore.

227
00:17:27.854 --> 00:17:32.224
A message is sent
to Tiberio by SeÃ±or Hannon.

228
00:17:32.592 --> 00:17:35.828
His offer proposes that Tiberio,
for $5,000,

229
00:17:35.862 --> 00:17:40.567
will guarantee safe conduct for
you and Mrs. Kidd to Veracruz.

230
00:17:41.634 --> 00:17:43.636
I have come here to
tell you that

231
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.506
Tiberio accepts your proposal.

232
00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:51.744
Maybe this actually works.

233
00:17:52.512 --> 00:17:56.248
Sure, we lose some money, but...
it gets us a clean getaway.

234
00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:27.412
Mr. Borlund.

235
00:18:36.254 --> 00:18:39.157
Outlaws?
- Until proven differently.

236
00:18:59.545 --> 00:19:00.580
Greetings.

237
00:19:01.881 --> 00:19:03.716
This is SeÃ±or Tiberio Vargas,

238
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.418
I am Esteban Romero,
at your service.

239
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:08.253
I will translate.

240
00:19:08.286 --> 00:19:12.190
SeÃ±or Vargas is a very important
and generous man.

241
00:19:12.224 --> 00:19:15.360
Ten years ago, he sent me
to Monterrey to study law.

242
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.810
As you can see,
Tiberio is hunting,

243
00:19:30.843 --> 00:19:32.779
entertaining his guest and
business associate,

244
00:19:32.812 --> 00:19:34.479
SeÃ±or Palmer.

245
00:19:34.514 --> 00:19:37.583
SeÃ±or Palmer has come
all the way from London

246
00:19:37.617 --> 00:19:39.585
to do business with Tiberio.

247
00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:41.888
- Really?
- Uh, Tiberio says

248
00:19:41.921 --> 00:19:43.756
that the land
you're travelling through,

249
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.759
the water you're helping
yourselves to is all his,

250
00:19:46.793 --> 00:19:51.496
and as a result, there is a fee
to be paid for safe passage.

251
00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:56.703
Tiberio is not happy.

252
00:19:56.736 --> 00:19:59.806
He says force
could possibly be used.

253
00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:01.373
He has many guns.

254
00:20:01.741 --> 00:20:04.811
So do we. Tiberio will be
the first one to be shot.

255
00:20:04.844 --> 00:20:07.814
If you allow me, sir,
I don't mean to interfere,

256
00:20:07.847 --> 00:20:10.883
but it might not be wise
to contest this issue.

257
00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:14.286
Now, if you want my opinion...
- I don't.

258
00:20:16.556 --> 00:20:19.424
Mr. Poe!
- That'll be me, sir.

259
00:20:19.458 --> 00:20:21.359
Armed and ready.

260
00:20:24.664 --> 00:20:27.600
Down here,
the gringos are not the boss.

261
00:20:27.633 --> 00:20:30.603
- So you do speak English.
- Only when I want.

262
00:20:42.347 --> 00:20:43.381
Who the hell are you?

263
00:20:44.584 --> 00:20:46.919
I'm the fella with the gun.
Who the hell is you?

264
00:20:46.953 --> 00:20:48.888
I go by Jack Tyree.

265
00:20:48.921 --> 00:20:51.023
Looks like you a long way
from home, Jack.

266
00:20:52.024 --> 00:20:54.026
I'm giving you advice, amigo.

267
00:20:54.994 --> 00:20:59.297
Clear on out of here. Tiberio
don't kill you, I just might.

268
00:20:59.331 --> 00:21:02.334
I don't much like me some damned
smart mouthed fucker.

269
00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:10.308
So, what's it gonna be?

270
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.410
How do you want to play it?

271
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:31.697
Tiberio asks if
you, like so many others,

272
00:21:31.731 --> 00:21:33.566
are here to seek gold.

273
00:21:33.599 --> 00:21:35.467
We all work for money.

274
00:21:43.475 --> 00:21:46.779
Well, sir,
my name is William Palmer.

275
00:21:47.113 --> 00:21:49.381
I just wish to say that
your good fortune matches

276
00:21:49.414 --> 00:21:50.883
your obstinate stupidity.

277
00:21:51.517 --> 00:21:53.485
<i>- Vamos, vamos!</i>
- Good day.

278
00:21:54.386 --> 00:21:55.521
Yah!

279
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.359
You find gold,
you must share it with Tiberio.

280
00:22:01.861 --> 00:22:04.664
Otherwise, I guarantee
the consequences will be

281
00:22:04.697 --> 00:22:06.566
extremely unpleasant.

282
00:22:22.048 --> 00:22:24.382
I don't think we made
a new friend.

283
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.589
Do you wish
for a meal or a room?

284
00:23:03.623 --> 00:23:04.957
I reckon I need both.

285
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:07.159
Ah. How long are you
gonna stay, SeÃ±or?

286
00:23:07.193 --> 00:23:10.529
Ah, a couple of weeks.
Maybe more, <i>quiÃ©n sabe.</i>

287
00:23:10.563 --> 00:23:12.665
Ah, we've got lots of rooms.

288
00:23:15.768 --> 00:23:17.469
I give you the best one.

289
00:23:18.037 --> 00:23:20.172
Looks to be kind of quiet
around here.

290
00:23:20.206 --> 00:23:21.807
You know, we have this town.

291
00:23:21.841 --> 00:23:23.843
People still come here
to gamble.

292
00:23:24.476 --> 00:23:26.612
Tiberio Vargas y <i>sus hombres,</i>

293
00:23:26.646 --> 00:23:28.514
they come here, they gamble.

294
00:23:28.547 --> 00:23:31.183
We still have <i>rucas.</i>
<i>Buenas rucas.</i>

295
00:23:31.217 --> 00:23:34.452
We have the house dealer,
Sylvio, an honest man.

296
00:23:35.087 --> 00:23:37.857
Right now, that's just
what the doctor ordered.

297
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.393
Gonna suit me right down
to the ground.

298
00:23:40.993 --> 00:23:43.529
Joe Cribbens, at your service.

299
00:23:43.562 --> 00:23:46.165
<i>Entonces...</i> What,
you are a businessman?

300
00:23:46.198 --> 00:23:50.903
I retired. I just like
to play cards and...

301
00:23:50.937 --> 00:23:52.605
stay out of trouble.

302
00:24:07.987 --> 00:24:11.724
See them two horses down
there? Them is army horses.

303
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:13.693
The map worked out.

304
00:24:14.593 --> 00:24:16.095
We got 'em, Mr. Borlund.

305
00:24:16.128 --> 00:24:18.064
We got 'em with the element
of surprise.

306
00:24:19.765 --> 00:24:24.070
The map was correct.
Very good, Mr. Poe. Very good.

307
00:24:24.971 --> 00:24:26.539
I aim to please.

308
00:24:58.604 --> 00:25:01.707
Don't seem
to be any luck. Shit.

309
00:25:03.109 --> 00:25:05.177
You got a bad temper, Jack.

310
00:25:06.112 --> 00:25:09.048
The other night,
you were way out of hand.

311
00:25:11.684 --> 00:25:13.252
You ought a get it under control.

312
00:25:14.253 --> 00:25:16.122
I still can't accept...

313
00:25:21.961 --> 00:25:25.131
Elijah, don't!
I wouldn't try anything foolish.

314
00:25:25.164 --> 00:25:26.732
Walk away from that gun.

315
00:25:26.766 --> 00:25:29.068
No, no, no, no!
This ain't part of the deal!

316
00:25:29.101 --> 00:25:30.603
This is my private fucking...

317
00:25:30.636 --> 00:25:33.205
Oh, Mr. Hannon, keep
your arms up and stay quiet!

318
00:25:33.239 --> 00:25:34.807
- Who are you?
- Go easy now, ma'am,

319
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.043
a lot of guns in here.
- Damn you, I asked who are you.

320
00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:38.344
Just what do you think
you're doing?

321
00:25:38.377 --> 00:25:40.046
We're here on full legal
authority, Mrs. Kidd.

322
00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:41.981
That, and me and Elijah here
are old friends.

323
00:25:42.014 --> 00:25:44.850
Alonzo, you done gone over,
you done sold me out?

324
00:25:44.884 --> 00:25:47.753
Yep! Turns out I'm just a good
old army man, ain't that right?

325
00:25:47.787 --> 00:25:49.789
You're the only damn person
in the regiment I trusted!

326
00:25:49.822 --> 00:25:51.957
You let me down, brother!
- You let yourself down

327
00:25:51.991 --> 00:25:54.060
with this dumb-ass plan.
That and getting caught up

328
00:25:54.093 --> 00:25:55.728
with this silly-ass white woman.

329
00:25:56.128 --> 00:25:58.597
One thing is for certain,
I ain't going back to Texas

330
00:25:58.631 --> 00:26:00.299
with some bounty man!

331
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.035
I got a rope waiting for me.

332
00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:05.304
Get the hell gone
or I'll kill her, sure as hell!

333
00:26:05.337 --> 00:26:07.139
He's not after you,
he's after us.

334
00:26:07.173 --> 00:26:08.340
- Bullshit!
- Goddamn...

335
00:26:23.422 --> 00:26:24.690
You killed him.

336
00:26:25.024 --> 00:26:26.125
Yes, I did.

337
00:26:27.159 --> 00:26:29.261
You're gonna bury him,
Mr. Jones.

338
00:26:31.664 --> 00:26:33.833
Max Borlund. Ma'am.

339
00:26:35.167 --> 00:26:37.937
I've been hired by your husband
to take you home.

340
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.065
You see the mess
you done got yourself in?

341
00:27:06.699 --> 00:27:08.934
You ain't nothing
but a damn stupid fool.

342
00:27:18.878 --> 00:27:21.080
I'm not grateful
for your mission here.

343
00:27:22.014 --> 00:27:25.050
But I should thank you
for possibly saving my life.

344
00:27:26.018 --> 00:27:27.887
Hannon was a foolish man.

345
00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.189
Mr. Hannon was
a treacherous man.

346
00:27:32.024 --> 00:27:33.826
Get yourself together,
Mrs. Kidd,

347
00:27:33.859 --> 00:27:36.295
and whatever you need,
we ride within the hour.

348
00:27:38.297 --> 00:27:41.000
I suppose I need
to surrender my gun.

349
00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:43.402
I keep a derringer in my valise.

350
00:27:49.775 --> 00:27:51.810
I'm doing this because
Elijah might

351
00:27:51.844 --> 00:27:53.879
try to do something foolish.

352
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.148
I wouldn't want
to see him killed.

353
00:27:57.449 --> 00:27:59.451
I'd feel more than
partially responsible

354
00:27:59.485 --> 00:28:01.120
if he came to any harm.

355
00:28:01.754 --> 00:28:05.257
Deserted the army,
attempted extortion.

356
00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:07.092
He's coming in
for a lot of harm.

357
00:28:07.493 --> 00:28:10.496
Maybe the easiest way out
of this mess is to shoot you.

358
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.998
And solve at least
some of my problems.

359
00:28:13.766 --> 00:28:16.168
I don't think that's such
a good idea, Mrs. Kidd.

360
00:28:27.146 --> 00:28:30.349
Mr. Borlund,
I have a question.

361
00:28:32.552 --> 00:28:35.988
Are you under the impression
that you are rescuing me?

362
00:28:36.388 --> 00:28:38.057
I was told
that you were abducted.

363
00:28:38.558 --> 00:28:40.125
That was a lie.

364
00:28:40.159 --> 00:28:43.128
I've also been told that
by Sergeant Poe.

365
00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.245
When you killed Mr. Hannon
back at his cabin...

366
00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:34.179
Mm-hmm.

367
00:29:35.347 --> 00:29:38.150
Your bullets missed
my head by inches.

368
00:29:38.183 --> 00:29:39.251
Mm-hmm.

369
00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.322
You're that confident
in your marksmanship?

370
00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:45.057
No.

371
00:29:49.895 --> 00:29:51.163
Thought you was my friend.

372
00:29:52.632 --> 00:29:54.567
You went and turned
your back on me.

373
00:29:59.972 --> 00:30:01.407
Now, you listen to me, brother.

374
00:30:02.274 --> 00:30:03.576
This thing ain't over yet.

375
00:30:04.644 --> 00:30:06.579
I might just be able
to get you out of this mess

376
00:30:06.613 --> 00:30:08.080
you done put yourself in.

377
00:30:09.315 --> 00:30:10.883
Oh, and let me say this.

378
00:30:12.151 --> 00:30:14.153
I still think it's a good idea
you and the army is finished.

379
00:30:15.054 --> 00:30:17.256
You wasn't exactly
the soldier type of fella.

380
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.492
I go along with the notion
seeing it's a real good idea

381
00:30:20.527 --> 00:30:23.329
that you end up in Cuba
some such. You hear me?

382
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:26.899
Maybe you ought a hear this.

383
00:30:27.499 --> 00:30:29.902
I got me and Rachel
an insurance policy.

384
00:30:30.537 --> 00:30:32.171
His name is Tiberio.

385
00:30:34.473 --> 00:30:36.041
You know I'm married.

386
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.547
Certainly, you know I've run off
with a man of color.

387
00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.483
I expect you think you have me
pretty well figured out.

388
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.957
Your husband hired me to take
you back across the border.

389
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:54.226
Beyond that, I have no opinion.

390
00:30:55.194 --> 00:30:57.597
Martin Kidd is not simply
a bad husband.

391
00:30:58.598 --> 00:31:00.966
He's also a very bad man.

392
00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:05.270
Not everyone I work for
is a saint.

393
00:31:06.506 --> 00:31:09.408
I took a job and I intend
to earn my money.

394
00:31:10.943 --> 00:31:12.579
You live by a code?

395
00:31:13.145 --> 00:31:14.246
I try.

396
00:31:14.279 --> 00:31:16.014
You ever question it?

397
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:18.016
Not often.

398
00:31:19.184 --> 00:31:20.587
Got a wife?

399
00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:29.629
I don't think I'm a good fit
for the whole idea.

400
00:31:29.662 --> 00:31:30.929
Yeah, well...

401
00:31:31.698 --> 00:31:33.566
Excuse me, I gotta see
Mr. Poe.

402
00:31:44.376 --> 00:31:46.613
Go get something to eat,
I'll relieve you.

403
00:31:47.312 --> 00:31:49.415
You can spell me
in four hours, I'll wake you.

404
00:31:49.448 --> 00:31:52.050
I got some information
about Elijah.

405
00:31:52.084 --> 00:31:53.485
The goddamn fool done made
some type of deal

406
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.920
with that Tiberio fella.

407
00:31:56.288 --> 00:31:58.558
Does... Does Mrs. Kidd
know that?

408
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:02.060
I don't know for sure,
but I expect so.

409
00:32:10.335 --> 00:32:12.204
Very interesting game, poker.

410
00:32:12.672 --> 00:32:14.507
Sometimes, it's hard to figure

411
00:32:14.541 --> 00:32:18.177
when the man's bluffing
or when he's got the goods.

412
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.212
So far,
you seem to be on your game.

413
00:32:24.249 --> 00:32:25.552
You know, I like to know

414
00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:27.453
the name of the people
I play cards with. That way,

415
00:32:27.486 --> 00:32:29.087
when they take my money,
it makes it that little

416
00:32:29.121 --> 00:32:30.389
bit more friendly.

417
00:32:30.422 --> 00:32:32.424
You played here
for an hour and a half,

418
00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:34.561
and not knowing my name
didn't seem to bother you

419
00:32:34.594 --> 00:32:36.028
until I started winning.

420
00:32:36.061 --> 00:32:37.597
Well, you do show some signs

421
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.264
of being a professional
card shark.

422
00:32:39.298 --> 00:32:40.733
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:32:41.601 --> 00:32:44.537
I'll take that
as a sign of respect.

424
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:46.539
Well, it wasn't meant
in that spirit.

425
00:32:46.573 --> 00:32:48.273
Now, I'd like to have a name,

426
00:32:48.307 --> 00:32:49.709
unless it's something
you're ashamed of.

427
00:32:49.742 --> 00:32:51.511
One card.

428
00:32:51.544 --> 00:32:52.745
Sure thing, amigo.

429
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:57.015
But I want to be real polite.

430
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:58.250
You first.

431
00:32:58.651 --> 00:33:01.721
With pleasure.
William Palmer Esquire,

432
00:33:01.754 --> 00:33:03.155
firm purchase agent for the

433
00:33:03.188 --> 00:33:04.791
Turnbull Mining
Properties Limited.

434
00:33:04.824 --> 00:33:07.192
Offices in London, Manchester,
and New Orleans.

435
00:33:07.226 --> 00:33:09.995
Around here, they refer to me
as Guillermo InglÃ©s.

436
00:33:10.362 --> 00:33:13.365
English Bill.
Long way from home.

437
00:33:13.398 --> 00:33:14.500
Indeed.

438
00:33:16.335 --> 00:33:17.503
And you are?

439
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.440
Joe Cribbens. I'm from Texas.

440
00:33:24.544 --> 00:33:29.081
You seem to be a man of strong
opinions, English Bill.

441
00:33:29.114 --> 00:33:31.416
Mr. Palmer, if you please.

442
00:33:31.818 --> 00:33:34.186
Now, let me put you on notice,
Mr. Cribbens.

443
00:33:34.219 --> 00:33:35.822
I'm a very, very good
card player.

444
00:33:35.855 --> 00:33:38.423
I do not intend to be taken in
by any tricks of your trade

445
00:33:38.457 --> 00:33:41.059
because I am not a man
to be taken advantage of.

446
00:33:41.093 --> 00:33:44.062
I can defend myself adequately
here in this rough terrain.

447
00:33:44.096 --> 00:33:46.198
I'm also here on business
with Mr. Tiberio Vargas,

448
00:33:46.231 --> 00:33:47.534
who, as you must certainly know,

449
00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:49.536
is lord of all he surveys
in these parts.

450
00:33:50.603 --> 00:33:55.808
Now, since I think you're just
another bullshit Englishman,

451
00:33:55.842 --> 00:33:58.511
the kind of fella
we gringos have already

452
00:33:58.545 --> 00:34:00.647
whipped twice in two wars...

453
00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:04.483
Why don't we cut the blabber

454
00:34:04.517 --> 00:34:07.152
and just concentrate
on playing cards?

455
00:34:11.791 --> 00:34:13.358
Well, hell!

456
00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:18.598
English Bill. Your luck's bound
to change sometime.

457
00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:21.500
So, I guess I'll call.

458
00:34:22.301 --> 00:34:24.837
With... two itty-bitty pairs.

459
00:34:27.907 --> 00:34:29.374
Son of a bitch.

460
00:34:29.408 --> 00:34:31.476
Some fellas just can't get
away with a bluff.

461
00:34:31.511 --> 00:34:33.478
They lack the character for it.

462
00:34:33.513 --> 00:34:34.379
I'll tell you this
Mr. Cribbens,

463
00:34:34.413 --> 00:34:36.248
you're damn lucky
I'm not wearing a gun.

464
00:34:36.281 --> 00:34:38.116
And I'll tell you this,
English Bill.

465
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.319
You're damn lucky
I don't put a bullet up your ass

466
00:34:40.352 --> 00:34:41.888
just on general principle.

467
00:34:41.921 --> 00:34:46.859
Now, if I was you,
I'd get out of my sight,

468
00:34:46.893 --> 00:34:49.461
before I run through
all my good humor.

469
00:36:01.233 --> 00:36:03.703
I have a fugitive of the law,

470
00:36:03.736 --> 00:36:07.172
army deserter and extortionist.

471
00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:15.515
I am Max Borlund representing
the United States army.

472
00:36:15.548 --> 00:36:17.850
And I am Captain
Miguel A rag on.

473
00:36:17.884 --> 00:36:19.886
Chief Magistrate
of Trinidad Maria.

474
00:36:19.919 --> 00:36:21.453
At your service.

475
00:36:21.486 --> 00:36:23.923
- Who's the woman?
- I have a name.

476
00:36:25.024 --> 00:36:27.225
Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

477
00:36:27.259 --> 00:36:30.362
You can put the prisoner
in a cell and send a telegram

478
00:36:30.395 --> 00:36:32.965
to the territorial deputy
in Santa Fe saying that you have

479
00:36:32.999 --> 00:36:35.902
a Private Elijah Jones
in your custody.

480
00:36:35.935 --> 00:36:38.336
You have no jurisdiction here.

481
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.606
Yes. But your country's law

482
00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.809
doesn't permit deserters
of foreign armies

483
00:36:42.842 --> 00:36:44.610
to find safe haven.

484
00:36:44.644 --> 00:36:47.947
There's an honorable tradition
of extraditing men

485
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.682
who come here
with bad intentions.

486
00:36:49.716 --> 00:36:50.950
Maybe you ought a
hear this, Captain.

487
00:36:51.718 --> 00:36:55.353
You lock me up, Tiberio Vargas
might not like it one damn bit.

488
00:36:55.387 --> 00:36:56.856
- Tiberio Vargas?
- Uh-huh. Me and him

489
00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:59.826
were talking business before
this bounty man showed up.

490
00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.963
By the way, he killed a man.
Jack Hannon.

491
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.268
- You killed a man?
- Yeah.

492
00:37:11.037 --> 00:37:15.007
American. Wanted criminal
who resisted arrest.

493
00:37:15.041 --> 00:37:17.476
They're witnesses.
- Yes.

494
00:37:18.611 --> 00:37:21.881
Mr. Borlund killed Mr. Hannon
after he put a gun to my head.

495
00:37:22.615 --> 00:37:25.417
Mr. Borlund probably
saved my life.

496
00:37:31.924 --> 00:37:33.793
We are officers of the law.

497
00:37:34.894 --> 00:37:36.294
We will lock him up.

498
00:37:46.539 --> 00:37:48.508
Can't say I didn't do nothing
for you, brother.

499
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.477
Yeah, real goddamn funny.

500
00:37:52.512 --> 00:37:54.346
Well, I'll check in on you
every now and then,

501
00:37:54.379 --> 00:37:55.748
make sure they're
feeding you proper.

502
00:38:02.021 --> 00:38:04.991
Mr. Borlund,
a word in private.

503
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.673
I'm sorry, Elijah.

504
00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:23.776
None of this
is turning out right.

505
00:38:24.409 --> 00:38:27.479
Yeah. Gotta admit,

506
00:38:27.513 --> 00:38:29.749
Cuba's looking real far away.

507
00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.789
My government expects me
to protect lives and property.

508
00:38:36.823 --> 00:38:39.025
If Tiberio Vargas becomes angry,

509
00:38:39.058 --> 00:38:41.127
or attempts to profit
from this situation,

510
00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.762
there could be trouble.

511
00:38:42.795 --> 00:38:45.531
This town is under
my jurisdiction,

512
00:38:45.565 --> 00:38:48.100
but out there, Tiberio is king.

513
00:38:49.101 --> 00:38:51.737
There are those who come here
and then break the law.

514
00:38:51.771 --> 00:38:53.639
Two gringos.

515
00:38:53.673 --> 00:38:56.075
They were robbing local farmers,
hiding up in the mountains.

516
00:38:56.108 --> 00:38:58.744
Tiberio and his men
hunted them down.

517
00:38:58.778 --> 00:39:01.147
I let them hang
for two weeks after that.

518
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.082
The smell gets very bad.

519
00:39:03.115 --> 00:39:04.951
Did you give them a trial?

520
00:39:06.652 --> 00:39:08.521
It wasn't necessary.

521
00:39:15.962 --> 00:39:18.931
You should go over to the
hotel and get yourself a room.

522
00:39:21.667 --> 00:39:25.538
Unfortunately, I am without
sufficient funds.

523
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:26.873
Yeah, I'll take care of that

524
00:39:26.906 --> 00:39:29.008
after I send a telegram
to your husband.

525
00:39:35.047 --> 00:39:37.083
See all this mess
you done caused?

526
00:39:37.116 --> 00:39:39.151
Runaway woman,

527
00:39:39.185 --> 00:39:42.688
bounty hunter,
price on your head...

528
00:39:44.156 --> 00:39:46.659
And believe me, for sure,
they'd rather see you dead.

529
00:39:46.692 --> 00:39:48.828
Guess I was better off
in the army all those years

530
00:39:48.861 --> 00:39:50.563
taking nothing but shit.

531
00:39:50.596 --> 00:39:53.132
And knowing if I quit the army,

532
00:39:53.165 --> 00:39:56.501
I ain't got much chance
of doing nothing else.

533
00:39:56.535 --> 00:39:59.071
Except shining shoes
or serving food.

534
00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:02.041
Well no, sir.

535
00:40:03.209 --> 00:40:04.877
No thank you.

536
00:40:47.687 --> 00:40:49.055
Do you speak English?

537
00:40:49.088 --> 00:40:50.523
I do, SeÃ±or.

538
00:40:50.556 --> 00:40:52.490
Mrs. Kidd will need a room

539
00:40:52.525 --> 00:40:56.494
for a few days, maybe more.
I need a room as well.

540
00:40:57.863 --> 00:41:00.700
Number four, at the top
of those stairs.

541
00:41:00.733 --> 00:41:02.134
Thank you.

542
00:41:02.168 --> 00:41:05.071
You have number two,
across the hallway.

543
00:41:05.104 --> 00:41:07.106
- Thanks.
- SeÃ±or.

544
00:41:11.844 --> 00:41:14.080
I suppose I should say
thank you,

545
00:41:14.113 --> 00:41:16.682
but then I remember
who you're working for.

546
00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:20.086
It doesn't seem right,

547
00:41:20.119 --> 00:41:22.188
Elijah being treated
like a criminal,

548
00:41:22.221 --> 00:41:24.023
and I'm put up in a nice hotel.

549
00:41:25.591 --> 00:41:28.561
Elijah left the army,
that makes him a deserter.

550
00:41:28.594 --> 00:41:32.064
You left your marriage.
No one goes to jail for that.

551
00:41:54.053 --> 00:41:56.255
Ah, there he is.

552
00:41:56.288 --> 00:42:00.226
Joe Cribbens.
Professional card shark.

553
00:42:01.727 --> 00:42:03.596
See, I've been considering
our card game,

554
00:42:03.629 --> 00:42:05.031
and I believe you cheated me.

555
00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:07.867
I don't need to cheat
to beat you, amigo.

556
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.870
Well, this time, I brought
my service revolver

557
00:42:10.903 --> 00:42:14.173
and I fully intend on dealing
with the situation.

558
00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:17.176
Now, I suggest you give me
back my money

559
00:42:17.209 --> 00:42:19.945
and throw in a few extra
shillings for good measure.

560
00:42:33.059 --> 00:42:37.263
Goddamn Englishman
went and committed suicide.

561
00:42:57.316 --> 00:42:59.218
Esperanza, you can come in.

562
00:43:01.053 --> 00:43:02.855
I thought I picked...
Oh, I'm sorry.

563
00:43:02.888 --> 00:43:04.890
- No, come in.
- What I wanted to discuss...

564
00:43:04.924 --> 00:43:06.358
I said come in.

565
00:43:11.664 --> 00:43:14.333
As you can see, I'm trying
to take a bath.

566
00:43:14.366 --> 00:43:16.669
My first real one in weeks.

567
00:43:19.738 --> 00:43:21.340
What's the matter?

568
00:43:21.373 --> 00:43:22.908
You suspect I'm a whore,

569
00:43:22.942 --> 00:43:24.810
I supposed I might
as well act like one.

570
00:43:27.146 --> 00:43:28.781
Are you getting nervous?

571
00:43:30.116 --> 00:43:32.785
Maybe, like most men,

572
00:43:32.818 --> 00:43:36.956
you're just scared to death of
really dealing with a woman.

573
00:43:36.989 --> 00:43:38.691
Are you finished?

574
00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:44.063
I came to let you know
that tomorrow

575
00:43:44.096 --> 00:43:46.098
I'll start making arrangements

576
00:43:46.132 --> 00:43:48.167
to have you taken back
across the border.

577
00:43:50.236 --> 00:43:52.371
My life is done there.

578
00:43:52.404 --> 00:43:55.007
I have to move on, not go back.

579
00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.309
I appreciate your concern,

580
00:43:57.343 --> 00:43:59.311
but I will be the one
to figure out my life.

581
00:44:00.913 --> 00:44:01.947
Mm-hmm.

582
00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.685
You refuse to go?

583
00:44:06.719 --> 00:44:08.787
I refuse to go.

584
00:44:09.421 --> 00:44:11.690
Even at gun point.

585
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.164
If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

586
00:44:25.204 --> 00:44:26.405
As you have been told,

587
00:44:26.438 --> 00:44:28.307
I'm here representing
Tiberio Vargas.

588
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.143
He has already heard about this
unfortunate incident.

589
00:44:31.177 --> 00:44:34.413
Look, this man tried
to kill me, came here to do it.

590
00:44:34.446 --> 00:44:37.716
Most likely a real shit heel
in general.

591
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.052
I figured I was doing
everybody a favor.

592
00:44:40.085 --> 00:44:43.722
We need no favors,
but possibly you do.

593
00:44:43.756 --> 00:44:46.258
This man you killed
was doing serious business

594
00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:47.493
with Tiberio Vargas.

595
00:44:47.527 --> 00:44:50.129
Tiberio Vargas,
I keep hearing the name.

596
00:44:50.162 --> 00:44:52.831
Mmm, you do not want him
for an enemy.

597
00:45:02.908 --> 00:45:04.276
Joe Cribbens.

598
00:45:06.312 --> 00:45:10.349
Name's not Joseph.
Just Joe will cover the deal.

599
00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:13.118
I was Texas, born and bred.

600
00:45:13.152 --> 00:45:15.522
Been knocking around
since I was 15.

601
00:45:15.555 --> 00:45:17.957
Worked Teamster, worked Trooper.

602
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:19.758
Drifted some.

603
00:45:19.792 --> 00:45:21.827
I always liked playing cards.

604
00:45:23.128 --> 00:45:26.098
Tell me why you shot
this Englishman.

605
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.537
I beat him at cards.
I beat him fair and square.

606
00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:32.404
He didn't take it too good.

607
00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:35.140
Guess I just turned out
to be the better man.

608
00:45:35.174 --> 00:45:38.277
Luis agrees the Englishman
shot first.

609
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:43.282
He's an honest man.
Tiberio will consider all this.

610
00:45:43.315 --> 00:45:45.184
You must wait here in Guadalupe

611
00:45:45.217 --> 00:45:47.453
while Tiberio makes
his decision.

612
00:45:48.354 --> 00:45:51.524
Damn. My luck's run bad.

613
00:46:52.084 --> 00:46:55.387
Mr. Borlund. We meet again.

614
00:46:55.421 --> 00:46:58.891
This time, I'm happy to say
I'm not sitting in a bathtub.

615
00:46:58.924 --> 00:47:00.560
Do you have news?

616
00:47:00.593 --> 00:47:03.028
I was just informed
a few minutes ago

617
00:47:03.062 --> 00:47:06.365
by Captain A rag on that
your husband is on his way here,

618
00:47:06.398 --> 00:47:08.300
he's travelling by coach.

619
00:47:08.334 --> 00:47:11.837
I am to watch over you
until he arrives.

620
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.613
A very bad situation
now made worse.

621
00:47:26.553 --> 00:47:28.253
The last time we talked,

622
00:47:28.287 --> 00:47:31.023
I was extremely short-tempered.
I apologize.

623
00:47:31.056 --> 00:47:32.559
No apology necessary.

624
00:47:32.592 --> 00:47:37.329
I've decided you need to be in
greater possession of the facts.

625
00:47:37.363 --> 00:47:39.532
I believe you need
to know my story.

626
00:47:40.567 --> 00:47:43.969
It begins with
a well-off family.

627
00:47:44.002 --> 00:47:46.506
I'm the youngest
of three sisters,

628
00:47:46.539 --> 00:47:49.074
educated by a series
of governesses.

629
00:47:49.642 --> 00:47:53.112
Rebellious. Didn't get along
with anybody much,

630
00:47:53.145 --> 00:47:55.481
including my parents
and my sisters.

631
00:47:56.716 --> 00:48:01.153
Fell in love at 17.
It was quite passionate.

632
00:48:02.388 --> 00:48:06.024
I've always resisted
traditional morality.

633
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.096
My mother once told me,
"You only fall completely

634
00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:15.234
in love once, and usually,
when you're very young."

635
00:48:17.202 --> 00:48:19.572
She also told me,
"Almost no woman ends up

636
00:48:19.606 --> 00:48:21.206
with her first choice."

637
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.143
Five years later,
I met Martin Kidd.

638
00:48:25.344 --> 00:48:28.447
He was charming, ambitious,

639
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:31.551
seemed very rich,
and he was from the west.

640
00:48:32.752 --> 00:48:35.988
I desperately wanted to get away
from where I grew up.

641
00:48:36.021 --> 00:48:39.158
We had a quick romance, and four
weeks later, we were married.

642
00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:41.260
We went to live
in his home in Santa Fe.

643
00:48:42.662 --> 00:48:46.031
Then, the horror started.

644
00:48:47.399 --> 00:48:50.068
I discovered he's a crook,

645
00:48:50.102 --> 00:48:55.207
a conniver, an extortionist,
a land cheat.

646
00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.376
He constantly consorted
with other women,

647
00:48:57.409 --> 00:48:59.144
usually prostitutes.

648
00:48:59.178 --> 00:49:03.148
I was reduced to being
that which I most despise,

649
00:49:03.182 --> 00:49:05.451
a decoration wife.

650
00:49:07.186 --> 00:49:12.224
To my shame, I took all of it
and more for five years.

651
00:49:13.459 --> 00:49:16.161
There were endless fights
with Martin.

652
00:49:16.195 --> 00:49:20.700
Finally, he condescendingly
allowed me to start a school.

653
00:49:20.733 --> 00:49:25.037
I taught those who had very
little advantage in life, and...

654
00:49:27.439 --> 00:49:30.042
And as time passed,
I eventually became

655
00:49:30.075 --> 00:49:33.378
more than a teacher
with one of my students.

656
00:49:33.412 --> 00:49:35.247
Elijah Jones.

657
00:49:37.483 --> 00:49:39.051
Elijah Jones.

658
00:49:40.052 --> 00:49:42.789
He had his own set of problems.

659
00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:46.659
I was sympathetic.
One thing led to another.

660
00:49:46.693 --> 00:49:50.229
Eventually, we realized escape
was our only recourse.

661
00:49:50.262 --> 00:49:52.498
So we made a plan to run off.

662
00:49:53.298 --> 00:49:54.634
And did.

663
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:58.504
I suppose you know the rest.

664
00:50:01.541 --> 00:50:03.375
He's a good person.

665
00:50:04.209 --> 00:50:07.514
And often, a great comfort to
me, but we are very different.

666
00:50:07.547 --> 00:50:09.414
We have no future together.

667
00:50:10.617 --> 00:50:13.285
We've had some good times,
but eventually,

668
00:50:13.318 --> 00:50:15.788
we will go our separate ways.
We both know it.

669
00:50:15.822 --> 00:50:17.757
Probably sooner than later.

670
00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:22.294
If I'm being completely honest,

671
00:50:22.327 --> 00:50:26.164
Elijah was not the first
of my romantic adventures

672
00:50:26.198 --> 00:50:27.734
since I married Martin.

673
00:50:28.768 --> 00:50:31.370
Most were in simple retaliation.

674
00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:37.577
Well, I think I've done
enough confessing.

675
00:50:40.412 --> 00:50:43.683
I want you to think of me
as an honest person.

676
00:50:44.684 --> 00:50:46.586
However, imperfect.

677
00:50:46.619 --> 00:50:48.721
I want you to think of me
as an honest person,

678
00:50:48.755 --> 00:50:51.089
because I believe
that matters to you.

679
00:50:51.123 --> 00:50:55.093
I just want to say this,
for the record.

680
00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:02.735
When my husband gets here,
he intends to kill me.

681
00:51:14.647 --> 00:51:16.583
I know you heard
Mrs. Kidd and the others

682
00:51:16.616 --> 00:51:17.784
can't come visit you.

683
00:51:19.484 --> 00:51:21.788
Anybody bother giving a reason?

684
00:51:21.821 --> 00:51:23.856
Just when we're kicking
the balls for Elijah.

685
00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:27.660
Captain A rag on said the bounty
man and me has jurisdiction.

686
00:51:27.694 --> 00:51:30.162
Ain't nobody else allowed.
- Yeah.

687
00:51:31.263 --> 00:51:33.198
Just one more kick
in the balls, huh.

688
00:51:33.231 --> 00:51:35.300
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.

689
00:51:35.334 --> 00:51:36.769
It don't help a damn thing.

690
00:51:37.704 --> 00:51:40.640
And you know Mr. Kidd himself
is on the way up here right now.

691
00:51:42.374 --> 00:51:44.142
Yeah.

692
00:51:44.644 --> 00:51:46.178
Oh yeah, I heard.

693
00:51:46.646 --> 00:51:49.147
Captain A rag on told me.

694
00:51:49.181 --> 00:51:51.517
You know, I just figure
he's bringing the ransom money

695
00:51:51.551 --> 00:51:53.586
in a... personal way.

696
00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:56.154
More likely he coming up
to settle things with you.

697
00:51:56.188 --> 00:51:57.924
Now, I gotta figure out a way
how I'm a bust you up

698
00:51:57.957 --> 00:52:00.325
out of here and get you on your
way to some half-ass freedom.

699
00:52:00.827 --> 00:52:02.294
Now first...

700
00:52:02.629 --> 00:52:04.262
And you gotta do this...

701
00:52:05.932 --> 00:52:07.800
Forget this white woman.

702
00:52:08.367 --> 00:52:09.669
You travelling with her,
you get spotted

703
00:52:09.702 --> 00:52:11.738
real easy and you finished.

704
00:52:11.771 --> 00:52:14.306
Plus, I gotta figure out a way
how I'm gonna stay clean.

705
00:52:14.339 --> 00:52:15.908
Because I plans to be
going back home,

706
00:52:15.942 --> 00:52:17.844
- and I'm going back to the army.
- That's what it is.

707
00:52:17.877 --> 00:52:20.212
Don't let nothing interfere
with what's good for Alonzo Poe.

708
00:52:20.245 --> 00:52:21.480
You goddamn right!

709
00:52:21.514 --> 00:52:22.749
Because I sure as shit
ain't finna go

710
00:52:22.782 --> 00:52:24.349
outlaw for a dumb-ass like you.

711
00:52:24.383 --> 00:52:26.318
You've already caused me
enough grief.

712
00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.690
Now, keep your mouth shut,
keep your eyes open,

713
00:52:30.723 --> 00:52:32.759
and boy, you better pray...

714
00:52:32.792 --> 00:52:34.861
that I can do you
some real good.

715
00:52:46.572 --> 00:52:48.373
Mr. Borlund,

716
00:52:48.407 --> 00:52:50.375
I figured I'd take
the horses out for exercise.

717
00:52:50.409 --> 00:52:52.645
Wanna keep 'em fit.

718
00:52:52.679 --> 00:52:54.580
Very good, Mr. Poe.

719
00:52:54.614 --> 00:52:56.281
Yes, sir.

720
00:52:58.017 --> 00:53:00.452
Boots and saddle, slap leather
and ride.

721
00:53:00.485 --> 00:53:01.521
That's our motto.

722
00:53:02.689 --> 00:53:05.591
I'm a cavalry man.
So I sticks to it.

723
00:53:07.026 --> 00:53:09.194
- Sergeant Poe.
- Yes, sir.

724
00:53:10.697 --> 00:53:13.231
With the prisoner
Elijah Jones...

725
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.333
Yes, sir.

726
00:53:15.802 --> 00:53:17.436
Don't do anything stupid

727
00:53:17.469 --> 00:53:19.906
like try to break him out
of jail and set him free.

728
00:53:20.973 --> 00:53:22.207
Yes, sir.

729
00:53:22.842 --> 00:53:24.342
Why would you think that?

730
00:53:24.376 --> 00:53:25.578
Because you're not as clever

731
00:53:25.611 --> 00:53:27.880
and I'm not as stupid
as you imagine.

732
00:53:30.415 --> 00:53:33.418
Yes, sir. I mean... No, sir.

733
00:53:39.058 --> 00:53:42.227
The time to do it
is when step back to the border.

734
00:53:44.731 --> 00:53:46.799
Now I'm a little
confused here. Uh...

735
00:53:49.702 --> 00:53:51.303
You mean...

736
00:53:51.738 --> 00:53:53.873
I mean, this whole job is a lie

737
00:53:53.906 --> 00:53:55.575
and it started as a lie.

738
00:53:55.608 --> 00:53:58.745
I don't like being lied to
and I don't like being used.

739
00:54:00.947 --> 00:54:02.615
You're gonna help me
let Elijah go?

740
00:54:02.648 --> 00:54:03.916
You have my word.

741
00:54:04.617 --> 00:54:05.818
Well, sir...

742
00:54:07.385 --> 00:54:09.021
Sure is full of surprises.

743
00:54:09.055 --> 00:54:10.056
Yeah.

744
00:54:14.927 --> 00:54:16.495
Look who's coming.

745
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:28.508
Tiberio wants to start
negotiating about Elijah.

746
00:54:33.478 --> 00:54:35.014
Yeah, I'll handle the diplomacy.

747
00:54:35.047 --> 00:54:36.883
You go and cause
a little trouble.

748
00:54:36.916 --> 00:54:39.919
I don't want Tiberio
to think we're pushover.

749
00:54:39.952 --> 00:54:41.721
How about I go tell
Mr. Peckerwood

750
00:54:41.754 --> 00:54:42.955
over there a thing or two?

751
00:54:42.989 --> 00:54:44.891
Seeing that he was
kind of insulting me...

752
00:54:45.925 --> 00:54:47.459
Yeah, go ahead.

753
00:54:48.493 --> 00:54:49.762
Try not to kill him.

754
00:54:49.796 --> 00:54:51.030
Yes, sir.

755
00:54:51.063 --> 00:54:53.833
I'll go have a drink
and wait for Esteban.

756
00:55:23.696 --> 00:55:25.898
Well, howdy, Tyree.

757
00:55:25.932 --> 00:55:27.600
Say, you remember me, right?

758
00:55:27.633 --> 00:55:29.135
The fellow with the gun?

759
00:55:29.168 --> 00:55:31.771
Yeah. Out there
at the water hole.

760
00:55:31.804 --> 00:55:33.039
That's right.

761
00:55:33.072 --> 00:55:35.440
I see you still got
a real smart mouth.

762
00:55:35.808 --> 00:55:37.810
You need to learn some manners.

763
00:55:37.844 --> 00:55:41.047
Maybe I ought to bullwhip me
a real uppity fella.

764
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.448
Just might do you some good.

765
00:55:45.651 --> 00:55:48.821
Now, Jack, I know you ain't
the smartest man I ever met,

766
00:55:49.956 --> 00:55:53.926
but maybe you forgot that
I'm the one carrying the gun.

767
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.460
Yeah, well...

768
00:55:56.062 --> 00:55:58.097
Go ahead and shoot me.

769
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:59.497
And those fellows over there...

770
00:56:00.633 --> 00:56:02.835
...well, they'll shoot you.

771
00:56:05.503 --> 00:56:08.373
SeÃ±or Borlund,
we meet another time.

772
00:56:09.942 --> 00:56:14.013
I'm afraid Tiberio has now heard
you're a bounty man, yes?

773
00:56:15.114 --> 00:56:17.449
He thought you were
looking for gold.

774
00:56:18.217 --> 00:56:21.120
Well, he'll just have to learn
to live with the truth.

775
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:31.797
Thank you.

776
00:56:33.532 --> 00:56:35.768
Tiberio feels he was deceived.

777
00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:37.770
You should know this...

778
00:56:37.803 --> 00:56:40.940
Tiberio has made a business
arrangement with your prisoner.

779
00:56:43.776 --> 00:56:45.011
I'm aware of that.

780
00:56:46.145 --> 00:56:50.182
But due to circumstances,
that deal is null and void.

781
00:56:59.892 --> 00:57:03.195
That... idea will be
unacceptable.

782
00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:07.767
5,000 dollars American
is owed to him.

783
00:57:08.734 --> 00:57:10.536
You know what?

784
00:57:10.569 --> 00:57:13.506
Goddammit, Jack, you're right.

785
00:57:13.539 --> 00:57:14.840
You're right.

786
00:57:14.874 --> 00:57:17.109
Because I occasionally
keep one of these handy

787
00:57:17.143 --> 00:57:19.912
when I gotta bullwhip me
some damn yokel.

788
00:57:25.851 --> 00:57:28.254
First five years in the army,
they had me working Teamster.

789
00:57:28.287 --> 00:57:31.257
And I was cracking one of these
every day of the week.

790
00:58:18.904 --> 00:58:20.840
Lucky son of a bitch.

791
00:58:26.112 --> 00:58:27.613
SeÃ±or Borlund...

792
00:58:28.748 --> 00:58:30.816
My advice is for you
and your companion

793
00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:32.918
to go immediately
from this place.

794
00:58:32.952 --> 00:58:35.054
Leave Trinidad Maria at once,

795
00:58:35.087 --> 00:58:37.656
but leave Mrs. Kidd
and Elijah behind.

796
00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:39.892
That's good advice. No.

797
00:58:40.993 --> 00:58:45.131
You can explain to SeÃ±or Tiberio
that I am a man of the law.

798
00:58:46.699 --> 00:58:48.801
And Elijah is a criminal.

799
00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:20.599
You don't much like me,
do you, Mr. Poe?

800
00:59:21.367 --> 00:59:23.736
I'm just doing my job, ma'am.

801
00:59:23.769 --> 00:59:26.172
And Mr. Borlund told me that
I need to watch over you, now.

802
00:59:26.205 --> 00:59:28.207
It's because of Elijah,
isn't it?

803
00:59:29.642 --> 00:59:31.710
You hold the trouble
he's in against me.

804
00:59:32.278 --> 00:59:34.246
I understand that.

805
00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:36.582
But I take it,
despite everything...

806
00:59:37.416 --> 00:59:39.318
...you still like Elijah.

807
00:59:41.253 --> 00:59:43.155
He's awful mad at me.

808
00:59:43.189 --> 00:59:44.757
Thinks I let him down.

809
00:59:46.826 --> 00:59:48.861
I still count him as a friend.

810
00:59:51.831 --> 00:59:55.835
And now, we have these events
that really irritate Tiberio.

811
00:59:55.868 --> 00:59:59.738
The situation with this SeÃ±ora
Kidd is <i>muy complicada.</i>

812
00:59:59.772 --> 01:00:02.274
This man makes things difficult
for Tiberio,

813
01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:06.312
he has little authority over
the situation in Trinidad Maria.

814
01:00:07.113 --> 01:00:09.615
This legal fellow got a name?

815
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:12.818
He's called SeÃ±or Max Borlund.

816
01:00:14.353 --> 01:00:16.856
Uh, say that again.

817
01:00:16.889 --> 01:00:18.757
SeÃ±or Max Borlund.

818
01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:21.026
He's a private investigator.

819
01:00:22.928 --> 01:00:24.864
I know the man.

820
01:00:28.134 --> 01:00:30.669
You see this, Esteban?

821
01:00:30.703 --> 01:00:33.038
You put a gun in it,

822
01:00:33.072 --> 01:00:35.674
and it's the devil's right hand.

823
01:00:49.188 --> 01:00:50.956
I would like to see Elijah.

824
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.192
You have him in that cell there.

825
01:00:53.225 --> 01:00:54.860
Not possible, SeÃ±ora.

826
01:00:54.894 --> 01:00:56.295
The prisoner will have
no visitors

827
01:00:56.328 --> 01:00:58.364
until his legal status
is determined.

828
01:00:58.397 --> 01:01:00.032
He's in my custody, but...

829
01:01:00.065 --> 01:01:02.835
under the jurisdiction
of Mr. Borlund.

830
01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:04.370
Mr...

831
01:01:14.146 --> 01:01:16.148
I'll need my key, please.

832
01:01:16.182 --> 01:01:19.084
- Did you have a pleasant walk?
- I did not.

833
01:01:19.118 --> 01:01:21.420
My friend is in jail and they
refuse to let me see him.

834
01:01:21.453 --> 01:01:23.155
Entirely because of Mr. Borlund.

835
01:01:23.189 --> 01:01:24.890
SeÃ±ora.

836
01:01:24.924 --> 01:01:27.927
This was left for you
by Mr. Borlund.

837
01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:36.702
Elijah's gun and mine.

838
01:01:39.371 --> 01:01:42.174
Mr. Borlund is a man
of surprises.

839
01:02:12.404 --> 01:02:14.206
Hola, Tiberio.

840
01:02:15.474 --> 01:02:17.142
You were expecting me.

841
01:02:17.176 --> 01:02:18.410
Yes, sir.

842
01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:20.412
After my friendly talk
with Esteban,

843
01:02:20.446 --> 01:02:23.749
I figured you might wanna
get to know Joe Cribbens.

844
01:02:24.584 --> 01:02:26.418
I hear all the news and gossip

845
01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:30.055
since I've been staying in this
near-ghost town of yours.

846
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:33.526
I even hear you're up against
Max Borlund.

847
01:02:34.326 --> 01:02:36.462
He's a man with a reputation.

848
01:02:37.429 --> 01:02:39.098
And I owe him.

849
01:02:39.131 --> 01:02:40.833
You owe him?

850
01:02:40.866 --> 01:02:42.134
A favor?

851
01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:44.937
No, <i>jefe.</i>

852
01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.872
He's not my amigo.

853
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.174
<i>Oy, hombre.</i>

854
01:02:52.344 --> 01:02:56.382
Why don't you tell me about
this... Max Borlund?

855
01:02:56.415 --> 01:02:59.351
Then, afterwards, maybe I have
somebody shoot you.

856
01:03:01.186 --> 01:03:03.122
Have I offended you, <i>jefe?</i>

857
01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:04.591
You killed the Englishman.

858
01:03:04.624 --> 01:03:07.926
He was doing a land contract
with me for many pesos.

859
01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:10.362
- He accused me of cheating.
- Were you guilty?

860
01:03:10.396 --> 01:03:12.398
I didn't need to cheat him.

861
01:03:13.299 --> 01:03:15.134
I'm a good card player.

862
01:03:16.235 --> 01:03:18.003
So am I, <i>hombre.</i>

863
01:03:18.037 --> 01:03:19.506
So am I.

864
01:03:32.885 --> 01:03:34.286
Three cards.

865
01:03:50.402 --> 01:03:53.038
I wanna see what you have, <i>jefe.</i>

866
01:03:54.674 --> 01:03:56.075
I have the winner.

867
01:03:58.243 --> 01:04:00.547
Ah... Sorry, <i>jefe.</i>

868
01:04:05.984 --> 01:04:08.220
Most men are afraid
to beat me at cards.

869
01:04:08.921 --> 01:04:10.356
To take my money.

870
01:04:11.691 --> 01:04:14.393
If I lost on purpose,
I'd be insulting you.

871
01:04:15.294 --> 01:04:18.631
This way, I prove I respect
the way you honor a game

872
01:04:18.665 --> 01:04:21.166
of skill and good fortune.

873
01:04:22.368 --> 01:04:23.570
<i>America no?</i>

874
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:26.740
<i>America no,</i> from Texas.

875
01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:33.178
I decide not to kill you.

876
01:04:33.212 --> 01:04:35.114
I decide to use you.

877
01:04:35.147 --> 01:04:37.182
<i>Oy, hombre,</i>
I don't like to lose money.

878
01:04:37.216 --> 01:04:38.551
Another game.

879
01:04:38.585 --> 01:04:40.185
But understand this:

880
01:04:40.219 --> 01:04:42.121
Now, you work for me.

881
01:04:42.988 --> 01:04:44.524
You will follow orders.

882
01:05:10.583 --> 01:05:14.554
Old man, go find the gringo
bounty man.

883
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:18.090
Tell him to prepare
to go to hell.

884
01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:20.259
Tell him I intend to kill him.

885
01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.175
Joe Cribbens.

886
01:06:10.209 --> 01:06:11.611
What, you know him?

887
01:06:11.644 --> 01:06:13.412
He's a dangerous man.

888
01:06:14.413 --> 01:06:16.583
You ain't got nothing
to worry about.

889
01:06:16.616 --> 01:06:19.318
He kill you, I kill him.

890
01:06:29.662 --> 01:06:32.064
I hear you're breaking
your promise.

891
01:06:32.097 --> 01:06:33.600
You're looking for me,
after all.

892
01:06:33.633 --> 01:06:36.335
Yeah. Time and circumstance.

893
01:06:36.368 --> 01:06:39.004
Besides, it's a long
time coming.

894
01:06:40.072 --> 01:06:42.542
I got lots of personal feelings
against you, Mr. Borlund,

895
01:06:42.575 --> 01:06:44.777
but that's not why I'm here.

896
01:06:44.811 --> 01:06:47.312
Right now, I'm just getting
paid to do a job.

897
01:06:48.548 --> 01:06:52.351
But first, since this
is a special occasion,

898
01:06:53.385 --> 01:06:55.287
I guess I'd...

899
01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.322
kind of like to have me a drink.

900
01:07:11.738 --> 01:07:13.472
Time to settle up.

901
01:07:13.506 --> 01:07:16.141
I like to pay off what I owe.

902
01:07:16.174 --> 01:07:18.410
You low-rate me, Mr. Borlund.

903
01:07:18.443 --> 01:07:20.145
Always have.

904
01:07:20.178 --> 01:07:22.815
So, before I lay you low,

905
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:26.385
I'm gonna teach you
how to show me a little respect.

906
01:07:27.754 --> 01:07:28.821
Have one.

907
01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:31.591
Skip the bullshit.

908
01:07:32.457 --> 01:07:34.561
But you can tell me
who's paying you.

909
01:07:35.193 --> 01:07:37.162
Figure you already
know the answer.

910
01:07:37.195 --> 01:07:39.464
Oh, Tiberio's got you
doing the dirty work.

911
01:07:39.498 --> 01:07:41.568
Tiberio's got me doing
the hard work.

912
01:07:41.601 --> 01:07:43.402
See it as a compliment.

913
01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:44.604
I was expecting you was trying

914
01:07:44.637 --> 01:07:46.739
to come in on Mr. Borlund's
bounty money.

915
01:07:46.773 --> 01:07:49.542
I don't make my pesos that way.

916
01:07:50.877 --> 01:07:53.546
I've done a few things
not on the square.

917
01:07:54.413 --> 01:07:56.315
But I never sink that low.

918
01:08:01.854 --> 01:08:03.155
Well...

919
01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.495
If you're not gonna
drink with me...

920
01:08:11.731 --> 01:08:13.365
I guess it's time...

921
01:08:14.433 --> 01:08:16.401
...to see how good
you really are.

922
01:08:16.435 --> 01:08:18.136
Gonna have to take us both.

923
01:08:19.404 --> 01:08:21.541
- Your move, Joe.
- Gentlemen.

924
01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:28.380
My name is Rachel Kidd,
if it's of any interest.

925
01:08:28.413 --> 01:08:29.916
Don't be getting in this, ma'am.

926
01:08:29.949 --> 01:08:33.886
He's right, Mrs. Kidd.
You best back away.

927
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.221
Mr. Borlund and I
have our differences.

928
01:08:36.254 --> 01:08:37.857
But he doesn't deserve
to be gunned down

929
01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.692
by a common criminal.

930
01:08:39.726 --> 01:08:42.361
Oh, I'm not so common, ma'am.

931
01:08:42.394 --> 01:08:45.732
And even though you seem to
have a real unpleasant nature,

932
01:08:45.765 --> 01:08:48.701
I'd still hate to put
the finish on a woman.

933
01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:52.437
It ain't my style.

934
01:08:52.471 --> 01:08:54.907
At this distance,
I don't think I'm going to miss.

935
01:08:55.975 --> 01:08:58.645
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

936
01:08:58.678 --> 01:09:00.713
I will not lose my nerve.

937
01:09:00.747 --> 01:09:02.582
I will pull the trigger.

938
01:09:02.615 --> 01:09:04.449
I promise.

939
01:09:13.325 --> 01:09:15.260
You proud?

940
01:09:15.293 --> 01:09:18.765
Hiding behind a backup gun
and a woman.

941
01:09:19.599 --> 01:09:20.933
Tell you what, Joe.

942
01:09:20.967 --> 01:09:23.468
I think I'd ride on out
before she gets nervous

943
01:09:23.502 --> 01:09:25.805
and accidentally
pulls the trigger.

944
01:09:27.507 --> 01:09:28.875
Okay, amigo.

945
01:09:32.444 --> 01:09:34.847
I guess this hand goes to you.

946
01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:38.518
But... this ain't over yet.

947
01:09:52.497 --> 01:09:55.367
Told you. Ain't got
nothing to worry about.

948
01:09:56.769 --> 01:09:59.237
Once again, Mr. Poe,
very good.

949
01:10:00.305 --> 01:10:02.642
Once good, I aim to please.

950
01:10:13.653 --> 01:10:17.355
Guess it was a good thing
you gave me back my gun.

951
01:10:17.389 --> 01:10:19.926
Joe was right.
This isn't over.

952
01:10:19.959 --> 01:10:24.329
But I appreciate what you did,
even though it was very foolish.

953
01:10:24.362 --> 01:10:27.567
You probably saved my life
back in the cabin.

954
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.401
I owed you.

955
01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:30.870
I try to pay my debts.

956
01:10:32.304 --> 01:10:34.707
I don't really drink,
but I think I need this.

957
01:10:45.551 --> 01:10:48.688
Come to check
on the deserter man.

958
01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:51.524
How long you figure
before Rachel's husband arrives?

959
01:10:52.424 --> 01:10:53.960
About another day or two.

960
01:10:56.062 --> 01:10:58.030
He better be bringing his money.

961
01:11:48.514 --> 01:11:49.916
Driver!

962
01:11:49.949 --> 01:11:51.383
Why in the hell are we stopping?

963
01:11:51.416 --> 01:11:52.985
It's the middle of nowhere.

964
01:11:54.486 --> 01:11:55.988
Hello, ladies.

965
01:11:56.022 --> 01:11:57.857
Martin Kidd, right?

966
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:00.860
You step on out
and come with me.

967
01:12:00.893 --> 01:12:02.628
<i>Por favor.</i>

968
01:12:02.662 --> 01:12:05.430
Mr. Tiberio Vargas would like
to have a talk with you.

969
01:12:24.517 --> 01:12:28.888
I... speak English
a little bit.

970
01:12:29.755 --> 01:12:31.691
But only when I want to.

971
01:13:21.107 --> 01:13:22.174
<i>Vamos.</i>

972
01:13:26.245 --> 01:13:29.181
- Mr. Kidd.
- Mr. Borlund!

973
01:13:29.215 --> 01:13:32.118
You're my welcoming party.
It's good to see you.

974
01:13:32.151 --> 01:13:33.819
How's my wife?

975
01:13:33.853 --> 01:13:36.188
She's in the hotel
down the road.

976
01:13:36.222 --> 01:13:39.759
Oh, that's where she is,
but how is she?

977
01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:43.495
The past few weeks have been
very difficult for her.

978
01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:45.765
And Elijah Jones?

979
01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:48.100
He's in a jail cell
around the corner.

980
01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:51.904
Good. I'll go visit Rachel
in due course,

981
01:13:51.938 --> 01:13:55.041
I'm in no hurry to deal
with her salacious conduct.

982
01:13:56.275 --> 01:13:59.178
Have you met this
Tiberio Vargas?

983
01:13:59.211 --> 01:14:02.048
- Only once.
- He's quite a fellow.

984
01:14:03.282 --> 01:14:06.585
Well, I owe you a debt
of gratitude

985
01:14:06.619 --> 01:14:08.521
for rounding up
these two runaways.

986
01:14:08.554 --> 01:14:09.889
You owe me money.

987
01:14:09.922 --> 01:14:12.457
Oh, I do. And you'll be paid.

988
01:14:13.125 --> 01:14:14.492
Paid in full.

989
01:14:58.838 --> 01:15:01.107
If I may join you,
I wish to discuss with you

990
01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:03.509
the situation we find
ourselves in.

991
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:05.611
Then...

992
01:15:05.644 --> 01:15:08.314
I guess we ought a
discuss Tiberio,

993
01:15:08.347 --> 01:15:10.649
since nobody around here
can take a piss

994
01:15:10.683 --> 01:15:12.184
without him saying so.

995
01:15:12.218 --> 01:15:14.620
Tiberio is of course
disappointed.

996
01:15:14.653 --> 01:15:16.856
He feels your tactics
were too bold.

997
01:15:16.889 --> 01:15:19.191
You were foolish and arrogant.

998
01:15:20.693 --> 01:15:22.962
I am here to tell you that

999
01:15:22.995 --> 01:15:26.032
Tiberio has no further need
of your services.

1000
01:15:28.734 --> 01:15:30.302
You are dismissed.

1001
01:15:31.871 --> 01:15:33.606
You're free to go.

1002
01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:32.331
One thing about you and
your kind, Mr. Cockroach,

1003
01:16:32.364 --> 01:16:34.300
can't get rid of you, can we?

1004
01:16:35.935 --> 01:16:38.771
Yes, sir, you sons of bitches

1005
01:16:38.804 --> 01:16:42.041
must be first cousin
with Mr. Boll Weevil.

1006
01:16:43.109 --> 01:16:45.277
And that means nothing much
good to be said.

1007
01:16:46.145 --> 01:16:48.114
Just a goddamn nuisance.

1008
01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:13.339
Mr. Borlund.

1009
01:17:13.973 --> 01:17:16.408
Have you seen your husband yet?

1010
01:17:18.144 --> 01:17:21.914
I think he made some kind
of a deal with Tiberio Vargas,

1011
01:17:21.947 --> 01:17:23.349
probably about you.

1012
01:17:23.382 --> 01:17:25.818
I just wanted to make sure
you're alright.

1013
01:17:28.387 --> 01:17:31.123
I saw his arrival on
the overland from the parlor.

1014
01:17:32.324 --> 01:17:35.227
It cost me a difficult moment.

1015
01:17:35.261 --> 01:17:37.997
But I'm fine, Mr. Borlund.
Thank you for your concern.

1016
01:17:41.167 --> 01:17:42.668
Just a moment.

1017
01:17:51.944 --> 01:17:54.246
My last will and testament.

1018
01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.949
My lawyer's name is on
the front of the envelope.

1019
01:17:56.982 --> 01:17:59.718
To be delivered
in the event of my death.

1020
01:18:17.503 --> 01:18:19.104
Yeah.

1021
01:18:19.138 --> 01:18:20.739
Must be getting me out of here.

1022
01:18:20.773 --> 01:18:22.741
You know, I figured Tiberio

1023
01:18:22.775 --> 01:18:26.745
would see the light.
Me and him, we got business.

1024
01:18:32.818 --> 01:18:34.720
Hello, Elijah.

1025
01:18:36.055 --> 01:18:37.456
Mr. Kidd.

1026
01:18:39.892 --> 01:18:41.427
Now, uh...

1027
01:18:44.396 --> 01:18:46.966
I can't say I expected you
to come down here.

1028
01:18:46.999 --> 01:18:49.401
No small talk, Elijah.

1029
01:18:49.435 --> 01:18:51.136
It's time to pay you off.

1030
01:18:54.039 --> 01:18:55.841
You gonna shoot an unarmed man?

1031
01:18:55.874 --> 01:18:57.776
Yeah.

1032
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:06.819
Put a gun in his hand.

1033
01:19:06.852 --> 01:19:08.887
You open that cell door.

1034
01:19:09.589 --> 01:19:11.290
He was trying to escape.

1035
01:19:36.115 --> 01:19:37.182
He was dead

1036
01:19:37.216 --> 01:19:39.018
when he fell to the floor
of his cell.

1037
01:19:41.387 --> 01:19:42.921
Poor Elijah.

1038
01:19:57.369 --> 01:20:00.005
Ah, Mr. Borlund. I expect
you've heard the news.

1039
01:20:00.039 --> 01:20:03.909
US Army Private Elijah Jones
is no longer a problem.

1040
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:07.212
How much did it cost
Mr. Kidd to commit this murder?

1041
01:20:07.246 --> 01:20:09.315
I'm investigating
these circumstances.

1042
01:20:09.348 --> 01:20:11.518
I am confused, Mr. Borlund.

1043
01:20:11.551 --> 01:20:13.319
Who do you think
you're working for?

1044
01:20:13.352 --> 01:20:16.121
I work for myself.
Always have.

1045
01:20:16.889 --> 01:20:18.424
I was dishonored.

1046
01:20:18.457 --> 01:20:20.859
A wife is not supposed
to run away from her husband

1047
01:20:20.893 --> 01:20:22.361
with a common soldier.

1048
01:20:22.394 --> 01:20:24.430
You mean common Black soldiers?

1049
01:20:25.497 --> 01:20:27.567
Yeah, that's exactly
what I mean.

1050
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.203
Common... Black... soldiers.

1051
01:20:32.204 --> 01:20:34.006
I tell you again,
I'm investigating...

1052
01:21:33.132 --> 01:21:35.467
I'd like to see
my wife, Mrs. Rachel Kidd.

1053
01:21:35.501 --> 01:21:37.903
Can you tell me her room number?

1054
01:21:39.071 --> 01:21:40.939
She's in number 4.

1055
01:21:40.973 --> 01:21:42.542
Up the stairs.

1056
01:22:06.331 --> 01:22:07.933
Martin.

1057
01:22:10.570 --> 01:22:15.240
I am, uh... a bit slow
on coming to see you.

1058
01:22:15.274 --> 01:22:17.242
Of course, there's no point
in pretending

1059
01:22:17.276 --> 01:22:20.513
that there's any affection
between us, is there?

1060
01:22:20.547 --> 01:22:23.115
No. None at all.

1061
01:22:25.217 --> 01:22:26.619
I take it you owe Mr. Borlund

1062
01:22:26.653 --> 01:22:29.021
a great deal of money
for finding me.

1063
01:22:29.054 --> 01:22:31.223
Mr. Borlund will receive
what he's earned.

1064
01:22:31.256 --> 01:22:34.460
Just like Elijah?
Did he receive what he earned?

1065
01:22:34.493 --> 01:22:37.229
Uh, no. I was too good to him.
He died a quick death.

1066
01:22:37.262 --> 01:22:39.431
You are despicable, Martin.

1067
01:22:42.468 --> 01:22:44.002
You're breaking marriage vows.

1068
01:22:44.036 --> 01:22:46.171
You run away with
an army deserter

1069
01:22:46.205 --> 01:22:49.576
who's also a criminal low-life
demanding ransom money

1070
01:22:49.609 --> 01:22:51.443
for your services to him
as a whore.

1071
01:22:51.477 --> 01:22:54.279
You come very close
to jeopardizing my future

1072
01:22:54.313 --> 01:22:56.381
political career
with this lurid scandal,

1073
01:22:56.415 --> 01:22:59.318
and then you tell me
that I'm despicable?

1074
01:22:59.351 --> 01:23:00.486
I was stupid.

1075
01:23:01.386 --> 01:23:03.088
I made bad situations worse

1076
01:23:03.121 --> 01:23:04.724
which caused terrible
things to happen.

1077
01:23:04.757 --> 01:23:06.526
I have no excuse.

1078
01:23:06.559 --> 01:23:08.060
You just wanted legitimacy

1079
01:23:08.093 --> 01:23:09.762
and the security
of my future inheritance.

1080
01:23:09.796 --> 01:23:11.163
We never loved each other.

1081
01:23:11.196 --> 01:23:12.632
- Hmm.
- It was all just

1082
01:23:12.665 --> 01:23:14.266
mutual convenience.

1083
01:23:14.299 --> 01:23:16.636
I intend to return to Santa Fe

1084
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:19.438
where the story'll be put out
in the newspapers

1085
01:23:19.471 --> 01:23:22.174
how I killed my wife's abductor
in a heroic act,

1086
01:23:22.207 --> 01:23:24.309
but that she was unfortunately
captured and killed

1087
01:23:24.343 --> 01:23:26.478
by a gang of Mexican outlaws,

1088
01:23:26.513 --> 01:23:29.281
killed after, you know,
being used by them

1089
01:23:29.314 --> 01:23:31.584
in the lowest possible ways.

1090
01:23:31.618 --> 01:23:32.585
Good story.

1091
01:23:32.619 --> 01:23:34.186
Sad thing is a lot of people

1092
01:23:34.219 --> 01:23:35.387
will probably believe it.

1093
01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.789
It's gonna be quite close
to the truth.

1094
01:23:36.823 --> 01:23:39.358
Given your appetite,
you might enjoy being fucked

1095
01:23:39.391 --> 01:23:43.696
up, down and sideways by those
<i>vaqueros</i> before they kill you.

1096
01:23:43.730 --> 01:23:45.330
They will of course kill you.

1097
01:23:45.364 --> 01:23:49.669
No, it's part of my
understanding with SeÃ±or Vargas.

1098
01:23:50.537 --> 01:23:53.338
- You think I'll go willingly?
- Oh no.

1099
01:23:54.172 --> 01:23:57.677
But these men are quite
happy to use force.

1100
01:23:57.710 --> 01:23:59.812
And you have nowhere to hide.

1101
01:24:01.848 --> 01:24:06.251
I'll leave you now
to think about your future.

1102
01:24:08.487 --> 01:24:11.156
I don't think it's going
to work out the way you want.

1103
01:24:13.793 --> 01:24:15.762
You won't do it.

1104
01:24:15.795 --> 01:24:18.430
You don't actually
have the nerve to kill a man.

1105
01:24:18.463 --> 01:24:20.098
I've changed.

1106
01:24:20.132 --> 01:24:22.835
And you always underestimate me.

1107
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:26.573
I repeat... You won't do...

1108
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:52.599
I heard a shot!
Are you...

1109
01:24:55.334 --> 01:24:57.302
I've killed my husband.

1110
01:25:00.272 --> 01:25:02.575
Well, you gave him
what he deserved.

1111
01:25:02.609 --> 01:25:04.476
He killed Elijah.

1112
01:25:05.912 --> 01:25:07.379
Yes.

1113
01:25:09.281 --> 01:25:10.883
I'm not sorry.

1114
01:26:33.966 --> 01:26:35.835
Knock next time!

1115
01:28:37.890 --> 01:28:39.058
I assume...

1116
01:28:39.826 --> 01:28:41.994
...you intend to defend
Mrs. Kidd?

1117
01:28:42.028 --> 01:28:44.030
And I imagine you have
a nice safe spot

1118
01:28:44.063 --> 01:28:45.665
picked out for yourself.

1119
01:28:45.698 --> 01:28:47.667
I will ignore your insult.

1120
01:28:48.634 --> 01:28:50.670
And I promise you
I will do my duty today

1121
01:28:50.703 --> 01:28:51.971
as an officer of the law.

1122
01:28:52.004 --> 01:28:54.574
Just like you did
with Elijah Jones?

1123
01:28:55.174 --> 01:28:56.976
That was my mistake.

1124
01:28:57.677 --> 01:29:00.613
I should have realized Mr. Kidd
intended to kill Elijah.

1125
01:29:01.714 --> 01:29:03.381
He bribed my deputy.

1126
01:29:05.985 --> 01:29:07.419
I am ashamed.

1127
01:33:01.387 --> 01:33:03.222
I'm taking you out, mister.

1128
01:33:03.255 --> 01:33:05.791
Alright then, go ahead and try.

1129
01:34:32.278 --> 01:34:34.413
I thought
that you were smarter...

1130
01:34:37.116 --> 01:34:39.351
...than getting
in the middle of this.

1131
01:34:50.362 --> 01:34:53.065
Ride out of here
before I decide to shoot you.

1132
01:34:53.766 --> 01:34:55.801
I thank you for your
courtesy and kindness.

1133
01:35:28.568 --> 01:35:30.269
Tiberio Vargas!

1134
01:35:52.224 --> 01:35:53.792
Yah!

1135
01:36:14.079 --> 01:36:15.447
Tiberio!

1136
01:36:16.015 --> 01:36:17.416
Just want to tell you,

1137
01:36:17.449 --> 01:36:19.485
since I'm not working
for you anymore,

1138
01:36:19.519 --> 01:36:22.087
I think you're shit.

1139
01:36:22.121 --> 01:36:23.523
Always did.

1140
01:36:36.101 --> 01:36:37.403
Guess what?

1141
01:36:37.436 --> 01:36:39.572
I did you a favor, bounty man.

1142
01:36:39.606 --> 01:36:43.342
You're gonna thank me
for killing my old boss?

1143
01:36:45.244 --> 01:36:47.913
He was gonna spoil
my fun with you.

1144
01:36:50.416 --> 01:36:52.885
About time you did
something good.

1145
01:37:01.661 --> 01:37:03.962
You know, you can
ride out of here, Joe.

1146
01:37:06.031 --> 01:37:08.233
I took his money.

1147
01:37:08.267 --> 01:37:10.002
Maybe ought to earn it.

1148
01:37:11.203 --> 01:37:14.239
Besides, there's no avoiding it.

1149
01:37:15.207 --> 01:37:17.343
You and me got a reckoning.

1150
01:37:17.376 --> 01:37:21.213
I'm giving you a clean start.
Don't be a damn fool!

1151
01:37:21.246 --> 01:37:23.282
Amigo...

1152
01:37:23.315 --> 01:37:25.250
I was born a fool.

1153
01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:35.260
I'll be a son of a bitch.

1154
01:37:36.962 --> 01:37:38.430
You killed me.

1155
01:37:43.603 --> 01:37:45.270
Luck ran out.

1156
01:37:47.206 --> 01:37:49.141
I'm just dying.

1157
01:37:52.077 --> 01:37:54.113
Happens to us all.

1158
01:37:54.146 --> 01:37:55.314
Don't it?

1159
01:38:20.973 --> 01:38:22.274
Mr. Poe.

1160
01:38:24.276 --> 01:38:26.311
Mr. Borlund.

1161
01:38:33.252 --> 01:38:35.454
I'm gonna make sure
that your body gets sent

1162
01:38:35.487 --> 01:38:38.223
back to the army. They'll give
you a proper finish,

1163
01:38:38.257 --> 01:38:40.225
bugle, flags...

1164
01:38:40.259 --> 01:38:41.628
A man can do worse.

1165
01:38:41.661 --> 01:38:43.596
Goddammit. I...

1166
01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:45.565
I've been shot,
but I ain't dying.

1167
01:38:46.699 --> 01:38:49.602
Just make sure the damn doctor
don't cut my arm off.

1168
01:38:50.436 --> 01:38:52.337
Yeah, you have my word.

1169
01:39:05.184 --> 01:39:07.085
Your husband's dead.

1170
01:39:09.455 --> 01:39:12.458
He was obviously shot
by Tiberio's men.

1171
01:39:16.261 --> 01:39:19.031
You really think
the truth won't come out?

1172
01:39:20.265 --> 01:39:21.534
Who's to ask?

1173
01:39:22.501 --> 01:39:24.136
Well, who is to tell?

1174
01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:31.176
Oh, you need that looked after.

1175
01:39:31.210 --> 01:39:33.145
It's gonna take a few stitches.

1176
01:39:34.581 --> 01:39:37.349
I'll wear my scar
as a badge of honor.

1177
01:39:38.417 --> 01:39:40.352
Mm-hmm.

1178
01:39:43.121 --> 01:39:44.691
I need a drink.
