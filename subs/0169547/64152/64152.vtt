{1747}{1798}Pull yourself together Teddy!
{1799}{1902}Pull yourself together!
{1961}{2045}It's just water.
{2046}{2142}It's a lot of water.
{2246}{2313}Come on.
{2838}{2968}- You okay boss?|- Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just can't
{2969}{3085}I just can't stomach the water.
{3086}{3190}- So you're my new partner?|- That's right.
{3191}{3258}Not the best way to meet with my head|halfway down the toilet.
{3259}{3349}Doesn't exactly square with Teddy Daniels:|The man. The legend. I'll give you that.
{3350}{3398}The Legend?
{3399}{3453}What the hell are you boys smoking|out there in Portland anyway?
{3454}{3495}Seattle.
{3496}{3599}I came from the office in Seattle.
{3600}{3648}How long have you been with Marshals?
{3649}{3723}Four years.
{3732}{3846}- So you know how small it is?|- Sure
{3847}{3941}What about you? You got a girl? Married?
{3942}{4004}I was.
{4254}{4298}She died.
{4299}{4414}- Jesus... I didn't...|- Don't worry about it.
{4415}{4491}There was a fire at the apartment|building while I was at work
{4492}{4536}Four People died.
{4537}{4616}It was the smoke that got her|not the fire. So...
{4617}{4674}- So that's important.|- I'm sorry Boss.
{4675}{4776}Where are my goddamn cigarettes?
{4777}{4806}Well here. Have one of mine.
{4807}{4889}I could of sworn they were in my jacket|when I got on.
{4890}{5011}Government employees will rob you blind.
{5012}{5068}Thanks.
{5069}{5127}They give you a briefing|about the institution before you left?
{5128}{5223}All I know is it's a mental hospital.
{5224}{5294}For the criminally insane.
{5295}{5346}Well, if it was just folks running around,|hearing voices,
{5347}{5522}and chasing after butterflies,|they wouldn't need us.
{5654}{5729}- That's where we're headed?|- Yup.
{5730}{5790}The other side of the|island is rock bluffs
{5791}{5852}all the way down to the edge|of the water.
{5853}{5952}The dock, it's the|only way on...or off.
{5953}{6032}We will be casting off as soon as|you two are ashore.
{6033}{6094}I'd appreciate if you'd|hurry up about it.
{6095}{6200}- Why?|- Storm's coming.
{6796}{6910}I've never seen a marshal's|badge before.
{6911}{6947}I'm Deputy Warden|McPherson, gentlemen.
{6948}{7166}Welcome to Shutter Island.|I'll be the one taking you up to Ashecliffe.
{7348}{7417}Your boys seem a little on edge|Mr. McPherson.
{7418}{7540}Right now, Marshal. We all are.
{7893}{8070}"Remember us for we too have|lived, loved and laughed"
{8529}{8623}Electrified perimeter.
{8624}{8683}How could you tell?
{8684}{8816}I've seen something like it before.
{9424}{9511}All right. You gentlemen will be accorded|all the help we can give.
{9512}{9625}But during the stay you will|obey protocol. Is that understood?
{9626}{9671}Absolutely.
{9672}{9753}The red brick bulding on my right|is ward A, the male ward.
{9754}{9825}Ward B, the female ward, is the one|on the left.
{9826}{9950}Ward C is that building on the bluffs.|An old civil war fort.
{9951}{10008}The most dangerous patients|are housed there.
{10009}{10111}Admittance to ward C is forbidden without|the written consent and
{10112}{10180}physical presence of both|myself and Dr. Cawly.
{10181}{10250}Is that understood?
{10251}{10379}You act like insanity is catching.
{10380}{10494}You are hereby required to surrending|your firearms.
{10495}{10577}Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed|federal marshals.
{10578}{10637}We are required to carry our|firearms with us at all times.
{10638}{10710}Executive order 319 of the Federal Code of|Penitentiaries states that:
{10711}{10762}when inside the penitentiary
{10763}{10912}the offices of that institution|have final authority.
{10913}{11117}Gentlemen, you will not get through|this gate with your firearms.
{11470}{11554}Okay. Now that the official stuff is done,|come on boys.
{11555}{11694}What do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?
{11893}{11959}So when did she escape? This prisoner?
{11960}{12034}I'm afraid that Dr. Cawley will have to|fill you in on the situation.
{12035}{12062}Protocol.
{12063}{12116}Correctional officers at|a mental institution.
{12117}{12174}That's a weird sight,|if you don't mind me saying
{12175}{12227}It's the only facility of it's kind in the U.S.|Even in the world.
{12228}{12317}We take only the|most dangerous, damaged patients.
{12318}{12412}Ones no other hospital can manage.|And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.
{12413}{12684}He's created something really unique here.|It's a hospital for people our society normally...
{13221}{13307}ID's, gentlemen.
{13351}{13395}Show your badges, gentlemen.
{13396}{13450}Dr. Cawley's been consulted|numerous times
{13451}{13552}- By Scotland Yard, MI5, the OSS...|- Why?
{13553}{13642}What do you mean?
{13648}{13735}What do intelligence agencies want|to consult a psychatrist about?
{13736}{13858}I guess you'll have to ask him.
{14019}{14080}- Marshal Daniels.|- Doctor.
{14081}{14130}Marshal Aule.
{14131}{14232}- Thank you deputy warden, that will be all.|- Yes, sir.
{14233}{14300}Pleasure, gentlemen.
{14301}{14343}He had a lot to say about you.
{14344}{14418}McPherson is a good man.|He believes in the work we do here.
{14419}{14477}And what would that be exactly?
{14478}{14563}A moral fusion between law and|order and clinical care.
{14564}{14722}Pardon me Doc...|a what between what and what?
{14801}{14877}Those paintings are quite accurate.
{14878}{14946}It used to be that the kind of patients we|deal with here
{14947}{15011}were shackled and left|in their own filth.
{15012}{15096}They were beaten. As if whipping|them bloody would drive the psychosis out.
{15097}{15254}We drove screws into their brains. We submerged|them in icy water until they lost consciousness.
{15255}{15301}Or even drown.
{15302}{15351}- And now?|- We treat them.
{15352}{15411}Try to heal, try to cure.
{15412}{15523}And if this fails, at least we provide them|with a measure of comfort in their lives. Calm.
{15524}{15571}These are...
{15572}{15628}all violent offenders, right?
{15629}{15681}They've hurt people.
{15682}{15776}- Murdered them in some cases.|- In almost all cases. Yes.
{15777}{15914}Then personally Doctor, I'd have to|say... screw their sense of calm.
{15915}{16008}It's my job to treat my patients not|their victims. I'm not here to judge.
{16009}{16094}- So this female prisoner...|- Patient.
{16095}{16206}Excuse me, patient.|One Rachel Solando,
{16207}{16271}- Escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.
{16272}{16321}Last night, between 10 and midnight.
{16322}{16401}- Is she considered dangerous?|- You could say that.
{16402}{16461}She killed all three of her children.
{16462}{16536}She drowned them in the|lake behind her house.
{16537}{16618}She took them out one by one and held their|heads under until they died.
{16619}{16704}Then she brought them back inside and|arranged them around the kitchen table.
{16705}{16808}She ate a meal there|before a neighbor dropped by.
{16809}{16846}And what about the husband?
{16847}{16956}He died. On the beaches of Normandy.|She is a war widow.
{16957}{17209}She starved herself when first she came here.|She insisted the children weren't dead.
{17316}{17425}- Sorry doctor. You wouldn't happen to have an aspirin? Do you?|- Prone to headaches marshal.
{17426}{17470}Sometimes, but today...
{17471}{17547}- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.|- Ah, Dehydration...
{17548}{17587}- You alright boss?|- Yes.
{17588}{17662}In that case you're quite right.|The simpler the better.
{17663}{17709}Thank you so much.
{17710}{17807}Rachel still believes|her children are alive.
{17808}{17922}She also believes this place is her home|in the Berckshires.
{17923}{17947}You're kidding me.
{17948}{18023}She's never once in two years acknowledged|that she is in an institution.
{18024}{18057}She believes we're all...
{18058}{18117}deliveryman, milkman, postal workers.
{18118}{18228}To sustain the illusion that her children never died,|she's created an elaborate fictional structure.
{18229}{18330}She gives us all parts|to play in that fiction.
{18331}{18438}- So have you searched the grounds yet?|- The warden and his men scoured the island,
{18439}{18492}not a trace.
{18493}{18602}What's more disturbing is, we don't know|how she got out of her room.
{18603}{18659}It was locked from the outside
{18660}{18767}and the only window is barred.
{18768}{18943}It's as if she evaporated straight|through the walls.
{18988}{19082}Brought her right back here after|group therapy, locked her in
{19083}{19251}I came back for a midnight round|and she was gone.
{19314}{19418}Seriously doctor, how is it possible|that the truth never gets through to her?
{19419}{19491}I mean, she's in a|mental institution, right?
{19492}{19541}Seems like something you'd|notice from time to time.
{19542}{19628}- How many pairs of shoes are the patients given?|- Two pairs.
{19629}{19681}Sanity is not a choice, marshal,
{19682}{19748}You can't just choose to get over it.
{19749}{19843}So... she left here barefoot?
{19844}{19944}Come on Doc, she couldn't get ten|yards in that terrain.
{19945}{20012}Marshal?
{20427}{20478}Well this is definitely Rachel's|handwriting.
{20479}{20589}- I have no idea what the "law of 4" is, though.|- It's not a psychiatric term?
{20590}{20619}I'm afraid not.
{20620}{20685}Who's 67?
{20686}{20713}Fuck if I know!
{20714}{20793}I'd have to say that's quite|close to my clinical conclusion.
{20794}{20853}So you think it's|random scribblings?
{20854}{20948}Oh no, not at all. Rachel is smart.|Brilliant in fact.
{20949}{21023}- This paper could be important.|- Excuse me Doctor, but...
{21024}{21131}- We're gonna have to hold onto this.|- Of course.
{21132}{21203}And you say she had|to come through here.
{21204}{21300}After lights out, the orderlies play|cards in here.
{21301}{21425}Last night there were 7 men sitting|at the base of those stairs playing stud poker.
{21426}{21516}Yet somehow, Rachel managed|to slip past them.
{21517}{21563}Why?
{21564}{21625}How? She turns invisible?
{21626}{21705}Doctor, we're gonna need access to personnel files|of all the medical staff.
{21706}{21752}The nurses, the guards, the orderlies.
{21753}{21836}- Anyone who was working then.|- We'll take your request under consideration.
{21837}{21909}This is not a request, Doctor.
{21910}{21970}This is a federal facility|and a dangerous prisoner...
{21971}{22027}- Patient.|- Patient...
{22028}{22134}- has escaped now. You will comply...|- All I can say is that I will see what I can do.
{22135}{22264}Doctor, we're gonna need to speak with the staff,|do you understand?
{22265}{22342}I'll assemble them in the|common room after dinner.
{22343}{22592}If you have any further questions feel|free to join the deputy warden in the search.
{22750}{22832}It's 11 miles to the nearest land|and the water is freezing.
{22833}{22909}The current was strong last night.|The tide pushing in.
{22910}{23094}She'd have drowned or been crushed on the|rocks, and her body would have washed back up onshore.
{23095}{23172}What about those caves down there,|have you checked them?
{23173}{23236}No way she could get there.
{23237}{23334}The base of those cliffs are covered|in poison ivy, live oak, sumac
{23335}{23419}and a thousand plants with thorns|as big as my dick.
{23420}{23585}You said it yourself marshal,|she's got no shoes.
{23623}{23762}All right!|Let's check the other side!
{23812}{23905}- What's that tower?|- It's an old lighthouse.
{23906}{24015}The guards already searched inside it.
{24016}{24127}- What's in there? More patients?|- Sewage treatment facility.
{24128}{24185}It's getting dark soon.
{24186}{24227}I'm calling this off for the night.
{24228}{24312}Let's go, boys!
{24366}{24418}- You were on watch on the landing, huh?|- Yeah.
{24419}{24535}Can't nobody get in or out of their room|in that corridor without me seeing.
{24536}{24580}Okay, Rachel Solando,
{24581}{24744}who else does she have to pass|to get down here?
{24796}{24835}Me.
{24836}{24885}Glen Miga.
{24886}{24987}- Sir, I didn't see nothing.|- And you were at your post all night?
{24988}{25099}Yes. But I didn't see a thing.
{25100}{25160}Glen.
{25175}{25235}Glen.
{25256}{25347}Tell me the truth.
{25408}{25465}I maybe... went to the bathroom.
{25466}{25602}- What? You breached protocol? Christ...|- I wasn't gone more than a minute.
{25603}{25670}All right, let's back up here.|Let's all just back up.
{25671}{25755}Miss Solando was put in|her room for lights out.
{25756}{25830}Does anybody here know|what she did before that?
{25831}{25890}Anyone?
{25891}{25968}Come on. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone.
{25969}{26060}She was in a group therapy session.
{26061}{26120}Huh. Did anything unusual occur?
{26121}{26178}Define "unusual".
{26179}{26256}- Excuse me.|- It's a mental institution, marshal.
{26257}{26306}For criminally insane.
{26307}{26401}"Usual", isn't a big part of our day.
{26402}{26449}I will rephrase.
{26450}{26541}Did anything happen last night|during group therapy, that was more...
{26542}{26616}- let's say, more memorable than...|- Normal?
{26617}{26654}Exactly!
{26655}{26711}No. I'm sorry.
{26712}{26813}Did Mrs. Solando say anything|during group therapy?
{26814}{26888}She was worried about the rain.
{26889}{26941}And she hated the food here.
{26942}{27051}Complained constantly.|Last night included.
{27052}{27136}So... you were there.|Was there a doctor present?
{27137}{27226}Yes. Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.
{27227}{27286}Dr. Sheehan?
{27287}{27376}Yes. He was running the session.
{27377}{27416}He's Rachels's "primary".
{27417}{27536}The psychaiatrist who directly|oversees her care.
{27537}{27594}We're gonna need to|speak with Dr. Sheehan.
{27595}{27656}I'm afraid that won't be possible.
{27657}{27737}He left on the ferry this morning.|His vacation was already planned.
{27738}{27783}He'd putting it off too long.
{27784}{27841}You're in a state of lockdown.
{27842}{27904}A dangerous patient has escaped
{27905}{28011}and you let her primary doctor|leave on vacation?
{28012}{28120}Of course, he's a doctor.
{28172}{28261}Do you have the phone number for|where he's gone?
{28262}{28341}Hello? Hello?
{28357}{28399}Hello?
{28400}{28459}Is anybody there?
{28460}{28517}I'm sorry sir, but its all down.|All the lines.
{28518}{28557}The storm's hitting the|mainland like a hammer.
{28558}{28672}If you get it working, come find me immediately.|The marshalls need to make an important call.
{28673}{28743}Yes, sir.
{28853}{28924}I'm afraid I have evening|rounds in the wards,
{28925}{28996}But I'll be having drinks and a cigar at|my house around 9
{28997}{29042}If you'd care to drop by
{29043}{29152}Good, we can talk then, right?
{29153}{29273}We have been talking, marshal.
{29603}{29683}Gotta say, I'm thinking I got|into the wrong line of public service.
{29684}{29757}It is a little overwhelming.|it was constructed during the Civil War
{29758}{29926}The same time as the military fort|housing ward C.
{30029}{30117}This is the original commander's quarters.|When Uncle Sam got the bill
{30118}{30158}the commander was court-martialed.
{30159}{30212}I can see why.
{30213}{30292}Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?
{30293}{30348}No.
{30521}{30567}It's Mahler.
{30568}{30622}Quite right, marshal.
{30623}{30817}Forgive me, gentlemen...|My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.
{30904}{31053}"Quartet for Piano and Strings|in A minor"
{31074}{31146}- Your poison, gentlemen?|- Rye, if you've got it.
{31147}{31210}Soda and ice please, thanks.
{31211}{31268}You don't indulge in alcohol?
{31269}{31333}I am surprised.
{31334}{31421}Isn't it common for men in your|profession to imbibe?
{31422}{31530}Common enough.|And yours?
{31539}{31636}- I'm sorry?|- Your profession, doctor. Psychiatry...
{31637}{31728}I've always heard it was overrun|with boozers and drunks.
{31729}{31813}Not that I've noticed.
{31814}{31889}What's that? Iced tea|in your glass there?
{31890}{31938}Excellent marshal.
{31939}{32005}You have outstanding defense mechanisms.
{32006}{32167}You must be quite adept|at interrogations, hmm?
{32299}{32393}Men like you... are my specialty.|You know?
{32394}{32448}Men of violence.
{32449}{32510}That's a hell of an|assumption to make...
{32511}{32635}No assumption. Not at all. You misunderstand|me, I said you are men of violence
{32636}{32740}I'm not accusing you of being violent men.|That's quite different.
{32741}{32865}Please, please, edify us, doctor.
{32866}{32921}You both served overseas.
{32922}{33039}Not much of a stretch, Doc. For all you know,|we were both paper pushers over there
{33040}{33129}No, you were not.
{33460}{33604}Since the schoolyard, neither of|you has ever walked away from a physical conflict.
{33605}{33734}Not because you enjoy it, but because retreat|wasn't something you considered an option.
{33735}{33804}We weren't raised to run, Doc.
{33805}{33896}Ah, yes... Raised.
{33905}{33964}and who raised you, marshal?
{33965}{34020}Me?
{34030}{34095}Wolves.
{34148}{34280}Very impressive defense mechanisms.
{35631}{35753}Do you believe in God, marshal?
{35821}{35912}I'm quite serious.
{35918}{36005}[In German:]|I believe so.
{36006}{36118}Have you ever seen...|a death camp, doctor?
{36119}{36230}[In German:]|a concentration camp
{36231}{36335}Me, I was there|at Dachau camp liberation.
{36336}{36440}Your English is very|good, almost flawless.
{36441}{36573}His English is very good.|You hit the consonants a tad hard, though.
{36574}{36635}You're a German?
{36636}{36815}- Is legal immigration a crime, marshal?|- Oh I don't know doctor, you tell us.
{36816}{36937}Now listen, we're gonne need those files on Sheehan|and the rest of staff as well.
{36938}{37008}No personnel files will be released for you.|Period.
{37009}{37086}- We're gonna need those files.|- Out of the question.
{37087}{37158}Bullshit, out of the question!|Bullshit!
{37159}{37220}Who the hell is in|charge here anyway, huh?
{37221}{37315}Dr. Naehring acts as liaison to|our board of overseers.
{37316}{37367}He relayed your request|and it's been refused.
{37368}{37448}Refused? They don't have the authority|to refuse. And neither do you, sir.
{37449}{37539}Marshal, continue your investigation|and we will do all we can to help.
{37540}{37586}This investigation is over.
{37587}{37645}We're gonna file our reports|and hand it over to...
{37646}{37713}- Hoover's boys.|- Hoover's boys, that's right.
{37714}{37763}We'll be taking the ferry|back in the morning.
{37764}{37848}Come on, Chuck.
{38009}{38083}Nice night.
{38189}{38340}You'll be bunking in|the orderlies quarter.
{38542}{38651}Hey boss?... We really packing it in?
{38652}{38699}Why?
{38700}{38809}I guess, I dunno, I just...|never really quit anything before.
{38810}{38896}We haven't heard the|truth once yet, Chuck.
{38897}{39041}Listen. Rachel Solando did not slip out of|a locked cell barefoot without any help.
{39042}{39091}I think she had a lot of help.
{39092}{39154}Maybe Cawley's sitting up in his mansion|right now,
{39155}{39244}rethinking his whole attitude.
{39245}{39337}- Maybe in the morning...|- You're bluffing?
{39338}{39429}I didn't say that.
{39830}{39906}I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.
{39907}{39976}Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?
{39977}{40092}I killed a lot of people in the war.
{40093}{40194}Is that why you drink?
{40207}{40264}Are you real?
{40265}{40320}No.
{40397}{40449}She's still here.
{40450}{40504}Who?
{40505}{40570}Rachel?
{40580}{40664}She never left.
{40940}{41050}Remember when we stayed in the cabin|in the summer, Teddy?
{41051}{41140}We were so happy.
{41146}{41185}She's here.
{41186}{41272}You can't leave.
{41536}{41618}I'm not gonna leave.
{41619}{41713}I love you so much.
{41771}{41890}- I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.|- No.
{41891}{41951}I am.
{42001}{42078}You have to wake up.
{42079}{42140}I won't go.
{42141}{42218}You're here.
{42226}{42282}I'm not.
{42283}{42384}You have to face that.
{42396}{42470}But she is.
{42479}{42558}And so is he.
{42571}{42629}Who?
{42651}{42718}Laeddis.
{42801}{42880}I have to go.
{42924}{42982}No! Please...just let me hold you.
{42983}{43043}- Just a little bit longer.|- Oh, Teddy...
{43044}{43125}You have to let me go.
{43126}{43193}I can't.
{43934}{44071}Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.
{44090}{44131}Doctor.
{44132}{44183}Doctor, doctor.
{44184}{44258}We need to interview the patients who|were in Rachel's group therapy session.
{44259}{44303}I thought your|investigation was finished?
{44304}{44376}It's not like we can take the ferry.
{44377}{44486}Now was Rachel receiving any|other treatment for her illnesses?
{44487}{44569}Do you know the state of the|mental health field these days, gentlemen?
{44570}{44626}No. Not a clue doctor.
{44627}{44658}War.
{44659}{44728}The old school believes in|surgical intervention.
{44729}{44862}Psychosurgery.|Procedures like the trans-orbital lobotomy.
{44863}{44995}Some say the patients become reasonable, docile.|Others say they become zombies.
{44996}{45047}- And the new school?|- Psycho pharmacology.
{45048}{45104}A new drug has just been|approved called Thorazine.
{45105}{45141}Which relaxes psychotic patients.
{45142}{45187}You could say it tames them.
{45188}{45245}- And which school are you in, Doc?|- Me?
{45246}{45328}I have this radical idea that if you treat a|patient with respect,
{45329}{45374}listen to him,
{45375}{45531}try and understand,|you just might reach him.
{45578}{45638}- These patients?|- Even these.
{45639}{45702}What should be a last resort is|becoming a first response.
{45703}{45794}Give them a pill, put them in a corner,|and it all goes away.
{45795}{45857}Rachel Solando was on|a combination of drugs
{45858}{45973}meant to keep her from becoming violent,|but it was only intermittently effective.
{45974}{46097}The greatest obstacle to her recovery was|her refusal to face what she had done.
{46098}{46145}"Was."
{46146}{46329}Is there a reason you keep referring to|your patient in the past tense, doctor?
{46330}{46392}Look outside, marshal.
{46393}{46482}Why do you think?
{46582}{46676}Next up is Peter Breen. Assaulted|his father's nurse with a broken glass.
{46677}{46765}Nurse survived, but|her face permaanently disfigured.
{46766}{46803}I can't wait.
{46804}{46880}She'd smiles at me.|She was so sweet.
{46881}{47000}But... I could see it in her eyes.|She liked to be naked.
{47001}{47068}To suck cock.
{47069}{47122}Okay, Mr. Breen.
{47123}{47208}And then she asked me if she can have|a glass of water?
{47209}{47297}Alone in the kitchen?|Like that's no big deal?
{47298}{47378}- Why was that a big deal?|- It was obvious.
{47379}{47522}She wanted me to pull out my thing so she|could laugh at it.
{47523}{47595}Mr. Breen,
{47604}{47720}we need to ask you some questions, okay?
{47721}{47817}When I cut her she screamed
{47818}{47860}But...
{47861}{47905}She scared me.
{47906}{47960}What did she expect?
{47961}{48015}Interesting.
{48016}{48100}But we are here to talk|Rachel Solando, okay?
{48101}{48153}Rachel Solando...
{48154}{48207}Did you know she had|drowned her own kids?
{48208}{48262}She drowned her kids!
{48263}{48340}This is a sick fucking world|we live in. I'll tell you that...
{48341}{48378}You know what? They should be gassed.
{48379}{48465}All of them... the retards, the killers
{48466}{48625}the niggers. You kill your own kid?|Gas the bitch!
{48626}{48710}Would you... stop that?
{48711}{48770}- A nurse?|- Please. Stop that.
{48771}{48879}A nurse maybe. Maybe she had kids, huh?
{48880}{48954}A husband...
{48955}{49041}Just trying to make ends meet,
{49042}{49116}to lead a normal life...
{49117}{49179}And it says in your file that uh...
{49180}{49296}You tore her face off, didn't you?
{49297}{49434}Congratulations, no more normal|for her, not ever again, no.
{49435}{49561}Do you know what she was afraid of?
{49562}{49586}You.
{49587}{49683}Could you stop that, please?!
{49684}{49741}Stop that!
{49742}{49786}Please... stop!
{49787}{49916}You know a patient by the|name of Andrew Laeddis?
{49917}{50042}- I want to go back.|- Take him!
{50372}{50418}I'll never get out of here.
{50419}{50501}I'm not sure that I should.
{50502}{50543}Excuse me for saying this,
{50544}{50594}- Miss Kearns...|- Misses.
{50595}{50666}Mrs. Kearns.
{50667}{50716}But you seem...
{50717}{50759}quite normal,...
{50760}{50818}I mean in comparison|with the other patients here.
{50819}{50934}Well, I have my dark days|I suppose everybody does.
{50935}{51069}The difference is that most people don't kill|their husbands with an axe.
{51070}{51159}Although personally I think if a|man beats you and fucks
{51160}{51272}half the women he sees|and no one will help you,
{51273}{51395}axing him isn't the least understandable|thing you can do.
{51396}{51470}Maybe you shouldn't get out.
{51471}{51524}And what would I do if I did?
{51525}{51610}I don't know the world anymore.|They say there are
{51611}{51687}bombs that can reduce whole|cities to ash
{51688}{51762}And what do they call "televisions"...
{51763}{51844}voices and faces coming from a box.
{51845}{51917}I hear enough voices already
{51918}{52041}What can you tell us about Rachel?
{52042}{52140}Um. Not much, she...|she keeps to herself.
{52141}{52224}She believed her kids were alive.
{52225}{52357}She thought she was still living|in the Berkshires and we were all neighbours
{52358}{52465}- The milkman, postmen...|- Deliveryman,
{52466}{52519}And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?
{52520}{52570}Yes. Um.
{52571}{52672}He talked about anger.
{52673}{52730}Tell me about him...
{52731}{52780}What's he like?
{52781}{52872}I think he's uh...
{52906}{52980}Okay... nice.
{52981}{53099}Not hard on the eyes|as my mother would say.
{53100}{53167}Did he ever make a pass at you?
{53168}{53217}No.
{53218}{53373}No, Dr. Sheehan is a good|doctor, he would never...
{53374}{53423}Could I have a glass of water, please?
{53424}{53498}No problem.
{53814}{53908}Thank you, marshal.
{53969}{54123}I have just one more question for you|Mrs. Kearns.
{54124}{54273}Did you ever meet a patient|named Andrew Laeddis?
{54274}{54329}No.
{54334}{54428}Never heard of him.
{54515}{54556}She was coached.
{54557}{54639}She used practically the same words as|Cawley and the nurse.
{54640}{54818}- Like she'd been told exactly what to say.|- Who is Andrew Laeddis?
{54819}{55011}You asked every one of those patients|back there about him. Who is he?
{55012}{55093}What the hell, boss, I'm your partner|for the Christ's sake!
{55094}{55151}We just met, Chuck.
{55152}{55208}You've been on the beat a long time.
{55209}{55298}You got a duty, got a career.|What I'm doing,
{55299}{55385}is not exactly by the book.
{55386}{55623}I don't give a damn about "by the book", boss|I just to know what the hell is going on.
{55624}{55711}When this case came over the wires,
{55712}{55866}- I requested it specifically. Do you understand?|- Why?
{55867}{55929}Andrew Laeddis,
{55930}{56064}was the maintenance man in the apartment|building where my wife and I lived.
{56065}{56125}Okay.
{56140}{56241}He was also a firebug.
{56255}{56372}Andrew Laeddis lit the match,
{56383}{56529}that caused the fire|that killed my wife.
{56647}{56724}Let 'em out!
{56744}{56793}What happened to Laeddis?
{56794}{56901}Got away with it.|Laeddis got away with it and disappeared.
{56902}{56956}About a year ago, I opened up the|newspaper and there he is.
{56957}{57008}He's an ugly looking son of a bitch.
{57009}{57071}He had a new scar from his right temple|down to his left lip.
{57072}{57153}Eyes different colors.|Not the type of face you forget.
{57154}{57229}He'd burned down a|schoolhouse. Killed 2 people.
{57230}{57275}He said voices told him to do it.
{57276}{57340}First he was sent to prison|and then he was transferred here.
{57341}{57392}- Then what?|- Then, nothing.
{57393}{57487}He vanished like he never existed.|No record whatsoever.
{57488}{57551}I'm sure he's not in ward B|that leaves ward C.
{57552}{57580}Or he could be dead.
{57581}{57727}So could Rachel Solando for that matter.|Lot of places to hide a body here.
{57728}{57860}Only one place|no one really knows.
{58072}{58168}That patient, Bridget Kearne,|when she sent me for water,
{58169}{58241}she said something to you|back there, didn't she?
{58242}{58297}No.
{58318}{58397}Come on boss!
{58436}{58515}She wrote it.
{58841}{58882}Boss!
{58883}{58970}We gotta get indoors. It's turning|into fucking Kansas out here...
{58971}{59088}- All right.|- Now. Let's go!
{59090}{59162}Watch out!
{59180}{59242}Jesus!
{59255}{59358}Come on! Let's go back!
{59727}{59828}Jesus Christ!|Damn it!
{60042}{60198}- Are you okay boss?|- Yes. That's all right.
{60278}{60345}So... if Laeddis is here...
{60346}{60452}What are you going to do boss?
{60453}{60570}I'm not here to kill Leaddis.
{60697}{60834}If it was my wife|I'd kill him twice.
{61022}{61231}When we got through the gates of Dachau,|the SS guards surrendered.
{61336}{61500}The commandante tried to kill himself|before we got there...
{61501}{61568}but he botched it.
{61569}{61674}Took him an hour to die.
{61731}{61913}When I went outside,|I saw all the bodies on the ground.
{61930}{62021}Too many to count.
{62614}{62710}Too many to imagine.
{62724}{62789}So yeah
{62814}{63013}The guards surrendered, we took|their guns, we lined them up...
{63965}{64056}It wasn't warfare,
{64062}{64144}it was murder.
{64199}{64315}And I've had enough of killing.
{64316}{64385}That's not why I'm here.
{64386}{64490}So what is this all about?
{64491}{64563}After Laeddis vanished,
{64564}{64663}I started doing some checking|on Ashecliffe.
{64664}{64784}A lot of people knew about this place, but no|one wants to talk...
{64785}{64877}You know? It's like they're|scared of something.
{64878}{64969}You know this place is funded by|a special grant
{64970}{65046}from the House of|Unamerican Activities Committee.
{65047}{65194}HUAC. And how exactly are we fighting|the Commies from an island in Boston Harbor?
{65195}{65289}By conducting experiments on the mind.
{65290}{65325}At least that's my guess.
{65326}{65373}And you think thats going on in here?
{65374}{65428}Like I said, no one would talk, right?
{65429}{65496}Until I found someone|who used to be a patient here.
{65497}{65541}Guy's name is George Noyce.
{65542}{65609}Nice college kid.|Socialist.
{65610}{65693}He gets offered some money to do a|psych study. Guess what they were testing?
{65694}{65773}- Tooth paste?|- So he starts seeing dragons everywhere.
{65774}{65891}Almost beats his professor to death|Ends up here in Ashecliffe.
{65892}{65915}Ward C.
{65916}{65997}They released him after 1 year, right?|What does he do?
{65998}{66136}Two weeks on the mainland he walks into|a bar and stabs three men to death.
{66137}{66205}His lawyer pleads insanity,|but Noyce...
{66206}{66257}Noyce, he stands up in the courtroom and
{66258}{66302}he begs the judge,|for the electric chair.
{66303}{66372}Anywhere but a mental hospital.
{66373}{66462}Judge gives him life in Dedham prison.
{66463}{66561}- And you found him?|- Yeah, I found him.
{66562}{66636}Well, he's a mess
{66637}{66706}- But it's pretty clear from what he tells me, ...|- What?
{66707}{66778}... they're experimenting|on people here.
{66779}{66863}I don't know, boss.
{66864}{66928}- How do you believe a crazy guy?|- That's the beauty of it isn't it?
{66929}{67041}Crazy people are perfect subjects.|They talk, but nobody listens.
{67042}{67083}I stood in Dachau.
{67084}{67212}We saw what human beings are capable|of doing to each other, right?
{67213}{67262}For Christ sake we fought a goddamn war
{67263}{67321}to stop them, and now|I find out it may be happening here?
{67322}{67408}On our soil?|No.
{67416}{67487}So what are you really|here to do, Teddy?
{67488}{67548}I'm gonna get the proof,
{67549}{67650}I'm gonna go back, and blow|the lid off this place.
{67651}{67697}That's it.
{67698}{67759}Wait a minute.
{67760}{67824}You started asking|around about Ashecliffe.
{67825}{67951}Waiting for a chance to get out here|then suddenly they need a US marshal?
{67952}{68020}I got lucky. There was a patient escape,|it was the perfect excuse.
{68021}{68094}No, no, no boss.|Luck doesn't work that way.
{68095}{68207}The world doesn't work that way. They got an|electrified fence around a septic facility.
{68208}{68293}Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?
{68294}{68393}A chief of staff with ties to the OSS|Funding from HUAC?
{68394}{68493}Jesus Christ! Everything about this place|stinks of "government ops".
{68494}{68543}- What If they wanted you here?|- Bullshit.
{68544}{68588}- You were asking questions.|- Bullshit.
{68589}{68716}Bullshit? We came in for Rachel Solando? Where is|one shred of evidence that she even existed?
{68717}{68775}There's no way they could of known I'd be|assigned to this case. No way...
{68776}{68847}While you were looking into them,|they were looking into you.
{68848}{68911}All they need to do|is fake an escape to get you here.
{68912}{69094}And now they have you.|Now they have us both, here, now.
{69096}{69155}Marshal, are you out here?
{69156}{69226}This is deputy warden McPherson.
{69227}{69252}Marshal!
{69253}{69289}How about that? They found us huh.
{69290}{69401}It's an island, boss.|They're always gonna find us.
{69402}{69472}I know you are in there...
{69473}{69541}We're getting off of this Goddamned island.|You and me.
{69542}{69609}Come on!
{69661}{69747}- Come on!|- Go!
{69939}{70031}Get dried off.|Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you. Now!
{70032}{70226}And hurry up, this thing is turning|into a goddamn hurricane!
{70238}{70296}I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
{70297}{70345}It should be ready by tomorrow.
{70346}{70411}That is if we don't all wash away first.
{70412}{70527}Speaking of which, I'm afraid your smokes were|pretty much done for.
{70528}{70588}So...
{70601}{70653}This is our only choice, huh?
{70654}{70731}Got something really nice in prison already|if that don't work for you...
{70732}{70818}Now that you mention|it, these are just fine.
{70819}{70895}That's why I must repeat my insistence|that all ward C patients
{70896}{70948}be placed in manual restraints.
{70949}{71038}If the facility floods, they'll drown.|You know that.
{71039}{71098}- That would take a lot of flooding.|- We are on an island,
{71099}{71141}in the middle of the ocean,|during a hurricane.
{71142}{71196}A lot of flooding seems like a|distinct possibility.
{71197}{71268}It's a gamble, Steven.|Say the power fails, ...
{71269}{71297}There's a backup generator.
{71298}{71392}And if that goes? The cell doors|will open.
{71393}{71451}Where are they going to go?
{71452}{71526}They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over|to the mainland and wreak havoc.
{71527}{71649}You're quite right. They're far more likely|to wreak havoc right here on us.
{71650}{71726}If they're manacled to|the floor, they'll die.
{71727}{71779}That's 24 human beings.
{71780}{71828}You can live with that, can you?
{71829}{71873}Frankly, if it were up to me,
{71874}{71957}I'd put all 42 in wards A and B in|manual restraints as well.
{71958}{72001}Excuse me|Excuse me
{72002}{72089}- Marshal.|- I'm sorry doctor, I just have one quick question.
{72090}{72120}Yes, I will be with you in a moment.
{72121}{72191}We spoke this morning|about Rachel Solando's note.
{72192}{72231}The law of 4, I loved that.
{72232}{72343}You said you had no idea what|that second line could refer to. Correct?
{72344}{72371}Who is 67?
{72372}{72461}Yes, I'm afraid I still don't.|None of us do.
{72462}{72579}Uh huh. Nothing comes to mind.
{72580}{72647}Nothing?
{72704}{72748}Because I believe I just heard|you say there are
{72749}{72830}24 patients in ward C.
{72831}{72897}And 42 of patients, in wards A and B
{72898}{73010}Which means there is a total of what?|66 patients here in this facility.
{73011}{73109}That is correct, yes.
{73122}{73197}Then it seems that|Rachel Solando was suggesting
{73198}{73302}that you have a 67th patient, doctor.
{73303}{73382}- But I'm afraid we don't.|- This is ridiculous.
{73383}{73462}- What are you doing here?|- We are doing our goddamn job.
{73463}{73550}Didn't McPherson tell you the good news?
{73551}{73614}No, what's the good news, doctor?
{73615}{73683}Rachel has been found.
{73684}{73747}She's here.
{73748}{73832}Safe and sound.
{74066}{74179}There is not a mark on her.
{74200}{74291}Who are these men?
{74310}{74355}Why are they in my house?
{74356}{74397}Police officers, Rachel.
{74398}{74515}They... have a few questions.
{74549}{74611}Ma'am.
{74644}{74719}There's been a sighting of a known|Communist
{74720}{74850}subversive in this area|passing out literature
{74851}{74911}Here?
{74936}{74982}In this neighborhood?
{74983}{75049}Yes, I'm afraid so.
{75050}{75148}Now, if you can tell us what you did|yesterday, where you were,
{75149}{75233}it would really help|us narrow our search.
{75234}{75296}Yes...
{75330}{75409}Well, I...umm
{75441}{75542}I made breakfast for Jim|and the children,
{75543}{75622}and then I...
{75627}{75754}I packed Jim's lunch|and he left.
{75765}{75906}Then I sent the children off to school.
{75937}{76011}And then...
{76121}{76270}I decided to take a|long swim in the lake.
{76361}{76428}I see...
{76483}{76567}And after that?
{76710}{76789}After that...
{76969}{77058}I thought of you.
{77158}{77194}I... I'm sorry, ma'am.
{77195}{77327}I don't know what you're talking about.
{77328}{77474}Don't you know how|lonely I've been, Jim?
{77538}{77620}You're gone...
{77665}{77742}You're dead.
{77817}{77908}I cry every night.
{78006}{78120}How am I supposed to survive?
{78121}{78179}God.
{78383}{78505}Rachel... it will be all right.
{78535}{78617}I'm so sorry, but...
{78618}{78733}everything is gonna be all right? Okay?
{78734}{78813}I buried you.
{78819}{78938}I buried an empty casket. Your body|rained down lumps of flesh splashing
{78939}{79056}into the sea eaten by sharks.
{79074}{79217}My Jim is dead,|So who the fuck are you?
{79218}{79280}Who the fuck are you?!
{79281}{79394}Who are you?! Who are you?!
{79577}{79619}I'm sorry about that.
{79620}{79701}I didn't want to interrupt, I thought|she might tell you something, but...
{79702}{79752}we found her down by the lighthouse,
{79753}{79821}skipping stones.
{79822}{79910}We have no idea how she got out there. I'm going|to ask you both to go down into basement.
{79911}{80010}There's food, water, and cots.|It's the safest place to be
{80011}{80116}when the hurricane hits.
{80149}{80198}Are you all right?|You look pale.
{80199}{80274}I'm fine, it's just uh...
{80275}{80341}Boss, are you okay?
{80342}{80399}It's just so Goddamn bright? Isn't it?
{80400}{80511}Photo sensitivity, headaches sometimes?|Marshal are you having a migraine?
{80512}{80598}I'll be alright.
{80703}{80737}What's wrong with him.
{80738}{80757}Take these, marshal.
{80758}{80819}You'll sleep a couple of hours,|wake up clear as a bell.
{80820}{80878}He's having a migraine.|Imagine someone sawed open your head and
{80879}{80929}filled it with razors then shook it|as hard as they could.
{80930}{80966}Take the pills, marshal.
{80967}{81170}- No... I don't want the pills.|- It'll stop the pain. Take the pills.
{81171}{81293}He's going to need to lie down.
{81357}{81422}Oh God!
{81747}{81823}Careful. All right.
{81824}{81922}Gonna be okay. Relax.
{82036}{82105}- Who is that?|- Him?
{82106}{82194}That's the warden.
{82195}{82327}Don't you worry about him, alright?
{82402}{82484}Looks like an ex-military prick.
{82485}{82667}You know what? I ain't gonna argue|with you on that one.
{84607}{84711}You should have saved me.
{84712}{84837}You should have saved all of us.
{85483}{85555}Hey buddy.
{85560}{85589}Hey.
{85590}{85657}Laeddis.
{85660}{85718}Yes.
{85952}{86009}Hi, buddy.
{86010}{86115}No hard feelings, right?
{86217}{86306}No hard feelings.
{86581}{86694}Little something for later.
{86721}{86855}Because I know how much you need it.
{86921}{86988}Clock's ticking, my friend.
{86989}{87099}We're running out of time.
{87272}{87368}Give me a hand here.
{87859}{87967}I could get into trouble.
{88573}{88643}I'm dead?
{88673}{88737}I'm so sorry.
{88738}{88830}Why didn't you save me?
{88831}{88927}I tried, I wanted to,|but by the time I got there,
{88928}{89014}it was too late.
{89512}{89570}See?
{89594}{89695}Aren't they beautiful?
{90942}{91052}Why are you all wet, baby?
{91055}{91129}Laeddis isn't dead.
{91130}{91198}He isn't gone.
{91199}{91285}He's still here.
{91314}{91338}I know.
{91339}{91396}We need to find him, Teddy.
{91397}{91548}You need to find him and|you kill him dead.
{91876}{91962}Shhh. It's okay.
{92203}{92227}Shh. Again!
{92228}{92336}The generator is flooded.
{92391}{92482}Are you okay boss?
{92488}{92534}This goddamn migraine!
{92535}{92669}Back up generators failed.|The whole place has gone crazy.
{92670}{92773}What do you want to do?
{92853}{92885}Christ!
{92886}{92956}No, no, no!|Put it down.
{92957}{93027}Now! Now!
{93241}{93307}You think the whole|electrical system is fried?
{93308}{93381}I'd say that it's a good possibility.
{93382}{93429}All electronic security...
{93430}{93498}fences, gates, the doors
{93499}{93525}Come on.
{93526}{93583}Nice day for a stroll|don't you think?
{93584}{93685}To ward C for example.
{93708}{93842}Maybe we'll run into Andrew Leaddis.
{93881}{93949}The guy I told you about, George Noyce?
{93950}{94018}He told me this is where they keep|the worse ones.
{94019}{94130}The guys even the other inmates|are scared of.
{94131}{94185}Noyce give you anything on the layout?
{94186}{94217}Not really.
{94218}{94310}All that he remembers was people|scream day and night. There were no windows.
{94311}{94424}There were bars everywhere.
{94857}{94910}Jesus Christ!
{94911}{94984}First time|on ward C, right?
{94985}{95025}- Yes, yes...|- Yes.
{95026}{95126}- Yeah, heard stories, but...|- Trust me, sons. You haven't heard shit.
{95127}{95186}We got most of the|bugsies locked down now,
{95187}{95235}But some of them are still loose.
{95236}{95301}If you see one don't try|to restrain him yourselves.
{95302}{95342}These fuckers will kill you.
{95343}{95383}Clear?
{95384}{95535}Alright. Get your asses moving then.|Go on.
{96816}{96888}He's here.
{96940}{96994}Laeddis.
{96995}{97079}I can feel him.
{97123}{97200}Tag! You're it.
{97201}{97259}Ted!
{98557}{98603}Listen to me!
{98604}{98660}Listen!|I do not want to leave, all right?
{98661}{98759}Why would anyone want to?|We hear things here.
{98760}{98822}About the outside world.|About atolls.
{98823}{98887}About the h-bomb tests.
{98888}{98961}You know how|a hydrogen bomb works?
{98962}{99025}- With... Hydrogen?|- That's funny.
{99026}{99105}- Boss!|- Other bombs explode, right?
{99106}{99181}But not the hydrogen bomb|It implodes.
{99182}{99289}Creating an explosion to the thousandth|millionth degree.
{99290}{99335}- Do you get it?|- Yeah. Yeah.
{99336}{99375}- Do you?|- I get it!
{99376}{99448}Let em go!
{99770}{99825}No!
{99845}{99897}What are you doing?
{99898}{99969}Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!
{99970}{99998}You got Billings?
{99999}{100089}What's the fuck's the matter with you guys?|You catch them, not kill them!
{100090}{100113}He jumped us.
{100114}{100204}You, give me a hand with him.|We've got to get him to the infirmary.
{100205}{100225}Goddamnit!
{100226}{100298}No, no! Not you, not you.|Take a walk.
{100299}{100316}Come on!
{100317}{100475}Paula's gonna have my Goddamn|balls for this..
{101133}{101219}{y:i}Laeddis....
{101669}{101755}{y:i}Laeddis....
{102004}{102022}Please...
{102023}{102095}Oh my God!
{102111}{102195}{y:i}Stop me.|Before I kill more.
{102196}{102282}{y:i}Laeddis ...
{102328}{102383}Go!
{102417}{102513}{y:i}Please, please!
{102659}{102745}{y:i}Laeddis ...
{102880}{102967}{y:i}You told me I'd be free of|this place.
{102968}{103050}{y:i}You promised.
{103051}{103094}{y:i}You lied.
{103095}{103162}Laeddis?
{103260}{103327}Laeddis?
{103340}{103425}That's pretty damned funny.
{103426}{103465}Your voice...
{103466}{103506}Don't you recognize it?
{103507}{103568}After all the talks we had?
{103569}{103631}After all the lies you've told me?
{103632}{103683}Let me see your face.
{103684}{103759}They say I'm theirs now.
{103760}{103845}They say I'll never leave here.
{103846}{103958}Your match is about to go out.
{103959}{104011}Let me see your goddamn face now!
{104012}{104035}Why?
{104036}{104095}So you can lie to me more?
{104096}{104153}- This isn't about the truth!|- Yes it is.
{104154}{104245}- It's about exposing the truth.|- This is about you!
{104246}{104311}And Laeddis.
{104312}{104383}That's all it's ever been about.
{104384}{104450}I was incidental.
{104451}{104521}A way in.
{104551}{104593}George?
{104594}{104646}George Noyce?
{104647}{104734}No, it's not possible,|You can't be here.
{104735}{104807}Do you like it?
{104808}{104855}Who did this to you, George?
{104856}{104899}You did!
{104900}{104932}What the hell do you mean?
{104933}{104983}What are you talking|all of your fucking talk
{104984}{105042}And I'm back here because of you!
{105043}{105098}George, I how did they get you out of Dedham.|Huh?
{105099}{105179}However this happened, Im gonna|find a way to fix this. You understand me?
{105180}{105213}I'll never get out now.
{105214}{105280}I got out once, But|not twice, never twice.
{105281}{105364}- Tell me how they got you here?|- They knew!
{105365}{105402}Don't you get it?
{105403}{105485}Everything you were up to.|Your whole plan.
{105486}{105555}This is a game. All of this...
{105556}{105592}is for you.
{105593}{105645}You're not investigating anything.
{105646}{105738}You're a fucking rat|in a maze.
{105739}{105774}George...
{105775}{105841}Gearge you're wrong.
{105842}{105881}Really?
{105882}{105972}Been alone much since|you got here?
{105973}{106025}I'm been with my partner.
{106026}{106117}You have never worked|with him before, have you?
{106118}{106158}He's a...
{106159}{106213}US Marshal from Seattle.
{106214}{106318}You have never worked|with him before, have you?
{106319}{106349}George, look...
{106350}{106475}I know people.|I trust this man.
{106532}{106642}Then, they've already won.
{106644}{106704}Fuck!
{106773}{106837}They're going to...
{106838}{106898}take me to the lighthouse.
{106899}{106976}They're going to|cut into my brain.
{106977}{107084}And I'm only here because of you!
{107085}{107185}George, I'm going to get you out of here.|You're not going to the lighthouse.
{107186}{107206}You're not.
{107207}{107277}You can't dig out the truth and|kill Laeddis at the same time.
{107278}{107361}You've got to make a choice.|You understand that, don't you?
{107362}{107411}I'm not here to kill anyone.
{107412}{107532}- Liar!|- I not gonna kill him! I swear to you ...
{107533}{107592}She's dead.
{107593}{107657}Let her go...
{107658}{107713}Let her go.
{107714}{107759}Tell him Teddy...
{107760}{107839}Tell him why.
{107865}{107931}You've got to do it.|There's no other way.
{107932}{108017}- Let her go.|- Tell him about the day you brought me my locket...
{108018}{108036}You've gotta do it!
{108037}{108145}How I told you my heart was breaking.|And you asked me why?
{108146}{108189}She's fucking with your head.
{108190}{108269}And I told you|it was from happiness.
{108270}{108384}She'll kill you. She's|going to kill you.
{108385}{108482}You want to uncover the truth?|You've gotta let her go ...
{108483}{108562}- I can't.|- You have to let her go!
{108563}{108652}I can't!|I can't.
{108758}{108892}Then you'll never leave|this island.
{108967}{109034}Dolores?
{109166}{109240}He's not in this ward.
{109241}{109296}He was transferred...
{109297}{109373}Out of here.
{109374}{109438}If he's not in ward A,
{109439}{109564}there's only one place he can be
{109616}{109700}The lighthouse.
{109839}{109897}Hey!
{109937}{110016}God help you.
{110179}{110246}Boss, we got problems.|McPherson and Cawley are in the building.
{110247}{110314}They heard an orderly went|batshit on a patient,
{110315}{110382}They're looking all over the place for him.|They're on the way to the roof.
{110383}{110415}Let's get the hell out of here.
{110416}{110486}This way.
{110490}{110612}Just keep going.|We belong here
{110788}{110890}- What happened to you?|- What do you mean?
{110891}{110932}Where were you?
{110933}{110987}After we got that guy to the infirmary,
{110988}{111042}I took a little detour|to patient records.
{111043}{111104}Did you ever find Laeddis?
{111105}{111132}No.
{111133}{111207}- No. I never found him.|- Well I've got the next best thing.
{111208}{111242}His intake form.
{111243}{111310}It was the only thing in his file.|No session notes. No incident reports.
{111311}{111360}No photographs... just this.|It was weird.
{111361}{111422}Here, take a look.
{111423}{111502}I'll look at it later.
{111503}{111545}What's the matter, boss?
{111546}{111659}I'll take a look at it later,|that's all.
{111660}{111695}Ashecliffe's that way.
{111696}{111774}I'm not going to Ashecliffe.
{111775}{111833}I'm going to the lighthouse.
{111834}{112035}I'm going to find out what|the fuck is happening on this island.
{112224}{112266}Here it is.
{112267}{112321}Damn!
{112322}{112379}We're too far South.|We're gonna have to double back.
{112380}{112441}There's no way we could|cross those rocks.
{112442}{112509}There could be a way behind those trees.
{112510}{112556}Maybe a path that goes around the rocks|that leads over to the lighthouse.
{112557}{112636}What are we doing here?|We've got the intake form.
{112637}{112781}It proves there's a 67th patient...|which they've said repeatedly doesn't exist.
{112782}{112896}I'm getting to that lighthouse.|Do you understand?
{112897}{112969}What the hell can I say to you|to stop you?
{112970}{112996}Why would you want to Chuck?|Why?
{112997}{113106}Because climbing down there|when it's dark is a thin step short to suicide. That's why.
{113107}{113135}Okay.
{113136}{113253}Maybe you better sit this one out then.
{113254}{113343}You brought me into this, boss.|And now I am trapped here on this rock.
{113344}{113368}On this island.
{113369}{113461}Without no one to rely on but each other.|And now you're acting like.........
{113462}{113487}Like what? Like what?
{113488}{113574}How am I acting?
{113619}{113796}What the hell happened back there|in those cells, Ted?
{113841}{114010}- What do you think the weather is like in Portland, Chuck?|- I'm from Seattle.
{114011}{114078}Seattle?
{114156}{114257}I'll going on...alone.
{114263}{114301}I'm going with you, boss.
{114302}{114381}I said alone.
{114384}{114444}Fine.
{115037}{115094}Damn it!
{115095}{115162}Damn it!
{115248}{115469}I knew it wouldn't take long.|But I couldn't get to it. The tide was up.
{115552}{115614}Chuck!
{115640}{115702}Chuck!
{117156}{117223}Come on!
{118021}{118062}Chuck!
{118063}{118161}Where are you, Chuck?
{118695}{118757}Chuck!
{118767}{118829}Chuck!
{119868}{119945}Who are you?
{119961}{119995}I'm Teddy Daniels.
{119996}{120050}I'm a cop.
{120051}{120125}You're the marshal.
{120126}{120205}That's right.
{120211}{120238}Would you mind...
{120239}{120306}taking your hand from behind|your back, please?
{120307}{120338}Why?
{120339}{120390}Why?!
{120391}{120568}I want to make sure what you're|holding won't hurt me.
{120639}{120700}I'm gonna keep this...
{120701}{120763}If you don't mind.
{120764}{120838}Fine by me.
{121096}{121176}You're Rachel Solando.
{121177}{121256}The real one.
{121295}{121382}Did you kill your children?
{121383}{121452}I never had children.
{121453}{121529}I was never married.
{121530}{121664}And before I was a patient|in Ashecliff, I worked here.
{121665}{121739}You were a nurse?
{121740}{121845}I was a doctor, marshal.
{121876}{121917}You think I'm crazy?
{121918}{121997}- No, I ...|- And if I say I'm not crazy ...
{121998}{122097}well that hardly helps, does it?
{122098}{122230}That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.
{122253}{122302}People tell the world you're crazy
{122303}{122347}and all your protests to the contrary,
{122348}{122452}just confirms what they're saying.
{122453}{122509}I'm not following you.|I'm sorry.
{122510}{122564}Once you are declared insane,
{122565}{122630}then anything you do is called|a part of that insanity.
{122631}{122722}Your reasonable protests|or denial.
{122723}{122775}Valid fears,|paranoia.
{122776}{122842}Survival instincts.
{122843}{122885}Defense mechanisms.
{122886}{122989}You're smarter than you look marshal.|That's probably not a good thing.
{122990}{123017}Tell me something...
{123018}{123083}Yeah...
{123093}{123152}What happened to you?
{123153}{123239}I started asking about these large|shipments of sodium-anatol
{123240}{123350}- and opium-based hallucinogens.|- Psychotropic drugs.
{123351}{123464}I asked about the surgeries, too.
{123465}{123545}Ever heard of trans-orbital lobotomy?
{123546}{123612}They zap the patient with electroshocks,
{123613}{123732}then go through the eye with an ice pick
{123733}{123847}and pull out some nerve fibers.
{123848}{123903}Makes the patients much more obedient.
{123904}{123970}Tractable.
{123971}{124030}It's barbaric.
{124031}{124087}Unconscionable.
{124088}{124220}Do you know how pain enters the|body marshal? Do you?
{124221}{124277}Depends on where you're hurt.
{124278}{124317}No, it has nothing to do with the flesh.
{124318}{124385}The brain controls pain.
{124386}{124548}The brain controls fear, empathy,|sleep, hunger, anger... everything.
{124549}{124604}What If you could control it?
{124605}{124632}The brain?
{124633}{124691}Re-create a man,
{124692}{124747}so he doesn't feel pain,
{124748}{124838}or love, or sympathy.
{124839}{125005}A man who can't be interrogated|because he has no memories to confess.
{125006}{125058}You can never take away|all a man's memories.
{125059}{125096}Never.
{125097}{125193}Marshal, the North Koreans|used American POWs
{125194}{125235}during their brainwashing experiments.
{125236}{125323}They turned soldiers into traitors.|That's what they are doing here.
{125324}{125435}They're creating ghosts to go out in the world.|And do things sane men never do.
{125436}{125517}To have that kind of ability,|that kind of knowledge.
{125518}{125560}That would take years.
{125561}{125693}Years of research,|hundreds of patients to experiment on.
{125694}{125753}50 years from now,|people will look back
{125754}{125853}and say, "Here. This place|is where it all began."
{125854}{125887}The Nazis used the Jews.
{125888}{125988}The Soviets used prisoners|in their own gulags, and we...
{125989}{126041}We tested patients,
{126042}{126100}on Shutter Island.
{126101}{126199}No, they won't ...|No
{126256}{126345}You do understand
{126374}{126436}That they can't let you leave?
{126437}{126480}I am a federal marshal ...
{126481}{126548}They can't stop me.
{126549}{126628}I was an esteemed psychiatrist,
{126629}{126710}from a respected family.
{126711}{126800}It didn't matter.
{126815}{126856}Let me ask you ...
{126857}{126934}any past traumas in your life?
{126935}{127058}Yes. Why? Why would that matter?
{127059}{127106}Because they can point to some|event in your past and say
{127107}{127176}it is the reason you lost your sanity
{127177}{127238}So that when they commit you here
{127239}{127376}your friends and colleagues will say,|"Of course he cracked."
{127377}{127410}"And who wouldn't have,|after what he'd been through."
{127411}{127449}They can say that about anyone
{127450}{127612}- anyone at all.|- The point is they're going to say it about you.
{127613}{127688}How's your head?
{127689}{127768}- My head?|- Any funny dreams lately?
{127769}{127884}Trouble sleeping? Headaches?
{127906}{127949}I am prone to migraines. Yes.
{127950}{128012}Jesus!
{128040}{128098}You haven't taken any pills, have you?
{128099}{128157}- I mean even aspirin?|- They hit the aspirin?
{128158}{128201}Jesus!
{128202}{128290}And you ate the food in the cafeteria and drank|coffee they gave you.
{128291}{128408}You tell me at least that|you've been smoking your own cigarettes.
{128409}{128479}No... no.
{128514}{128551}No. I haven't.
{128552}{128617}It takes 36 to 48 hours for|neuroleptic narcotics
{128618}{128719}to reach workable levels in|the blood stream.
{128720}{128789}Palsy comes first
{128790}{128889}First the fingertips and then|eventually the whole hand.
{128890}{129051}Seen any walking nightmares|lately, marshal? Huh?
{129052}{129137}Tell me what goes on in that lighthouse?
{129138}{129194}Tell me.
{129195}{129259}Brain surgery.
{129260}{129366}"Let's open the skull and see|what happens if we pull on this" kind.
{129367}{129489}"We learned it from the Nazi's" kind.
{129490}{129572}It's where they create the ghosts.
{129573}{129634}Who knows about this?
{129635}{129736}On the island I mean. Who?
{129737}{129772}Everyone.
{129773}{129879}Oh come on. The nurses? The orderlies?
{129880}{130033}- They couldn't possibly know...|- Everyone.
{130395}{130459}You can't stay here.
{130460}{130567}They think I'm dead, that I drowned. I'm afraid|if they come looking for you, they might find me.
{130568}{130688}I'm sorry, but you have to go.
{130780}{130822}I'm gonna come back for you.
{130823}{130895}I won't be here. I move during the day.|new places every night.
{130896}{130952}But I could come get you|off of this island.
{130953}{131019}Haven't you heard a word I've said?
{131020}{131114}The only way off the island|is the ferry and they control it.
{131115}{131220}You'll never leave here.
{131395}{131439}I had a friend.
{131440}{131516}I was with him yesterday,|but we got separated.
{131517}{131586}Have you seen him?
{131587}{131659}Marshal...
{131660}{131756}You have no friends.
{132488}{132570}There you are.
{132587}{132691}We've been wondering when|you'd show up.
{132692}{132739}Have a seat.
{132740}{132807}Come on.
{133034}{133119}Taking a leisurely stroll? Were we?
{133120}{133173}I was just...
{133174}{133270}just looking around.
{133271}{133360}Did you enjoy|God's latest gift?
{133361}{133448}- What?|- God's gift.
{133449}{133528}The violence.
{133603}{133710}When I came downstairs in my home|and I saw that tree in my living room,
{133711}{133800}it reached down for me|like a divine hand.
{133801}{133895}God loves violence.
{133918}{133998}- I hadn't noticed.|- Sure you have.
{133999}{134060}Why else would there be so much of it?
{134061}{134100}It's in us.
{134101}{134173}It's what we are.
{134174}{134255}We wage war, we burn sacrifices,|we pillage and plunder
{134256}{134295}and tear at the flesh|of our brothers
{134296}{134470}and why? Because God gave us violence|to wage in his honor.
{134471}{134525}I thought God gave us moral order.
{134526}{134612}There is no moral order|as pure as this storm.
{134613}{134673}There's no moral order at all.
{134674}{134839}There's just this:|can my violence conquer yours?
{134896}{134980}- I'm not violent.|- Yes you are.
{134981}{135052}You're as violent as they come.
{135053}{135148}I know this because I'm|as violent as they come.
{135149}{135200}With the constraints of society,|we are lifted and
{135201}{135388}If I was all that stood between you and a meal, you|would crack my skull with a rock and eat my meaty parts.
{135389}{135468}Wouldn't you?
{135493}{135612}Cawley thinks you're harmless, that you can be|controlled, but I know different.
{135613}{135735}- You don't know me.|- Oh but I do. Oh I know you.
{135736}{135873}We've known each other for centuries.
{136026}{136091}If I was to sink my teeth into your eye|right now,
{136092}{136260}would you be able to stop|me before I blinded you?
{136271}{136345}Give it a try.
{136346}{136437}That's the spirit.
{137527}{137591}Where have you been?
{137592}{137646}Wandering, just looking at your island.
{137647}{137761}Oh I forgot. You're leaving.|Now that Rachel has been found.
{137762}{137836}Sure. Yeah.
{137852}{137896}Big meeting?
{137897}{137958}Oh, yes ...
{137959}{138022}Apparently there was an unidentified man|in ward C yesterday
{138023}{138136}He subdued a highly dangerous patient.|Quite handily.
{138137}{138164}Is that so?
{138165}{138349}It seems he had a long conversation with a|paranoid schizophrenic, George Noyce.
{138350}{138441}This Noyce,|you said his name was,
{138442}{138518}- he's delusional?|- Oh extremely. He can be quite upsetting.
{138519}{138594}In fact, two weeks ago, a patient|got so wound up
{138595}{138696}by one of Noyce's stories|that he beat him up.
{138697}{138768}Cigarette?
{138769}{138851}Oh. No, thanks.|I quit.
{138852}{138916}So, you're taking the ferry?
{138917}{138966}Oh yes. Absolutely. I uh...
{138967}{139031}I think we've gotten|all we came here for so.
{139032}{139111}"We" marshal?
{139114}{139166}Speaking of which. Have you
{139167}{139246}- seen him, Doctor?|- Who?
{139247}{139338}My partner, Chuck.
{139352}{139461}You don't have a partner, Marshal.|You came here alone.
{139462}{139524}You know, I've built|something valuable here.
{139525}{139611}And valuable things have a way of|being misunderstood in their own time.
{139612}{139661}Everyone wants a quick fix,|they always have.
{139662}{139749}I'm trying to do something that people,|yourself included, don't understand.
{139750}{139843}And I'm not going to give up|without a fight.
{139844}{139933}I can see that...
{139997}{140088}So tell me again|about your partner.
{140089}{140168}What partner?
{141695}{141767}Marshal...
{141768}{141814}Going somewhere?
{141815}{141942}No. Just heading out|to the ferry. So...
{141943}{142055}I'm afraid it's the other way.
{142056}{142114}If you wait a moment,
{142115}{142276}I'll find someone who can take you|to the dock.
{142278}{142339}What is this, doctor?
{142340}{142402}It's just a sedative.
{142403}{142525}- It's for precaution.|- Precaution?
{142526}{142640}What are you going to do?|Kill me? Marshal.
{142641}{142684}You think you deserve it?
{142685}{142765}For what?|For provoking you?
{142766}{142837}and, forgive me,|what doesn't provoke you?
{142838}{142875}Remarks...
{142876}{142930}- Words...|- Nazis!
{142931}{142980}Well that, too.
{142981}{143052}And of course, memories, dreams...
{143053}{143162}Did you know that the word "trauma" comes|from the Greek for "wound"?
{143163}{143265}And what is the German word for "dream"|"Traum".
{143266}{143325}Traum.
{143326}{143400}Wounds can create monsters.
{143401}{143487}And you ...|you are wounded, marshal.
{143488}{143577}Wouldn't you agree,|when you see a monster
{143578}{143667}you must stop it?
{143688}{143782}- I agree.|- Yes...
{144856}{144964}What are you doing, baby?
{145026}{145080}You've got to get to the ferry.
{145081}{145155}No. No.|No.
{145234}{145343}If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,|then he is perfect for their experiments.
{145344}{145468}There's only one place they'd take him.
{145469}{145530}You go there and you'll die.
{145531}{145635}He's my partner. If they are hurting him, if they are|holding him against his will, I've got to bring him out.
{145636}{145701}I can't lose anyone else.
{145702}{145865}Don't go, Teddy.|Please don't do this. Don't go.
{145874}{145963}I'm sorry, honey.
{145964}{146095}I love this thing because|you gave it to me
{146096}{146145}But the truth is ...
{146146}{146256}it's one fucking ugly tie.
{147189}{147244}No!
{149179}{149263}Don't move!|Stay where you are!
{149264}{149313}Are you going to kill me?
{149314}{149427}No.|I'm not gonna kill you.
{152103}{152199}Why are you all wet, baby?
{152200}{152370}- What did you say?|- You know exactly what I said.
{152583}{152700}The rifle's empty by the way.
{152778}{152855}Have a seat.
{152985}{153089}For god's sake dry off|you're going to catch a cold.
{153090}{153157}Alright.
{153180}{153307}How badly did you hurt the guard?
{153312}{153432}I don't know what|you're talking about.
{153433}{153484}Yes. He's here.
{153485}{153599}Have Dr.Sheehan take a good look|at your man before you send him up.
{153600}{153659}So, Dr. Shehan...
{153660}{153715}He came on the ferry|this morning, huh?
{153716}{153783}Not exactly.
{153784}{153878}You blew up my car.|I really loved that car.
{153879}{153987}Sorry to hear about that.
{154004}{154075}Tremors are getting pretty bad.
{154076}{154127}How are the hallucinations?
{154128}{154192}Get out of here, Teddy.
{154193}{154311}This place is gonna be the end of you.
{154312}{154390}- Not bad.|- They'll get worse.
{154391}{154438}I know.
{154439}{154496}Dr. Solando...
{154497}{154558}she told me about neuroleptics.
{154559}{154641}Did she now?|And when was this?
{154642}{154763}I found the doctor, in a cave out by the cliffs.|But you'll never get to her.
{154764}{154816}I don't doubt it.
{154817}{154898}Considering she's not real.
{154899}{154995}But your hallucinations are|more severe than I thought.
{154996}{155068}You are not on neuroleptics.
{155069}{155126}You are not on anything|as a matter of fact.
{155127}{155186}Then what the fuck is this?|Huh, what the fuck is this?
{155187}{155218}Withdrawal.
{155219}{155259}Withdrawal?
{155260}{155330}From what? I haven't even had a Goddamned|drink since I've been on this island.
{155331}{155371}Chlorpromazine.
{155372}{155484}I'm not a fan of pharmacology|but I have to say in your case ...
{155485}{155559}- Clorpro... what?|- Chlorpromazine.
{155560}{155704}The same thing we've been|giving you for the past 24 months.
{155705}{155740}So for the past two years
{155741}{155830}you've had somebody slipping|me drugs in Boston. Is that it?
{155831}{155912}Not Boston.|Here.
{155913}{156086}You've been here for two years.|A patient of this institution.
{156087}{156196}After everything I've seen here, doctor,
{156197}{156259}you really think you're gonna|convince me I'm crazy, huh?
{156260}{156377}Do you know the kind of people I deal with everyday?|I'm a U.S. marshal. For Gods sake.
{156378}{156470}You were a U.S. marshal.|Here's a copy of the intake form.
{156471}{156553}You broke into ward C for|proof of the 67th patient
{156554}{156638}If you'd gotten it to the mainland,|you could have blown the lid off this place.
{156639}{156672}- Wait... wait.|- But somehow
{156673}{156745}you couldn't find time|to look at it. Well read it now.
{156746}{156816}Go ahead.
{156868}{156922}The patient is highly intelligent,|highly delusional.
{156923}{156972}Decorated army veteran.
{156973}{157054}Present for the liberation of Dachau.
{157055}{157100}Former U.S. marshal.
{157101}{157128}Known proclivity for violence.
{157129}{157172}Shows no remorse for his crime|because he denies
{157173}{157256}that the crime ever took place.|Highly developed and fantastical
{157257}{157338}narratives which preclude facing|the truth of his actions.
{157339}{157367}I've had enough of this bullshit.
{157368}{157403}Where's my partner, huh?
{157404}{157462}Where's Chuck?|Where is he?
{157463}{157506}Let's try this another way.
{157507}{157571}Your wife's maiden name was|"Chanal". Am I correct?
{157572}{157676}- Don't you even talk about her!|- I'm afraid I have to.
{157677}{157761}Notice anything these four|names have in common?
{157762}{157801}Your rule of 4.
{157802}{157863}- Andrew, what do you see?|- If you have done anything
{157864}{157981}- to my partner, doctor. That is a violation ...|- Focus, Andrew. What do you see?
{157982}{158043}The names ...|have the same letters.
{158044}{158106}Edward Daniels has exactly the same|13 letters
{158107}{158169}as Andrew Laeddis.|The same as Rachel Solando
{158170}{158213}and Dolores Chanal.
{158214}{158261}- The names are anagrams for each other.
{158262}{158339}Your tactics, they're|not going to work on me.
{158340}{158401}You came here for the truth.|Here it is.
{158402}{158448}Your name is Andrew Laeddis.
{158449}{158579}The 67th patient at Ashecliffe|is you, Andrew.
{158580}{158599}Bullshit.
{158600}{158662}You were committed here by|court order 24 months ago.
{158663}{158743}Your crime is terrible.|One you can't forgive yourself for.
{158744}{158861}So you invented another self.
{158910}{158950}Let's get down to the facts.
{158951}{159046}You've created a story in which|you're not a murderer, you are hero.
{159047}{159082}Still a U.S marshal.
{159083}{159137}Only here at Ashecliffe|because of a case
{159138}{159180}and you've uncovered a conspiracy
{159181}{159255}so that anything we tell you about|who you are, what you've done
{159256}{159304}you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.
{159305}{159340}My name is Edward Daniels.
{159341}{159439}I've been hearing this fantasy|for two years now. I know every detail.
{159440}{159502}Patient 67. The storm.|Rachel Solando.
{159503}{159565}Your missing partner.|The dreams you have every night.
{159566}{159723}You were at Dachau,|But you may not have killed any guards.
{159724}{159808}I wish I could let you just|live in your fantasy world.
{159809}{159850}I really do.
{159851}{159975}But you're violent, trained, dangerous.|You're the most dangerous patient we have.
{159976}{160038}You've injured orderlies. Guards.|Other patients.
{160039}{160101}Two weeks ago|you attacked George Noyce.
{160102}{160143}No, no! I am fucking on to you doctor!
{160144}{160193}- You had Noyce beaten.|- Of course I didn't.
{160194}{160246}Give me one reason|why I would even touch him.
{160247}{160293}Because he called you Laeddis
{160294}{160381}and you do anything not to be him.
{160382}{160444}I have a transcript of that conversation|you had with Noyce yesterday.
{160445}{160601}This is about you and Laeddis.|That's all it's ever been about
{160602}{160664}No. No. He is saying that it's about|"me and Laeddis".
{160665}{160727}When you've asked him what happened|to his face,
{160728}{160797}said, and I quote again,|"You did this".
{160798}{160941}- No. He meant it was my fault he...|- You almost killed him.
{160942}{161054}The warden and the board of overseers|are determined something be done. It's been decided.
{161055}{161167}That unless, we can bring you back|to sanity now, right now,
{161168}{161332}permanent measures will be taken to ensure|you can't hurt anyone ever again.
{161333}{161389}They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
{161390}{161481}Do you understand?
{161522}{161574}Yeah, I understand.
{161575}{161651}I understand just fine.
{161652}{161749}If... if I don't play along|with your little game here.
{161750}{161815}Dr. Naehring is gonna turn me into|one of his ghosts.
{161816}{161870}What about my partner?
{161871}{162023}You're gonna tell the U.S. marshal's office|that he's a defense mechanism?
{162024}{162101}Hello, boss.
{162490}{162612}What the fuck is going on here?
{162648}{162697}You working for him?
{162698}{162873}I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.|Someone had to stick with you. Keep you safe.
{162874}{162936}You've been watching me, huh?
{162937}{163026}Watching me every minute.
{163027}{163069}Who... who are you?
{163070}{163114}Who are you?|Tell me.
{163115}{163201}Don't you recognize me, Andrew?
{163202}{163296}I've been you primary psychiatrist|for the last two years.
{163297}{163393}I am Lester Sheehan.
{163482}{163546}And I told you about my wife ...
{163547}{163630}- I know.|- I climbed down a cliff to get you.
{163631}{163739}I trusted you. I risked everything|to come in here after you. Everything!
{163740}{163766}I know, boss.
{163767}{163841}We're running out of time here, Andrew,
{163842}{163904}I swore before the board of|overseers that I could construct
{163905}{163967}the most radical, cutting edge role-play
{163968}{164030}ever attempted in psychiatry and|it would bring you back.
{164031}{164110}I thought if we let you play this out
{164111}{164217}we could get you to see how|untrue, how impossible it is.
{164218}{164274}You've had to run of|the place for two days.
{164275}{164365}Tell me, where are the Nazi experiments?
{164366}{164460}The satanic O.R.'s?
{164726}{164824}Andrew, listen to me.
{164825}{164892}If we fail with you
{164893}{164950}then everything we've tried|to do here will be discredited.
{164951}{165025}Everything.
{165037}{165128}We are on the front line|of a war here, old boy.
{165129}{165268}And right now, it'll come down to you.
{165354}{165405}Don't move! Don't move!
{165406}{165503}- Andrew, no!|- My name is Edward Daniels.
{165504}{165573}This one is loaded.|I can tell by the weight.
{165574}{165635}I see. And that's your firearm marshal?|You're sure?
{165636}{165675}My initials are on the side and there's a dent in the|barrel from when Philip Stacks shot at me.
{165676}{165779}You're not going to fuck with my mind on this|one Doc
{165780}{166018}Then blast away, because that's the|only way you're ever getting off this island.
{166019}{166117}Andrew, please don't.
{166322}{166392}My gun...
{166520}{166584}What have you done to|my Goddamn gun.
{166585}{166679}It's a toy, Andrew.
{166689}{166763}We're telling you the truth.
{166764}{166856}Dolores was insane. Manic-depressive.|Suicidal.
{166857}{166934}You drank. Stayed away.|Ignored what everyone had told you.
{166935}{167009}You moved to that lake house after|she, purposely,
{167010}{167076}set your city apartment on fire
{167077}{167172}Andrew! Andrew!|Stop it!
{167173}{167209}You're lying...
{167210}{167273}Andrew, your children.
{167274}{167325}Simon...
{167326}{167394}- Henry...|- I didn't have any children.
{167395}{167439}Your wife drowned them.
{167440}{167504}At the cabin by the lake.
{167505}{167573}And here, the little girl,|the one you dream of
{167574}{167617}every night.
{167618}{167648}I never had a little girl.
{167649}{167747}The one who tells you over and over that|you should have saved her
{167748}{167789}Saved them all.
{167790}{167830}Your daughter...
{167831}{167933}Her name was Rachel. Are you going to deny|that she ever lived?
{167934}{168020}Andrew, are you?
{168520}{168618}I'm so sorry, baby...
{168665}{168725}I told you not to come in here.
{168726}{168779}I told you...
{168780}{168897}this would be the end of you.
{169329}{169381}I'm back.
{169382}{169482}We got him just outside of Oklahoma.|Must of stopped ten places
{169483}{169651}in between here and Tulsa.|I could sleep for a week.
{169652}{169719}Dolores?
{169841}{169908}Dolores?
{170053}{170120}Dolores?
{170424}{170491}Dolores?
{171052}{171117}Baby...
{171135}{171231}Why are you all wet?
{171240}{171319}I missed you.
{171440}{171531}I want to go home.
{171576}{171655}You are home!
{171737}{171831}Where are the kids?
{171866}{171957}They're in school.
{172015}{172076}It's Saturday, honey.
{172077}{172192}School's not in on Saturday.
{172200}{172279}My school is.
{172557}{172629}Oh my God!
{172666}{172731}My God!
{173047}{173105}God!
{173160}{173242}Oh my God, no!
{173311}{173400}Come on!|Come on!
{173788}{173849}Please, God, no.
{173850}{173905}No!
{173958}{174013}No!
{174124}{174179}No!
{174214}{174269}No!
{175769}{175846}Let's put them at the table, Andrew.
{175847}{175917}We'll dry them off...
{175918}{176001}We'll change their clothes...
{176002}{176117}They'll be our living dolls.
{176155}{176294}Tomorrow we can take them on a picnic.
{176358}{176407}If you ever loved me, Dolores...
{176408}{176504}Please stop talking.
{176587}{176661}I love you.
{176858}{176935}Set me free!
{177033}{177096}Baby...
{177097}{177202}We'll give them baths...
{177341}{177533}- I love you so much, Dolores.|- And I love you. I love you.
{178142}{178212}Andrew...
{178235}{178319}Andrew, can you hear me?
{178320}{178428}Rachel!|Rachel, Rachel...
{178446}{178511}Rachel.
{178530}{178604}Rachel who?
{178659}{178723}Rachel Laeddis...
{178724}{178801}My daughter.
{178846}{178935}Why are you here?
{178968}{179014}Because I killed my wife.
{179015}{179120}and why did you do that?
{179166}{179265}Because she murdered our children.
{179266}{179386}And she told me to let her go.
{179406}{179536}- Who is Teddy Daniels?|- He doesn't exist.
{179537}{179599}Neither does Rachel Solando.|I made them up.
{179600}{179658}Why?
{179662}{179775}We need to hear you say it.
{179863}{179972}After she tried to kill|herself the first time,
{179973}{180042}Dolores told me she...
{180043}{180123}she had an insect...
{180124}{180196}living inside her brain.
{180197}{180283}She could feel it...
{180284}{180376}clicking across|her skull...
{180377}{180501}pulling the wires,|just for fun.
{180502}{180576}She told me that.
{180577}{180716}She told me that, but I didn't listen.
{180759}{180834}I loved her so much.
{180835}{180925}Why did you make them up?
{180926}{181123}Because I can't take knowing|that Dolores killed our children.
{181205}{181361}I killed them, because|I didn't get her help.
{181411}{181497}I killed them...
{181575}{181675}Here's my theory, Andrew.|We broke through once before,
{181676}{181788}nine months ago,|and then you regressed.
{181789}{181895}- I don't remember that.|- I know.
{181896}{181975}You reset, Andrew.|Like a tape playing
{181976}{182083}over and over on an endless loop.
{182084}{182157}I hope that what we've done will be enough|to stop it from ever happening again
{182158}{182220}But I need to know ...
{182221}{182331}you have accepted reality.
{182437}{182559}You came after me, huh, doctor?
{182583}{182736}You tried to help me|when no one else would.
{182940}{183055}My name is Andrew Laeddis...
{183152}{183305}And I murdered my wife|in the spring of '52.
{183849}{183906}How we doing this morning?
{183907}{183948}Good.|And You?
{183949}{184033}Can't complain.
{184212}{184270}So what's our next move?
{184271}{184348}You tell me.
{184441}{184540}I've gotta get off this rock,|Chuck.
{184541}{184759}Get back to the mainland. Whatever the|hell is going on here. It's bad.
{185138}{185303}Don't worry, partner.|They're not gonna catch us.
{185360}{185449}That's right. We're too smart for them.
{185450}{185555}Yeah, we are.|Aren't we?
{185881}{185959}You know this place makes|me wonder.
{185960}{186030}Yeah? What's that boss?
{186031}{186095}Which would be worse?
{186096}{186159}To live as a monster ...
{186160}{186265}or to die as a good man.
{186430}{186492}Teddy?
