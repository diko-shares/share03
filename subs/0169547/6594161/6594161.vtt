1
00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:35.126
I need a father who's a role model.

2
00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:37.586
Not some horny geek-boy
who's gonna spray his shorts ...

3
00:00:37.754 --> 00:00:40.172
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

4
00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:44.385
What a lame-o.

5
00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.850
Someone really should just
put him out of his misery.

6
00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:55.604
Want me to kill him for you?

7
00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:05.948
Yeah. Would you?

8
00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:21.338
My name is Lester Burnham.

9
00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:24.550
This is my neighborhood.

10
00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:27.720
This is my street.

11
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.182
This is my life.

12
00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:34.977
I'm 42 years old.
In less than a year ...

13
00:01:35.604 --> 00:01:36.771
I'll be dead.

14
00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:46.739
Of course, I don't know that yet.

15
00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:53.704
And in a way, I'm dead already.

16
00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.050
Look at me.

17
00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:07.885
Jerking off in the shower.

18
00:02:09.638 --> 00:02:12.389
This will be the 
high point of my day.

19
00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:14.892
It's all downhill from here.

20
00:02:19.898 --> 00:02:21.607
That's my wife, Carolyn.

21
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.571
See the way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs?

22
00:02:28.406 --> 00:02:29.907
That's not an accident.

23
00:02:30.826 --> 00:02:33.244
Hush, Bitsy!

24
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:35.079
Hush! What is wrong with you?

25
00:02:35.247 --> 00:02:37.248
That's our next door neighbor, Jim.

26
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.085
And that's his lover ... Jim.

27
00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:42.711
You spoil her. Bitsy ...

28
00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.339
- Me?
no bark! Come inside now!

29
00:02:45.507 --> 00:02:47.842
- Come on.
- Good morning, Jim!

30
00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.094
Morning, Carolyn.

31
00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:54.306
I love your tie. That color!

32
00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.141
I just love your roses.

33
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.894
How do you get them
to flourish like this?

34
00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:02.690
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

35
00:03:02.858 --> 00:03:04.733
- I've never heard of that.
- Man ...

36
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.444
I get exhausted just watching her.

37
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.490
She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.

38
00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:15.744
We used to be happy.

39
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.584
My daughter, Jane. Only child.

40
00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:27.298
Janie's a pretty typical teenager:

41
00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:30.759
angry, insecure, confused.

42
00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:34.805
I wish I could tell her
that's all going to pass ...

43
00:03:34.973 --> 00:03:36.807
but I don't want to lie to her.

44
00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:44.064
Jane, honey, are you 
trying to look unattractive?

45
00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:45.482
Yes.

46
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.277
Congratulations,
you've succeeded admirably.

47
00:03:48.445 --> 00:03:52.865
Lester, could you make me a little
later? I'm not quite late enough.

48
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.495
Nice going, Dad.

49
00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:02.833
Both my wife and daughter
think I'm this gigantic loser.

50
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:04.835
And they're right.

51
00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:09.465
I have lost something.

52
00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:11.842
I'm not exactly sure what it is,

53
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.514
but I know I didn't always
feel this ... sedated.

54
00:04:19.017 --> 00:04:20.935
But you know what?

55
00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:24.355
It's never too late to get it back.

56
00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:29.026
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from Media Monthly magazine.

57
00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:31.028
I'm calling for 
Mr. Tamblin, please.

58
00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:34.323
Well, we're all 
under a deadline here.

59
00:04:34.491 --> 00:04:36.700
There's some information
about your product launch ...

60
00:04:36.868 --> 00:04:38.994
that isn't even covered
in your press release and ...

61
00:04:40.872 --> 00:04:43.123
Yeah, OK. Can I ask you a question?

62
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:45.459
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?

63
00:04:45.627 --> 00:04:47.461
'Cause he doesn't
ever seem to come in.

64
00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:50.631
Yeah, OK. I'll leave my number.

65
00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:55.135
It's 555-0199.

66
00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:58.389
Lester Burnham. Thank you.

67
00:05:00.308 --> 00:05:01.517
Hey, Les.

68
00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:04.311
You got a minute?

69
00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.147
For you, Brad, I got five.

70
00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:10.693
So I'm sure you can understand ...

71
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.653
our need to cut corners around here.

72
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:16.699
Sure. Times are tight.
You got to free up some cash.

73
00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:19.243
You got to spend money
to make money, right?

74
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:23.080
- Exactly.
- Like the time when Mr. Flournoy ...

75
00:05:23.248 --> 00:05:26.083
used the company MasterCard
to pay for that hooker,

76
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:29.503
then she used the card and stayed
at the St. Regis for three months ...

77
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:32.756
- That's unsubstantiated gossip!
- That's $50,000!

78
00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:34.758
That's someone's salary
who's gonna get fired ...

79
00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:36.927
because Craig has to
pay women to fuck him!

80
00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:40.681
Jesus! Calm down.

81
00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:42.599
Nobody's getting fired yet.

82
00:05:42.767 --> 00:05:46.770
That's why we're having everyone
write out a job description ...

83
00:05:46.938 --> 00:05:49.732
mapping out in detail
how they contribute.

84
00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.985
That way management can
assess who's valuable ...

85
00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:55.070
And who's expendable.

86
00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.323
It's just business.

87
00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:04.288
I've been writing for this magazine
for 14 years. You've been here a month?

88
00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:06.540
I'm one of the good guys, Les.

89
00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:09.460
I'm trying to level with you.

90
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.047
This is your one chance
to save your job.

91
00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:17.509
There's no decision.
Just write the damn thing.

92
00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:20.345
You don't think it's weird
and kind of fascist?

93
00:06:20.513 --> 00:06:22.681
Possibly, but you don't want
to be unemployed.

94
00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.768
Let's sell our souls and work for 
Satan because it's more convenient.

95
00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:28.812
Could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please?

96
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.648
So we finally got new neighbors.

97
00:06:31.816 --> 00:06:35.819
If the Lomans had let me represent 
them instead of the Real Estate King ...

98
00:06:35.987 --> 00:06:38.322
that house would never have sat
on the market for six months.

99
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.283
They were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

100
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.869
Their sycamore? Come on!

101
00:06:44.037 --> 00:06:47.623
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

102
00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:49.583
How can you call it their sycamore?

103
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:54.338
I wouldn't have the heart to cut down
something if it wasn't partially mine.

104
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.727
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?

105
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.689
No. No, we don't.

106
00:07:12.857 --> 00:07:16.777
As soon as you've prepared a nutritious,
yet savory, meal that I'm about to eat ...

107
00:07:16.945 --> 00:07:19.071
you can listen to whatever you like.

108
00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:25.994
So, Janie, how was school?

109
00:07:27.288 --> 00:07:29.123
It was OK.

110
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.749
Just OK?

111
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:35.337
No, Dad. It was spectacular.

112
00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:41.718
Well, you want to know how 
things went at my job today?

113
00:07:41.886 --> 00:07:44.304
They've hired this 
efficiency expert.

114
00:07:44.472 --> 00:07:48.392
This really friendly guy named Brad.
How perfect is that?

115
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.896
He's there to make it seem like
they're justified in firing somebody ...

116
00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:55.607
because they couldn't just
come right out and say that.

117
00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.609
That would just be too honest.

118
00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:01.363
So they've asked us. You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?

119
00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:04.241
Well, what do you expect?

120
00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.911
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

121
00:08:10.415 --> 00:08:14.293
I mean, hello! You've barely
even spoken to me for months.

122
00:08:20.842 --> 00:08:25.429
What? You're Mother of the Year?
You treat her like an employee.

123
00:08:25.597 --> 00:08:27.181
What?

124
00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:30.767
What?!

125
00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:35.272
I'm going to get some ice cream.

126
00:08:43.698 --> 00:08:44.948
Janie ...

127
00:08:46.326 --> 00:08:49.453
I'm sorry I haven't been more ...

128
00:08:50.455 --> 00:08:52.789
available. I'm just ... I ...

129
00:08:56.044 --> 00:08:59.129
You know, you don't always have 
to wait for me to come to you.

130
00:09:00.798 --> 00:09:02.966
Great. So now it's my fault?

131
00:09:03.134 --> 00:09:05.719
I didn't say that. 
It's nobody's fault.

132
00:09:07.805 --> 00:09:11.058
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.

133
00:10:50.908 --> 00:11:25.942
I will sell this house today.

134
00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:37.079
Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham.

135
00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:40.374
This living room is very dramatic.

136
00:11:40.541 --> 00:11:43.210
Wait till you see
the native stone fireplace!

137
00:11:43.378 --> 00:11:46.505
A simple cream
could really lighten things up.

138
00:11:46.672 --> 00:11:48.673
You could even put in a skylight.

139
00:11:51.594 --> 00:11:53.637
Well, why don't we 
go into the kitchen?

140
00:11:53.805 --> 00:11:57.099
It's a dream come true for any cook.

141
00:11:57.266 --> 00:11:59.810
Just filled with positive energy.

142
00:12:00.728 --> 00:12:05.732
You'll be surprised how much a ceiling
fan can cut down on your energy costs.

143
00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:13.824
You know, you could have some really
fun backyard get-togethers out here.

144
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:15.867
The ad said this pool
was "lagoon-like."

145
00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:19.788
- Nothing "lagoon-like" about it.
- Except for maybe the bugs!

146
00:12:19.956 --> 00:12:21.748
There aren't even 
any plants out here!

147
00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:24.751
What do you call this?
Is this not this a plant?

148
00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:28.797
If you have a problem with the plants,
I can call my landscape architect.

149
00:12:28.965 --> 00:12:31.716
- Solved!
- I think lagoon, I think waterfall.

150
00:12:31.884 --> 00:12:36.012
I think tropical.
This is a cement hole.

151
00:12:39.142 --> 00:12:41.309
I have some tiki torches 
in the garage.

152
00:13:13.593 --> 00:13:14.926
Shut up!

153
00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:18.221
Stop it! You weak. 
You baby! Shut up!

154
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:20.223
Shut up! Shut up!

155
00:14:06.103 --> 00:14:07.938
Who are you looking for?

156
00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:10.482
My parents are coming tonight.

157
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.985
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

158
00:14:14.153 --> 00:14:16.613
Gross. I hate it 
when my mom does that.

159
00:14:17.448 --> 00:14:21.117
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives?

160
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.458
What makes you so sure she wants us
to be there? Did she ask?

161
00:14:28.626 --> 00:14:32.128
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.

162
00:14:32.296 --> 00:14:34.130
But she's been practicing
her steps for weeks.

163
00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:36.174
I'll bet money she'll resent it.

164
00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:38.552
And I'm missing
the James Bond marathon on TNT.

165
00:14:38.719 --> 00:14:40.804
Lester! This is important!

166
00:14:40.972 --> 00:14:43.640
I'm sensing a real distance
growing between you and Jane.

167
00:14:43.808 --> 00:14:46.560
Growing? She hates me.

168
00:14:46.727 --> 00:14:48.311
She's just willful.

169
00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:50.188
She hates you, too.

170
00:14:59.448 --> 00:15:01.241
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

171
00:15:01.409 --> 00:15:04.202
Pardon me. Excuse me.

172
00:15:05.037 --> 00:15:07.330
Now, for your 
halftime entertainment,

173
00:15:07.498 --> 00:15:11.626
Rockwell High's award-winning
Dancing Spartanettes!

174
00:15:11.794 --> 00:15:13.962
We can leave right 
after this, right?

175
00:17:28.597 --> 00:17:30.473
Shit! They're still here.

176
00:17:31.392 --> 00:17:34.978
- Janie!
- Hey, I really enjoyed that!

177
00:17:35.146 --> 00:17:37.981
- Congratulations! You were great!
- I didn't win anything.

178
00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:40.066
Hi, I'm Lester, Janie's dad.

179
00:17:40.234 --> 00:17:41.776
Oh, hi.

180
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.990
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

181
00:17:47.158 --> 00:17:50.452
OK. Good to meet you.

182
00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:53.163
You were also good tonight. Very ...

183
00:17:57.293 --> 00:18:00.128
Nice to meet you, Angela. Honey!

184
00:18:00.296 --> 00:18:03.256
I am so proud of you! You know,
I watched you very closely.

185
00:18:03.424 --> 00:18:05.216
You didn't screw up once!

186
00:18:06.677 --> 00:18:09.012
OK. We have to go.

187
00:18:10.055 --> 00:18:12.432
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad!

188
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.434
We're going out for pizza.

189
00:18:14.602 --> 00:18:17.103
Really? We can give you a ride.
I have a car. Want to come with us?

190
00:18:17.271 --> 00:18:19.522
Thanks, but I have a car.

191
00:18:20.608 --> 00:18:22.984
You have a car. Well, that's great.
That's great.

192
00:18:23.152 --> 00:18:26.362
'Cause Janie's thinking about
getting a car soon, aren't you?

193
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.698
Dad! Mom's waiting for you.

194
00:18:32.369 --> 00:18:34.412
It was very nice 
meeting you, Angela.

195
00:18:35.706 --> 00:18:37.749
Any friend of Janie's is ...

196
00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:40.543
a friend of mine.

197
00:18:44.715 --> 00:18:46.049
Well ...

198
00:18:47.343 --> 00:18:48.760
I'll be seeing you around, then.

199
00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:57.143
Could he be any more ... pathetic?

200
00:18:57.311 --> 00:18:59.187
I think he's sweet.

201
00:19:00.773 --> 00:19:04.567
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

202
00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.170
It's the weirdest thing.

203
00:19:25.089 --> 00:19:28.591
I feel like I've been
in a coma for about 20 years ...

204
00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:31.094
and I'm just now waking up.

205
00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:05.503
Spectacular.

206
00:20:14.388 --> 00:20:17.807
I'm so sorry my dad 
was weird tonight.

207
00:20:19.768 --> 00:20:21.603
That's OK.

208
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.646
I'm used to guys drooling over me.

209
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:27.650
It started when I was about 12.

210
00:20:28.944 --> 00:20:30.904
I'd go to dinner with my parents.

211
00:20:31.071 --> 00:20:33.489
Every Thursday night, Red Lobster.

212
00:20:34.491 --> 00:20:37.076
And every guy there would 
stare at me when I walked in.

213
00:20:37.244 --> 00:20:39.162
And I knew what they were thinking.

214
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.206
Just like I knew guys at school
thought about me when they jerked off.

215
00:20:43.334 --> 00:20:46.169
- Vomit.
- No, I liked it.

216
00:20:46.337 --> 00:20:48.296
And I still like it.

217
00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:51.007
If people I don't even know
look at me and want to fuck me ...

218
00:20:51.175 --> 00:20:56.888
it means I really have a shot
at being a model, which is great.

219
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:01.643
Because there's nothing worse 
in life than being ordinary.

220
00:21:05.856 --> 00:21:07.774
I really think 
it'll happen for you.

221
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.402
I know.

222
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.697
Because everything
that was meant to happen, does ...

223
00:21:14.865 --> 00:21:16.407
eventually.

224
00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:43.309
Asshole.

225
00:22:48.459 --> 00:22:52.003
Hello?

226
00:23:08.145 --> 00:23:10.563
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?

227
00:23:10.731 --> 00:23:12.315
I didn't.

228
00:23:12.483 --> 00:23:15.026
My phone rang and I answered,
and somebody hung up.

229
00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:16.986
I star-69'd, and I called you back.

230
00:23:17.154 --> 00:23:19.072
Well, I was in the shower.

231
00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:25.787
Oh, gross!

232
00:23:41.637 --> 00:23:43.971
Ricky? Breakfast!

233
00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.059
Be right there.

234
00:23:57.194 --> 00:23:58.319
- Mom?
- Hello.

235
00:23:58.487 --> 00:24:00.822
I don't eat bacon, remember?

236
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:04.408
I'm sorry. I must've forgotten.

237
00:24:16.046 --> 00:24:17.755
What's new in the world, Dad?

238
00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:22.218
This country is going 
straight to hell.

239
00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:32.562
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

240
00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:37.733
No.

241
00:24:44.992 --> 00:24:47.118
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

242
00:24:47.286 --> 00:24:48.744
Just something from our garden.

243
00:24:48.912 --> 00:24:51.080
Except the pasta.
We got that at Fallaci's.

244
00:24:51.248 --> 00:24:54.250
It's unbelievably fresh.
Drop it in the water and it's done.

245
00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.589
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

246
00:24:59.756 --> 00:25:02.091
Colonel Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps.

247
00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:05.761
- Nice to meet you. This is my partner.
- Jim Berkley, but people call me J.B.

248
00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:09.223
Let's cut to the chase, OK?
What are you guys selling?

249
00:25:10.934 --> 00:25:13.352
Nothing. We just wanted to say hi
to our new neighbors.

250
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.605
Yeah, yeah ...

251
00:25:15.772 --> 00:25:18.941
You said you're partners,
so what's your business?

252
00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:21.777
Well ...

253
00:25:22.696 --> 00:25:24.614
He is a tax attorney.

254
00:25:24.781 --> 00:25:26.616
And he's an anesthesiologist.

255
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.296
How come these faggots always 
have to rub it in your face?

256
00:25:41.965 --> 00:25:43.966
How can they be so shameless?

257
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.638
That's the whole thing, Dad.

258
00:25:48.805 --> 00:25:51.265
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

259
00:25:53.143 --> 00:25:54.894
Well, it is.

260
00:25:57.356 --> 00:25:58.814
Yeah, you're right.

261
00:25:58.982 --> 00:26:01.692
Don't placate me
like I'm your mother, boy.

262
00:26:05.197 --> 00:26:07.573
Forgive me, sir,
for speaking so bluntly:

263
00:26:07.741 --> 00:26:10.493
Those fags make me want to puke
my fucking guts out.

264
00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.169
Well, me too, Son.

265
00:26:21.505 --> 00:26:22.964
Yeah, me too.

266
00:26:29.137 --> 00:26:32.598
I'm serious. He just pulled down
his pants and yanked it out.

267
00:26:32.766 --> 00:26:35.184
You know, like,
"Say hello to Mr. Happy."

268
00:26:35.352 --> 00:26:38.229
- Gross.
- It wasn't gross.

269
00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:41.190
- It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?

270
00:26:41.358 --> 00:26:42.775
Of course I did.

271
00:26:42.943 --> 00:26:45.611
He is a really 
well-known photographer.

272
00:26:45.779 --> 00:26:48.531
He shoots for Elle
on, like, a regular basis.

273
00:26:48.699 --> 00:26:51.158
It would've been so majorly
stupid of me to turn him down.

274
00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:53.494
You are a total prostitute.

275
00:26:54.371 --> 00:26:57.540
Hey. That's how things really are.

276
00:26:57.708 --> 00:27:01.419
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.

277
00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:05.172
So are you. You've only been in
Seventeen once, and you looked fat!

278
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.010
So stop acting like you're
goddamned Christy Turlington!

279
00:27:11.513 --> 00:27:12.847
Cunt!

280
00:27:14.725 --> 00:27:18.185
I am so sick of people taking 
their insecurities out on me.

281
00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:23.607
Oh, my God! That's the pervert
who filmed me last night.

282
00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:27.236
Him? Jane, no way,
he's a total lunatic.

283
00:27:27.404 --> 00:27:29.238
- You know him?
- Yeah.

284
00:27:29.406 --> 00:27:31.741
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade ...

285
00:27:31.908 --> 00:27:35.077
and he would always say
the most random, weird things.

286
00:27:35.245 --> 00:27:38.914
And then one day,
he was just, like, gone.

287
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.418
And then, Connie Cardullo told me ...

288
00:27:42.586 --> 00:27:45.546
that his parents had to put 
him in a mental institution.

289
00:27:45.714 --> 00:27:47.798
Why? What did he do?

290
00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:49.759
What do you mean?

291
00:27:50.677 --> 00:27:54.930
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

292
00:27:57.392 --> 00:28:00.478
You total slut!

293
00:28:01.355 --> 00:28:03.773
- You've got a crush on him!
- What? Please!

294
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.526
You're defending him. You love him.
You want to have 10,000 of his babies.

295
00:28:07.694 --> 00:28:09.945
- Shut up!
- Hi.

296
00:28:10.113 --> 00:28:13.115
My name's Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.

297
00:28:13.283 --> 00:28:15.242
I know.

298
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.413
I remember this really creepy incident
where you were filming me last night.

299
00:28:19.581 --> 00:28:22.958
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just think you're interesting.

300
00:28:23.126 --> 00:28:28.297
Thanks, but I don't need some psycho
obsessing about me right now.

301
00:28:29.424 --> 00:28:32.510
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just curious.

302
00:28:48.568 --> 00:28:50.486
What a freak!

303
00:28:50.654 --> 00:28:52.655
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?

304
00:28:54.241 --> 00:28:57.076
He's, like, so confident.

305
00:28:57.244 --> 00:28:59.662
That can't be real.

306
00:29:01.164 --> 00:29:02.915
I don't believe him.

307
00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:06.293
I mean, he didn't 
even look at me once.

308
00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:13.551
How'd you get in the Army?

309
00:29:13.718 --> 00:29:16.178
Look, Sergeant, I got three 
reasons for being in the Army.

310
00:29:16.346 --> 00:29:20.349
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. And third, they nailed me.

311
00:29:23.019 --> 00:29:25.729
You two boys report to me
immediately after this formation.

312
00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:27.314
Take them away, Sarge!

313
00:29:34.781 --> 00:29:36.907
Hey.

314
00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:39.660
One, two, three, four.

315
00:29:39.828 --> 00:29:41.704
What's going on here?

316
00:29:41.872 --> 00:29:44.373
Bend all the way down.
Here comes the bull of the woods.

317
00:29:46.293 --> 00:29:48.085
I'm sorry, what?

318
00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:52.173
Mom, nobody said anything.

319
00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.884
Oh. I'm sorry.

320
00:30:01.808 --> 00:30:05.227
Everyone's with their spouse. How'd
it look if I showed up with no one?

321
00:30:05.395 --> 00:30:08.355
- You end up ignoring me and talking ...
- Now listen to me.

322
00:30:08.523 --> 00:30:10.149
This is an important 
business function.

323
00:30:10.317 --> 00:30:13.402
As you know,
my business is selling an image ...

324
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.113
and part of my job
is to live that image ...

325
00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:17.740
Honey, do me a favor.

326
00:30:17.908 --> 00:30:20.534
Just say whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.

327
00:30:20.702 --> 00:30:23.204
All right. Hi, Shirley!

328
00:30:25.081 --> 00:30:27.833
Listen, just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

329
00:30:28.001 --> 00:30:30.753
- I am happy, honey.
- No, you're not.

330
00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:32.713
Oh! That's Buddy!

331
00:30:32.881 --> 00:30:35.257
Buddy. Buddy!

332
00:30:35.425 --> 00:30:38.928
- Hi.
- Hi! Good to see you again.

333
00:30:39.095 --> 00:30:41.847
It's so good to see you, 
too, Catherine.

334
00:30:42.015 --> 00:30:45.434
- Carolyn.
- Carolyn, of course. How are you?

335
00:30:45.602 --> 00:30:47.394
Very well, thank you.

336
00:30:47.562 --> 00:30:49.480
- Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

337
00:30:51.024 --> 00:30:53.609
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

338
00:30:53.777 --> 00:30:56.445
We've met before, actually.
This thing last year.

339
00:30:56.613 --> 00:31:00.241
- Christmas at the Sheraton.
- Oh, yeah.

340
00:31:01.284 --> 00:31:03.702
It's OK. I wouldn't 
remember me, either.

341
00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.251
Honey, don't be weird!

342
00:31:11.211 --> 00:31:13.754
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- OK.

343
00:31:13.922 --> 00:31:18.217
- I'll be whatever you want me to be.
- Well, OK ...

344
00:31:29.604 --> 00:31:32.856
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.

345
00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:39.488
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

346
00:31:46.496 --> 00:31:48.455
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

347
00:32:04.514 --> 00:32:05.514
Excuse me.

348
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.727
Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail?
The house with the red door?

349
00:32:10.353 --> 00:32:11.353
Yeah.

350
00:32:11.521 --> 00:32:14.732
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
in the house next to you.

351
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.028
Hi, Ricky Fitts. 
I'm Lester Burnham.

352
00:32:19.195 --> 00:32:21.697
Hi, Mr. Burnham.

353
00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:32.916
Do you party?

354
00:32:34.461 --> 00:32:37.379
- Excuse me?
- Do you get high?

355
00:32:41.134 --> 00:32:44.386
I probably wouldn't even tell you 
this if I weren't a little tipsy ...

356
00:32:44.554 --> 00:32:49.224
but ... I'm in complete awe of you.

357
00:32:50.518 --> 00:32:56.398
I mean, your firm is hands down the
Rolls Royce of local real estate firms ...

358
00:32:56.566 --> 00:32:59.735
and your personal sales record is ...

359
00:33:02.155 --> 00:33:04.198
It's very intimidating.

360
00:33:05.075 --> 00:33:09.495
You know, I'd love to sit down 
with you and just pick your brain.

361
00:33:09.663 --> 00:33:11.705
If you'd ever be willing.

362
00:33:14.167 --> 00:33:17.544
You know? I suppose, technically,
I'm the competition ...

363
00:33:17.712 --> 00:33:21.423
but, I mean, 
I don't flatter myself ...

364
00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:24.385
that I'm even in the 
same league as you.

365
00:33:24.552 --> 00:33:26.261
I don't.

366
00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:28.722
I'd love to.

367
00:33:30.934 --> 00:33:33.727
- Really?
- Absolutely.

368
00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:36.855
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

369
00:33:38.858 --> 00:33:40.859
I'll do that. Thank you.

370
00:33:47.784 --> 00:33:52.371
Did you see that movie where the body
is walking around carrying its own head ...

371
00:33:52.539 --> 00:33:55.207
and then the head
goes down on that babe?

372
00:33:55.375 --> 00:33:57.668
Re-Animator.

373
00:34:00.839 --> 00:34:05.134
Look, I'm not paying you to do
whatever it is you're doing out here.

374
00:34:06.136 --> 00:34:08.137
Fine. So don't pay me.

375
00:34:09.556 --> 00:34:11.932
- Excuse me?
- I quit.

376
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.352
So you don't have to pay me.
Now leave me alone.

377
00:34:17.897 --> 00:34:19.231
Asshole.

378
00:34:24.529 --> 00:34:26.697
I think you just became
my personal hero.

379
00:34:27.824 --> 00:34:31.076
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?

380
00:34:32.996 --> 00:34:35.664
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 16 ...

381
00:34:35.832 --> 00:34:37.541
Eighteen.

382
00:34:38.501 --> 00:34:40.669
I just do these gigs as a cover.

383
00:34:40.837 --> 00:34:43.464
I have other sources of income.

384
00:34:44.716 --> 00:34:46.216
But my dad interferes 
less in my life ...

385
00:34:46.384 --> 00:34:49.970
when I pretend to be an upstanding
young citizen with a respectable job.

386
00:34:50.138 --> 00:34:51.889
Lester?!

387
00:34:55.018 --> 00:34:56.185
What are you doing?

388
00:34:56.352 --> 00:34:59.563
Honey, this ... Ricky Fitts.

389
00:35:01.024 --> 00:35:03.150
This is Ricky Fitts.

390
00:35:05.612 --> 00:35:08.697
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.

391
00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:10.574
I go to school with your daughter.

392
00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:13.869
With Jane?

393
00:35:14.037 --> 00:35:16.038
- Yeah. Jane.
- Really?

394
00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:19.958
Hi. I'm ready to go.

395
00:35:20.126 --> 00:35:21.710
I'll meet you out front.

396
00:35:26.883 --> 00:35:29.051
I'm in trouble!

397
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:34.223
Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts.
Thanks for the ... thing.

398
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.058
Anytime. Lester!

399
00:35:37.685 --> 00:35:40.020
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

400
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.580
Shit. They're home.
Quick, let's go up to my room.

401
00:35:58.748 --> 00:36:00.499
I should say hi to your dad.

402
00:36:01.376 --> 00:36:03.252
I don't want to be rude.

403
00:36:16.182 --> 00:36:17.307
Nice suit.

404
00:36:19.769 --> 00:36:21.520
You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.

405
00:36:21.688 --> 00:36:24.731
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

406
00:36:29.779 --> 00:36:31.238
Is that root beer?

407
00:37:31.007 --> 00:37:32.883
I love root beer, don't you?

408
00:37:35.511 --> 00:37:37.471
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

409
00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:39.640
You remember Angela?

410
00:37:39.807 --> 00:37:41.767
Yes, of course.

411
00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:44.311
I forgot to tell you, she's gonna
spend the night. Is that OK?

412
00:37:53.655 --> 00:37:55.280
Sorry about my dad.

413
00:37:55.448 --> 00:37:57.199
Don't be. I think it's funny.

414
00:37:58.326 --> 00:38:02.371
Yeah, to you, he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

415
00:38:02.538 --> 00:38:07.209
But to me, he's just ...
too embarrassing to live.

416
00:38:08.711 --> 00:38:12.422
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.

417
00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:14.466
But your dad's actually kind of cute.

418
00:38:14.634 --> 00:38:15.968
Shut up.

419
00:38:16.135 --> 00:38:19.638
He is. If he just worked out
a little, he'd be hot.

420
00:38:19.806 --> 00:38:21.807
- Shut up!
- Come on!

421
00:38:21.975 --> 00:38:24.393
Like you've never sneaked a peek
at him in his underwear?

422
00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.353
I bet he's got a big dick.

423
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:29.064
You are so grossing 
me out right now!

424
00:38:29.232 --> 00:38:32.359
If he built up his chest and arms,
I would totally fuck him!

425
00:38:32.527 --> 00:38:36.822
I would! I would suck
on your dad's big, fat dick ...

426
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:40.492
and then I'd fuck him until 
his eyes rolled back in his head!

427
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.744
Jane! What's that noise?

428
00:38:46.416 --> 00:38:49.042
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.

429
00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.837
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.

430
00:38:52.005 --> 00:38:55.674
No, I'm serious. See?

431
00:38:58.469 --> 00:39:00.762
- Oh, my God, Jane.
- What is it?

432
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:09.146
It's that psycho next door.
Jane, what if he worships you?

433
00:39:09.731 --> 00:39:12.357
What if he's got, like,
a shrine with pictures of you ...

434
00:39:12.525 --> 00:39:14.860
surrounded by
dead people's heads and stuff?

435
00:39:15.028 --> 00:39:17.946
Shit. I bet he's 
filming us right now.

436
00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.282
Really?

437
00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:54.543
Welcome to America's
Weirdest Home Videos.

438
00:41:21.237 --> 00:41:24.030
- Ricky?
- Coming, Dad.

439
00:41:25.408 --> 00:41:29.619
You know I don't like locked 
doors in my house, boy.

440
00:41:34.417 --> 00:41:36.835
I'm sorry. I must've locked it
by accident.

441
00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:40.088
So, what's up?

442
00:41:43.676 --> 00:41:45.927
I need a urine sample.

443
00:41:47.305 --> 00:41:50.515
Wow. It's been six months already.

444
00:41:52.101 --> 00:41:54.269
Can I give it to you in the
morning? I just took a whiz.

445
00:41:55.229 --> 00:41:56.771
Yeah, I suppose.

446
00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:02.611
You know ...

447
00:42:10.703 --> 00:42:14.080
Well ... Good night, Son.

448
00:43:21.023 --> 00:43:23.024
I've been waiting for you.

449
00:43:44.005 --> 00:43:46.172
You've been working 
out, haven't you?

450
00:43:46.340 --> 00:43:48.049
I could tell.

451
00:43:50.303 --> 00:43:52.387
I was hoping you'd give me a bath.

452
00:43:52.555 --> 00:43:55.515
I'm very, very dirty.

453
00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:30.884
What are you doing?

454
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:33.803
Nothing.

455
00:44:34.638 --> 00:44:36.431
You were masturbating.

456
00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:38.725
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.

457
00:44:40.394 --> 00:44:43.104
All right, so shoot me!
I was whacking off.

458
00:44:44.065 --> 00:44:47.609
That's right, I was choking 
the bishop. Chafing the carrot.

459
00:44:47.777 --> 00:44:50.612
You know, saying hi to my monster.

460
00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.698
- That's disgusting!
- Excuse me,

461
00:44:53.866 --> 00:44:56.743
but some of us still have blood
pumping through our veins!

462
00:44:56.911 --> 00:44:58.620
- So do I!
- Really?

463
00:44:58.788 --> 00:45:01.498
I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it!

464
00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:06.669
Lester, I refuse to live like this.

465
00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:08.213
This is not a marriage!

466
00:45:08.381 --> 00:45:11.466
This hasn't been a 
marriage for years.

467
00:45:11.634 --> 00:45:14.177
But you were happy
as long as I kept my mouth shut.

468
00:45:14.345 --> 00:45:19.140
Guess what? I've changed. And the
new me whacks off when he feels horny,

469
00:45:19.308 --> 00:45:22.102
'cause you're obviously not gonna
help me out in that department.

470
00:45:22.269 --> 00:45:24.813
I see. You think you're the only 
one who's sexually frustrated.

471
00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:28.066
I'm not? Well,
then come on, baby, I'm ready!

472
00:45:28.234 --> 00:45:30.193
Don't you mess with me, mister.

473
00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:33.488
I will divorce you so fast
it'll make your head spin!

474
00:45:33.656 --> 00:45:35.740
On what grounds?

475
00:45:35.908 --> 00:45:38.493
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

476
00:45:38.661 --> 00:45:40.703
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

477
00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:43.665
I don't even try to touch you
since you made it abundantly clear ...

478
00:45:43.833 --> 00:45:46.000
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!

479
00:45:48.337 --> 00:45:51.339
But I did support you
when you got your license.

480
00:45:51.507 --> 00:45:55.009
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

481
00:45:57.888 --> 00:46:01.683
So turn out the light
when you come back to bed, OK?

482
00:46:14.321 --> 00:46:16.030
It's a great thing when you realize ...

483
00:46:16.198 --> 00:46:19.033
you still have the ability
to surprise yourself.

484
00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:24.289
Makes you wonder what else you can 
do that you've forgotten about.

485
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:25.790
Hey, guys!

486
00:46:25.958 --> 00:46:29.377
- Lester, I didn't know you ran.
- I just started.

487
00:46:29.545 --> 00:46:30.712
Good for you.

488
00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.841
I figured you might be able to give me
some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast.

489
00:46:35.009 --> 00:46:37.177
Are you looking to just lose weight ...

490
00:46:37.344 --> 00:46:40.763
or do you want to have increased
strength and flexibility as well?

491
00:46:42.224 --> 00:46:44.058
I want to look good naked.

492
00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:00.992
What is this?

493
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.912
Fucking gay pride parade?

494
00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.915
Hey, Ricky.

495
00:47:09.668 --> 00:47:14.255
My life is passing before my eyes and
those two have barely broken a sweat.

496
00:47:14.423 --> 00:47:17.675
Sorry, hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

497
00:47:17.843 --> 00:47:19.677
Colonel Frank Fitts, 
US Marine Corps.

498
00:47:19.845 --> 00:47:22.263
Oh, well ...

499
00:47:23.224 --> 00:47:25.141
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

500
00:47:29.188 --> 00:47:30.688
Ricky ...

501
00:47:32.358 --> 00:47:36.069
I was thinking about ...
the movie we talked about.

502
00:47:36.237 --> 00:47:37.695
- Re-Animator.
- Yeah.

503
00:47:37.863 --> 00:47:39.989
You want to borrow it?
It's up in my room.

504
00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:41.741
- OK.
- Come on.

505
00:47:52.878 --> 00:47:54.629
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.

506
00:47:54.797 --> 00:47:57.757
I don't think my dad would come in
while someone else is here,

507
00:47:57.925 --> 00:48:00.593
but you never know.
- What is this?

508
00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:02.679
Urine.

509
00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:06.349
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

510
00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:10.103
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.

511
00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:12.313
It's not mine.

512
00:48:12.481 --> 00:48:16.025
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

513
00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:19.237
I cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

514
00:48:22.116 --> 00:48:23.783
You like Pink Floyd?

515
00:48:25.452 --> 00:48:27.078
I like a lot of music.

516
00:48:28.998 --> 00:48:32.000
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

517
00:48:33.502 --> 00:48:35.169
How much do you want?

518
00:48:36.005 --> 00:48:39.841
I don't know. It's been a while.
How much is an ounce?

519
00:48:43.804 --> 00:48:46.556
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.

520
00:48:49.685 --> 00:48:52.353
This shit is top-of-the-line.

521
00:48:52.521 --> 00:48:55.857
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the US government.

522
00:48:56.025 --> 00:48:59.902
It's extremely potent, but a 
completely mellow high. No paranoia.

523
00:49:01.697 --> 00:49:03.906
Is that what we smoked last night?

524
00:49:04.867 --> 00:49:06.659
This is all I ever smoke.

525
00:49:10.623 --> 00:49:14.083
- How much?
- Two grand.

526
00:49:14.251 --> 00:49:16.210
Jesus!

527
00:49:16.378 --> 00:49:19.339
Things have changed since 1973.

528
00:49:19.506 --> 00:49:21.883
You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.

529
00:49:22.051 --> 00:49:23.051
Thanks.

530
00:49:23.218 --> 00:49:25.470
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

531
00:49:25.638 --> 00:49:27.680
Beep me any time, day or night.

532
00:49:29.808 --> 00:49:31.225
And I only accept cash.

533
00:49:32.227 --> 00:49:34.437
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

534
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.068
When I was your age, I flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an 8-track.

535
00:49:40.235 --> 00:49:41.736
That sucks.

536
00:49:41.904 --> 00:49:44.322
No. Actually, it was great.

537
00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:48.201
All I did was party and get laid.

538
00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:52.622
I had my whole life ahead of me.

539
00:49:55.542 --> 00:49:58.252
My dad thinks I pay for all this
with catering jobs.

540
00:50:00.089 --> 00:50:02.382
Never underestimate 
the power of denial.

541
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.710
What the hell do you 
think you're doing?

542
00:50:41.296 --> 00:50:43.965
Mom's mad. Bench presses.

543
00:50:45.092 --> 00:50:48.428
I'm going to whale on my pecs,
and then I'm going to do my back.

544
00:50:49.346 --> 00:50:53.641
I see you're smoking pot now.
I'm so glad.

545
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:55.977
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances ...

546
00:50:56.145 --> 00:50:58.771
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

547
00:50:58.939 --> 00:51:03.067
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

548
00:51:05.446 --> 00:51:08.448
Lester, you have 
such hostility in you!

549
00:51:08.615 --> 00:51:11.159
Do you mind?
I'm trying to work out here.

550
00:51:11.326 --> 00:51:12.785
Unless you want to spot me.

551
00:51:12.953 --> 00:51:18.666
Lester, you will not get away 
with this! You can be sure of that!

552
00:51:20.502 --> 00:51:23.254
That's ... what ...

553
00:51:23.422 --> 00:51:25.298
you ... think.

554
00:51:26.133 --> 00:51:30.344
"My job consists
of basically masking my contempt ...

555
00:51:30.512 --> 00:51:32.930
for the assholes in charge ...

556
00:51:33.098 --> 00:51:35.349
and, at least once a day,

557
00:51:35.517 --> 00:51:39.020
retiring to the men's room
so I can jerk off ...

558
00:51:39.855 --> 00:51:44.609
while I fantasize about a life that 
doesn't so closely resemble hell."

559
00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.988
Well, you obviously have
no interest in saving yourself.

560
00:51:49.156 --> 00:51:53.409
Brad, for 14 years I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

561
00:51:53.577 --> 00:51:56.996
The only way I could save myself 
now is if I start firebombing.

562
00:51:57.164 --> 00:52:00.374
Whatever. Management wants you 
gone by the end of the day.

563
00:52:00.542 --> 00:52:04.045
What sort of severance package is 
management prepared to offer me ...

564
00:52:04.213 --> 00:52:07.173
considering the information I have
about our editorial director ...

565
00:52:07.341 --> 00:52:11.052
buying pussy with company money?
Which I think would interest the IRS,

566
00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.387
since it technically 
constitutes fraud.

567
00:52:13.555 --> 00:52:16.808
I'm sure that some of our advertisers
and rival publications ...

568
00:52:16.975 --> 00:52:20.937
might like to know about it as well.
Not to mention ... Craig's wife.

569
00:52:23.148 --> 00:52:27.318
- What do you want?
- One year's salary with benefits.

570
00:52:27.486 --> 00:52:29.237
That's not going to happen.

571
00:52:30.697 --> 00:52:33.950
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?

572
00:52:37.037 --> 00:52:39.747
- Against who?
- Against you.

573
00:52:40.582 --> 00:52:43.334
Can you prove that you
didn't offer to save my job ...

574
00:52:43.502 --> 00:52:45.920
if I let you blow me?

575
00:52:50.968 --> 00:52:54.428
Man ... You are one twisted fuck.

576
00:52:55.848 --> 00:52:57.265
Nope.

577
00:52:57.432 --> 00:53:00.852
I'm just an ordinary guy
with nothing to lose.

578
00:53:06.692 --> 00:53:08.150
Yeah!

579
00:53:14.366 --> 00:53:16.951
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

580
00:53:17.119 --> 00:53:18.953
I am so sorry to 
have kept you waiting.

581
00:53:21.874 --> 00:53:23.624
Christy left for 
New York this morning.

582
00:53:23.792 --> 00:53:27.211
Let's just say things were
a little hectic around the house.

583
00:53:27.379 --> 00:53:29.088
What's she doing in New York?

584
00:53:29.256 --> 00:53:32.925
She's moving there.
Yes. We are splitting up.

585
00:53:33.886 --> 00:53:37.346
- Buddy, I'm so sorry.
- Yes.

586
00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:41.434
According to her,
I'm too focused on my career.

587
00:53:42.561 --> 00:53:47.565
As if being driven to succeed
is some sort of a character flaw.

588
00:53:48.442 --> 00:53:52.820
She certainly did take advantage of
the lifestyle my success afforded her.

589
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.910
It's for the best.

590
00:54:01.246 --> 00:54:04.498
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

591
00:54:04.666 --> 00:54:06.417
Call me crazy ...

592
00:54:07.502 --> 00:54:12.089
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

593
00:54:12.257 --> 00:54:16.427
one must project an image
of success at all times.

594
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.282
What are you doing?

595
00:54:39.701 --> 00:54:41.369
I was filming this dead bird.

596
00:54:41.536 --> 00:54:42.954
Why?

597
00:54:43.121 --> 00:54:44.872
Because it's beautiful.

598
00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:51.003
I think maybe you forgot your 
medication today, mental-boy.

599
00:54:53.465 --> 00:54:54.715
Hi, Jane.

600
00:54:55.968 --> 00:54:57.927
Look, I want you 
to stop filming me.

601
00:55:00.222 --> 00:55:01.722
OK.

602
00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.350
Well, whatever. This is boring.

603
00:55:04.518 --> 00:55:06.018
Let's go.

604
00:55:07.312 --> 00:55:10.648
- Do you need a ride?
- Are you crazy?

605
00:55:10.816 --> 00:55:13.985
I don't want to end up hacked to 
pieces in a dumpster somewhere.

606
00:55:14.152 --> 00:55:17.530
It's OK. I'll walk. But thanks.

607
00:55:17.698 --> 00:55:19.949
See? He doesn't want to go anyway.
Come on. Let's go.

608
00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:23.452
Come on, Jane.

609
00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.037
I think I'm gonna walk, too.

610
00:55:26.373 --> 00:55:30.793
What? Jane, that's,
like, almost a mile!

611
00:55:46.768 --> 00:55:49.311
God! I love it!

612
00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:53.149
- You like getting nailed by the king?
- Yes, I love it!

613
00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:55.985
Fuck me, Your Majesty!

614
00:55:56.153 --> 00:55:57.486
- Who's the king?
- You are!

615
00:55:57.654 --> 00:55:59.071
Who's the king?

616
00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:17.631

617
00:56:17.799 --> 00:56:20.301

- Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's.
- What?

626
00:56:46.119 --> 00:56:48.454
Would you like to try
our new bacon and egg fajita,

627
00:56:48.622 --> 00:56:51.332
just $1.29 for a limited time only?

628
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.375
No, but thank you.

629
00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:57.338
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries, and an orange soda.

630
00:56:57.506 --> 00:56:59.590
Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.

631
00:57:01.843 --> 00:57:04.512
Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be $4.98, please.

632
00:57:07.974 --> 00:57:10.309
- Would you like some Smiley Sauce?
- No, no.

633
00:57:10.477 --> 00:57:12.770
Actually, I'd like
to fill out an application.

634
00:57:12.938 --> 00:57:15.272
There's no jobs for manager.
It's just for counter.

635
00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.941
Good.

636
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:21.278
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.

637
00:57:24.741 --> 00:57:26.367
I don't think you'd fit in here.

638
00:57:26.535 --> 00:57:29.745
I have fast-food experience.

639
00:57:29.913 --> 00:57:31.956
Yeah, like 20 years ago!

640
00:57:32.124 --> 00:57:36.043
I'm sure there have been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

641
00:57:36.211 --> 00:57:38.712
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

642
00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:41.590
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

643
00:57:45.929 --> 00:57:48.639
That was exactly what I needed.

644
00:57:52.144 --> 00:57:54.603
The royal treatment, so to speak.

645
00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:59.358
I was so stressed out.

646
00:58:07.534 --> 00:58:10.244
- Know what I do when I feel like that?
- What?

647
00:58:12.247 --> 00:58:14.290
I fire a gun.

648
00:58:14.457 --> 00:58:15.624
Really?

649
00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:17.710
Yeah, I go to this little
firing range downtown ...

650
00:58:17.878 --> 00:58:21.046
and I just pop off a few rounds.

651
00:58:22.507 --> 00:58:24.425
I've never fired a gun before.

652
00:58:24.593 --> 00:58:26.260
Well, you've got to try it.

653
00:58:26.428 --> 00:58:28.470
Nothing makes you 
feel more powerful.

654
00:58:31.433 --> 00:58:35.144
Well, almost nothing.

655
00:58:40.525 --> 00:58:42.610
So, do you like your new house?

656
00:58:42.777 --> 00:58:43.986
I like it.

657
00:58:44.154 --> 00:58:47.364
The people who used to live there fed
stray cats, so they were always around,

658
00:58:47.532 --> 00:58:50.451
and it drove my mother nuts.

659
00:58:50.619 --> 00:58:52.745
And then she cut down their tree.

660
00:58:54.456 --> 00:58:57.249
- Is that a funeral?
- Yeah.

661
00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:00.836
Have you ever known
anybody who died?

662
00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:02.963
No. Have you?

663
00:59:03.131 --> 00:59:04.924
No.

664
00:59:06.134 --> 00:59:08.844
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once.

665
00:59:09.012 --> 00:59:12.806
Just lying there on the sidewalk.
She looked really sad.

666
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:29.823
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

667
00:59:29.991 --> 00:59:32.034
Why would you film that?

668
00:59:32.202 --> 00:59:33.953
Because it was amazing.

669
00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.080
What's amazing about it?

670
00:59:36.248 --> 00:59:38.249
When you see something like that ...

671
00:59:38.416 --> 00:59:41.335
it's like God is looking right 
at you, just for a second.

672
00:59:42.337 --> 00:59:44.964
And if you're careful,
you can look right back.

673
00:59:45.131 --> 00:59:46.757
And what do you see?

674
00:59:48.093 --> 00:59:49.677
Beauty.

675
01:00:05.944 --> 01:00:08.529
Mom? I want you to meet somebody.

676
01:00:12.826 --> 01:00:15.703
- Mom?
- Yes.

677
01:00:17.998 --> 01:00:21.208
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.

678
01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:24.503
- Hi.
- Oh, my.

679
01:00:24.671 --> 01:00:27.464
I apologize for the way
things look around here.

680
01:00:38.143 --> 01:00:39.977
This is where my dad hides out.

681
01:00:40.895 --> 01:00:43.063
I take it he's got a thing for guns.

682
01:00:44.858 --> 01:00:46.525
You got to see this one thing.

683
01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.071
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.

684
01:00:52.365 --> 01:00:54.158
Did you steal his keys?

685
01:00:54.326 --> 01:00:57.077
No. One of my clients is a locksmith.

686
01:00:57.245 --> 01:00:59.830
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

687
01:01:14.554 --> 01:01:15.971
Turn it over.

688
01:01:20.018 --> 01:01:21.685
Oh, my God.

689
01:01:21.853 --> 01:01:24.813
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.

690
01:01:24.981 --> 01:01:28.484
There's a whole subculture of people
who collect this Nazi shit.

691
01:01:29.527 --> 01:01:31.737
But my dad just has this one thing.

692
01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:47.127
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

693
01:01:48.546 --> 01:01:52.174
- No, you're scared of me.
- No, I'm not.

694
01:01:53.635 --> 01:01:56.428
You want to see the most beautiful 
thing I've ever filmed?

695
01:02:21.121 --> 01:02:23.330
It was one of those days

696
01:02:23.498 --> 01:02:26.333
where it's a minute 
away from snowing ...

697
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:31.004
and there's this electricity
in the air.

698
01:02:34.175 --> 01:02:35.717
You can almost hear it.

699
01:02:36.678 --> 01:02:38.178
Right?

700
01:02:42.517 --> 01:02:44.226
And this bag was just ...

701
01:02:46.438 --> 01:02:48.605
dancing with me.

702
01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:53.777
Like a little kid,
begging me to play with it.

703
01:02:56.281 --> 01:02:58.365
For 15 minutes.

704
01:03:02.287 --> 01:03:04.746
That's the day I realized
that there was this ...

705
01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:09.543
entire life behind things ...

706
01:03:13.631 --> 01:03:16.550
and this incredibly 
benevolent force ...

707
01:03:17.635 --> 01:03:20.596
that wanted me to know that
there was no reason to be afraid ...

708
01:03:23.475 --> 01:03:25.058
ever.

709
01:03:27.979 --> 01:03:30.397
Video's a poor excuse, I know.

710
01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:35.194
But it helps me remember.

711
01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.200
I need to remember.

712
01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:50.709
Sometimes there is so much ...

713
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:56.089
beauty ... in the world.

714
01:03:59.052 --> 01:04:00.969
I feel like I can't take it.

715
01:04:05.767 --> 01:04:07.434
And my heart ...

716
01:04:08.603 --> 01:04:12.147
is just going to cave in.

717
01:04:59.988 --> 01:05:02.239
Oh, my God. What time is it?

718
01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:13.041
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's quite all right, dear.

719
01:05:14.085 --> 01:05:16.336
Your father and I were just
discussing his day at work.

720
01:05:16.504 --> 01:05:18.505
Why don't you tell our daughter
about it, honey?

721
01:05:18.673 --> 01:05:22.593
Janie, today I quit my job. Then 
I told my boss to go fuck himself ...

722
01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:25.679
and blackmailed him for almost $60,000.
Pass the asparagus.

723
01:05:25.847 --> 01:05:29.099
Your father seems to think this kind
of behavior is something to be proud of.

724
01:05:29.267 --> 01:05:32.144
Your mother seems to prefer
I go through life like a prisoner ...

725
01:05:32.312 --> 01:05:34.271
while she keeps my dick
in a jar under the sink.

726
01:05:34.439 --> 01:05:36.898
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her?

727
01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.526
I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me ...

728
01:05:39.694 --> 01:05:42.195
on the same day
that you lose your job!

729
01:05:42.363 --> 01:05:45.115
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Where'd my job go?" I quit!

730
01:05:45.283 --> 01:05:47.618
Someone pass the asparagus, please.

731
01:05:47.785 --> 01:05:50.037
Thank you for putting me
under the added pressure ...

732
01:05:50.204 --> 01:05:52.789
of being the sole breadwinner now.
- I already have a job.

733
01:05:52.957 --> 01:05:55.542
Don't give a second thought
as to who's gonna pay the mortgage.

734
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:57.294
We'll just leave 
it all to Carolyn!

735
01:05:57.462 --> 01:05:59.379
"You're gonna take 
care of everything?"

736
01:05:59.547 --> 01:06:00.797
"Yes, I don't mind."

737
01:06:00.965 --> 01:06:04.051
"You mean everything? You don't mind
having the sole responsibility?

738
01:06:04.218 --> 01:06:06.136
Your husband feels he
can quit his job ..."

739
01:06:06.304 --> 01:06:08.388
Will someone pass
the fucking asparagus?

740
01:06:08.556 --> 01:06:11.224
- I'm not gonna be a part of this.
- Sit down!

741
01:06:31.913 --> 01:06:34.748
I am sick and tired of being 
treated like I don't exist.

742
01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:38.001
You two do whatever you want 
to do whenever you want,

743
01:06:38.169 --> 01:06:39.920
and I don't complain. All I want ...

744
01:06:40.088 --> 01:06:42.589
You don't complain?
Please! Excuse me, excuse me!

745
01:06:42.757 --> 01:06:45.342
I must be psychotic! If you 
don't complain, what is this?

746
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.928
Yeah, let's bring 
in the laugh meter ...

747
01:06:48.096 --> 01:06:50.681
and see how loud it gets on 
that one! You don't ...

748
01:07:00.775 --> 01:07:02.859
Don't interrupt me, honey.

749
01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.834
And another thing.

750
01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:21.461
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music ...

751
01:07:21.629 --> 01:07:24.131
because, frankly,
and I don't think I'm alone here,

752
01:07:24.298 --> 01:07:26.883
I am really tired
of this Lawrence Welk shit.

753
01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:37.894
Go away!

754
01:07:38.062 --> 01:07:40.480
Honey, please let me in.

755
01:07:49.907 --> 01:07:54.745
I wish that you hadn't witnessed that
awful scene, but in a way, I'm glad.

756
01:07:54.912 --> 01:07:57.497
Why? So I can see what freaks 
you and Dad really are?

757
01:07:58.624 --> 01:08:00.125
Me?

758
01:08:03.171 --> 01:08:04.671
Oh, God.

759
01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:07.674
Christ, Mom.

760
01:08:08.634 --> 01:08:10.761
No, I'm glad because ...

761
01:08:13.181 --> 01:08:17.142
Because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

762
01:08:18.686 --> 01:08:30.030
You cannot count on anyone
except yourself.

763
01:08:32.158 --> 01:08:34.242
You know, it's sad but true.

764
01:08:35.203 --> 01:08:37.370
And the sooner you 
learn it, the better.

765
01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:41.500
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here, OK?

766
01:08:42.627 --> 01:08:44.336
You ungrateful little brat!

767
01:08:45.379 --> 01:08:47.547
Just look at everything you have!

768
01:08:47.715 --> 01:08:50.175
When I was your age,
I lived in a duplex!

769
01:08:50.343 --> 01:08:52.219
We didn't even have our own house.

770
01:10:55.259 --> 01:10:56.927
You little bastard!

771
01:10:57.094 --> 01:10:59.846
- No, I just ...
- How did you get in there?

772
01:11:00.014 --> 01:11:01.806
How? How?

773
01:11:03.893 --> 01:11:06.019
Come on, get up! Come on!

774
01:11:06.187 --> 01:11:07.979
Get up!

775
01:11:08.147 --> 01:11:10.023
Fight back, you little pussy!

776
01:11:10.191 --> 01:11:11.858
No, sir, I won't fight you!

777
01:11:12.026 --> 01:11:15.862
- How?! How did you get in there?
- I picked the lock, sir.

778
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:19.658
What were you looking for? Money?
Are you on dope again?

779
01:11:19.825 --> 01:11:22.994
No, sir. I wanted to show
my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

780
01:11:24.330 --> 01:11:27.624
- A girlfriend?
- Yes, sir. She lives next door.

781
01:11:41.305 --> 01:11:42.639
Her name's Jane.

782
01:12:02.994 --> 01:12:05.286
This is for your own good, boy.

783
01:12:08.207 --> 01:12:13.294
You have no respect for other 
people's things and for authority.

784
01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:14.754
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

785
01:12:14.922 --> 01:12:19.050
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like!

786
01:12:19.218 --> 01:12:23.179
- You can't! There are rules in life.
- Yes, sir.

787
01:12:26.434 --> 01:12:29.269
You need structure, yeah.

788
01:12:29.437 --> 01:12:31.688
- You need discipline!
- Discipline. Yes, sir.

789
01:12:31.856 --> 01:12:34.941
Thank you for trying to teach me.
Don't give up on me, Dad.

790
01:12:40.448 --> 01:12:41.948
Ricky ...

791
01:12:47.038 --> 01:12:49.664
You stay out of there!

792
01:13:38.422 --> 01:13:42.175
I gotta say, when you first came here,
I thought you would be hopeless.

793
01:13:42.343 --> 01:13:43.551
But you're a natural.

794
01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:47.097
Well, all I know is,

Whose car is that out front?

811
01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:07.760
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,

812
01:15:07.928 --> 01:15:10.430
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.

813
01:15:10.598 --> 01:15:13.057
- I rule.
- Where's the Camry?

814
01:15:13.225 --> 01:15:15.268
I traded it in.

815
01:15:15.436 --> 01:15:17.645
Shouldn't you have 
consulted me first?

816
01:15:18.397 --> 01:15:19.772
Let me think.

817
01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.983
No. You never drove it.

818
01:15:24.069 --> 01:15:26.779
Have you done something 
different? You look great.

819
01:15:32.119 --> 01:15:33.828
Where's Jane?

820
01:15:34.455 --> 01:15:36.289
Jane not home.

821
01:15:42.796 --> 01:15:44.547
We have ...

822
01:15:47.468 --> 01:15:49.552
the whole house ...

823
01:15:50.554 --> 01:15:52.639
to ourselves.

824
01:15:55.309 --> 01:15:57.101
Christ, Carolyn.

825
01:15:58.145 --> 01:15:59.812
When did you become so ...

826
01:16:02.233 --> 01:16:04.025
joyless?

827
01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:07.862
Joyless?

828
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:09.697
I am not joyless.

829
01:16:10.908 --> 01:16:12.992
There happens to be a lot about me ...

830
01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.120
that you don't know, Mr. Smarty Man.

831
01:16:17.331 --> 01:16:20.166
There is plenty of joy in my life.

832
01:16:23.087 --> 01:16:24.963
Whatever happened to that girl ...

833
01:16:28.592 --> 01:16:32.887
who used to fake seizures at 
frat parties when she got bored?

834
01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:39.352
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building ...

835
01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:42.188
to flash the traffic helicopters?

836
01:16:43.816 --> 01:16:46.317
Have you totally 
forgotten about her?

837
01:16:46.485 --> 01:16:48.903
Because I haven't.

838
01:17:02.126 --> 01:17:04.669
Lester, you're gonna
spill beer on the couch.

839
01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:14.345
So what? It's just a couch.

840
01:17:16.724 --> 01:17:21.394
This is a $4,000 sofa
upholstered in Italian silk!

841
01:17:21.562 --> 01:17:23.062
This is not just a couch!

842
01:17:23.230 --> 01:17:26.899
It's just a couch!

843
01:17:27.067 --> 01:17:29.235
This isn't life!

844
01:17:29.403 --> 01:17:31.404
This is just stuff.

845
01:17:31.572 --> 01:17:36.117
And it's become more important to you
than living. Honey, that's just nuts.

846
01:17:45.586 --> 01:17:48.004
I'm only trying to help you!

847
01:17:54.094 --> 01:17:56.137
Don't.

848
01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:57.638
Why?

849
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:05.938
It's weird watching myself.
I don't like how I look.

850
01:18:08.859 --> 01:18:11.527
Can't believe you don't know
how beautiful you are.

851
01:18:11.695 --> 01:18:14.781
Look, I'm not gonna
sit here for that shit.

852
01:18:25.459 --> 01:18:27.710
How does it feel now?

853
01:18:27.878 --> 01:18:30.963
- Fine.
- You don't feel naked?

854
01:18:32.549 --> 01:18:34.092
I am naked.

855
01:18:34.259 --> 01:18:36.427
You know what I mean.

856
01:18:46.063 --> 01:18:48.481
So tell me about 
being in the hospital.

857
01:18:52.444 --> 01:18:56.155
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

858
01:18:56.323 --> 01:18:59.742
He totally freaked and decided 
to send me to military school.

859
01:19:01.703 --> 01:19:05.039
I told you his thing about 
structure and discipline, right?

860
01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:08.334
Well, of course, I got kicked out.

861
01:19:09.586 --> 01:19:11.254
Dad and I had this huge fight.

862
01:19:11.422 --> 01:19:13.756
He hit me.

863
01:19:13.924 --> 01:19:18.511
And the next day at school, some 
kid made a crack about my haircut.

864
01:19:20.472 --> 01:19:22.223
And I just snapped.

865
01:19:26.311 --> 01:19:28.104
I wanted to kill him.

866
01:19:29.815 --> 01:19:31.941
I would've killed him ...

867
01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:36.154
if they hadn't pulled me off.

868
01:19:39.867 --> 01:19:43.327
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.

869
01:19:43.495 --> 01:19:46.873
They drugged me up and
left me in there for two years.

870
01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:53.463
You must really hate him.

871
01:19:57.468 --> 01:19:59.510
He's not a bad man.

872
01:19:59.678 --> 01:20:03.473
You'd better believe I'd hate my dad
if he did something like that to me.

873
01:20:05.392 --> 01:20:07.727
Wait. I already do hate my dad.

874
01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:11.272
Why?

875
01:20:14.568 --> 01:20:16.235
He's a total asshole.

876
01:20:16.403 --> 01:20:20.323
He's got this crush on my friend 
Angela, and it's disgusting.

877
01:20:20.491 --> 01:20:22.700
You'd rather he had 
the crush on you.

878
01:20:24.244 --> 01:20:26.204
Gross. No.

879
01:20:29.917 --> 01:20:33.252
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere 
near as important to him as she is.

880
01:20:37.549 --> 01:20:40.968
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

881
01:20:42.596 --> 01:20:45.598
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

882
01:20:46.767 --> 01:20:48.142
How?

883
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:51.687
Well, now, I, too, need structure.

884
01:20:51.855 --> 01:20:53.814
A little fucking discipline.

885
01:21:05.369 --> 01:21:07.036
I'm serious, though.

886
01:21:08.247 --> 01:21:10.414
How could he not be damaging me?

887
01:21:13.126 --> 01:21:15.795
I need a father who's a role model.

888
01:21:15.963 --> 01:21:18.297
Not some horny geek-boy
who's gonna spray his shorts ...

889
01:21:18.465 --> 01:21:21.133
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

890
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:25.137
What a lame-o.

891
01:21:28.267 --> 01:21:31.269
Someone really should just
put him out of his misery.

892
01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:36.816
Want me to kill him for you?

893
01:21:46.159 --> 01:21:48.286
Yeah. Would you?

894
01:21:50.330 --> 01:21:51.956
It'll cost you.

895
01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:54.500
I've been babysitting
since I was about ten.

896
01:21:54.668 --> 01:21:57.461
I've got almost $3,000.

897
01:22:00.841 --> 01:22:02.675
Course, I was saving it up
for a boob job.

898
01:22:04.595 --> 01:22:06.637
But ...

899
01:22:20.027 --> 01:22:22.528
You know, that's not
a very nice thing to do.

900
01:22:25.866 --> 01:22:27.825
Hiring someone to kill your dad.

901
01:22:31.121 --> 01:22:33.873
I guess I'm not
a very nice girl, then, am I?

902
01:22:58.398 --> 01:23:00.733
You know I'm not serious, right?

903
01:23:01.902 --> 01:23:03.694
Of course.

904
01:23:18.669 --> 01:23:21.003
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?

905
01:23:27.469 --> 01:23:29.136
Remember those posters that said:

906
01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:32.556
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life"?

907
01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:37.478
Well, that's true
of every day except one:

908
01:23:38.772 --> 01:23:40.398
The day you die.

909
01:24:19.896 --> 01:24:21.605
Jane, hurry up.

910
01:24:21.773 --> 01:24:24.233
I've got a very important appointment.

911
01:24:24.401 --> 01:24:27.027
Mom, is it OK
if Angela sleeps over tonight?

912
01:24:27.195 --> 01:24:29.321
Well, of course. 
She's always welcome.

913
01:24:29.489 --> 01:24:33.284
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

914
01:24:40.792 --> 01:24:43.502
- What?
- I've been too embarrassed ...

915
01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:46.005
to bring her over.

916
01:24:46.173 --> 01:24:48.841
Because of you
and that way you behave.

917
01:24:49.009 --> 01:24:51.677
What are you talking about?
I've barely even spoken to her.

918
01:24:51.845 --> 01:24:55.097
You stare at her all the time!
Like you're drunk!

919
01:24:55.265 --> 01:24:57.183
- It's disgusting!
- Watch yourself, Jane,

920
01:24:57.350 --> 01:25:00.561
or you're gonna turn into a real 
bitch, just like your mother!

921
01:25:05.192 --> 01:25:06.358
Fuck.

922
01:25:14.367 --> 01:25:15.951
You ready to go?

923
01:25:17.621 --> 01:25:20.956
I don't need a ride. I'm going 
in with Jane and her mom.

924
01:25:29.049 --> 01:25:30.549
Oh, morning.

925
01:25:31.802 --> 01:25:35.429
- Hey, Ricky. How's it going?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

926
01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:37.014
Hey, hey.

927
01:26:56.469 --> 01:26:59.221
I need that Super Smiley
with cheese ASAP!

928
01:26:59.389 --> 01:27:01.640
You need more than that,
my little hombre.

929
01:27:01.808 --> 01:27:05.102
- Yeah. What's good here?
- Nothing!

930
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:08.355
Then I guess we'll
just have to be bad, won't we?

931
01:27:09.566 --> 01:27:11.817
I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,

932
01:27:11.985 --> 01:27:14.278
curly fries and a vanilla shake.
- Make that two!

933
01:27:14.446 --> 01:27:17.364
That'll be $7.98. Please drive 
up to the window. Thank you.

934
01:27:18.491 --> 01:27:22.828
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.

935
01:27:24.623 --> 01:27:27.166
- Did you know that?
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

936
01:27:28.668 --> 01:27:30.961
Smile! You're at Mister Smiley's!

937
01:27:33.465 --> 01:27:35.925
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?

938
01:27:36.092 --> 01:27:38.302
Just $1.99 for a 
limited time only?

939
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:40.846
We were just at a seminar.

940
01:27:41.014 --> 01:27:43.349
- Buddy, this is my ...
- Her husband.

941
01:27:43.516 --> 01:27:45.267
We've met before,

942
01:27:45.435 --> 01:27:49.396
but something tells me you're 
going to remember me this time.

943
01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:53.525
You are so busted.

944
01:27:53.693 --> 01:27:55.653
This really doesn't concern you!

945
01:27:55.820 --> 01:28:00.449
Actually, Janine is senior drive-thru
manager, so you kind of are on her turf.

946
01:28:04.871 --> 01:28:07.206
So, this makes sense.

947
01:28:07.374 --> 01:28:09.833
- Oh, Lester ...
- Honey, it's OK.

948
01:28:10.001 --> 01:28:11.961
I want you to be happy.

949
01:28:12.128 --> 01:28:15.172
- Would you like Smiley sauce with that?
- Lester, just stop it!

950
01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:17.216
No, no. You ...

951
01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:21.011
don't get to tell me what to do ...

952
01:28:21.179 --> 01:28:23.263
ever again.

953
01:28:37.529 --> 01:28:39.196
I'm sorry.

954
01:28:41.074 --> 01:28:43.283
I guess we should 
cool it for a while.

955
01:28:46.204 --> 01:28:48.998
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.

956
01:28:49.165 --> 01:28:51.917
No. I understand completely.

957
01:28:54.838 --> 01:28:56.213
In order to be successful,

958
01:28:56.381 --> 01:28:59.049
one must project an image
of success at all times.

959
01:29:25.952 --> 01:29:27.911
Stop it. Stop it.

960
01:30:09.329 --> 01:30:10.329
Shit.

961
01:30:17.337 --> 01:30:19.421
I have to run next door.

962
01:30:19.589 --> 01:30:22.674
Jane left her geometry book in my bag.
She needs it to do her homework.

963
01:30:33.269 --> 01:30:37.606
You and psycho-boy are fucking
on a regular basis now, right?

964
01:30:37.774 --> 01:30:41.026
- No.
- Come on, you can tell me.

965
01:30:41.194 --> 01:30:42.194
Does he have a big dick?

966
01:30:42.362 --> 01:30:46.740
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, OK? It's not like that.

967
01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:49.451
Not like what? 
Doesn't he have one?

968
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:52.204
Why don't you want 
to talk about it?

969
01:30:52.372 --> 01:30:54.873
I tell you every single detail
about every guy that I fuck.

970
01:30:55.041 --> 01:30:58.085
Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't,
all right?

971
01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:00.504
Maybe I really don't want
to hear about all that.

972
01:31:00.672 --> 01:31:04.007
So now that you have a 
boyfriend, you're above it?

973
01:31:05.385 --> 01:31:07.219
We got to get you a real man.

974
01:31:28.825 --> 01:31:30.409
- You got any papers?
- Yeah.

975
01:31:30.577 --> 01:31:32.411
In the cigar box right over there.

976
01:31:32.579 --> 01:31:34.997
Put up a fight, dude.
You are such a pushover.

977
01:31:35.165 --> 01:31:36.915
"No, I can't, really, no. OK."

978
01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:39.418
You should learn to roll a joint.

979
01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:46.109
- Hi.
- Where's Mom?

980
01:32:47.278 --> 01:32:49.488
- Don't know.
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.

981
01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:53.325
- Hi.
- Wow. Look at you.

982
01:32:54.410 --> 01:32:56.828
- Have you been working out?
- Some.

983
01:33:02.126 --> 01:33:03.961
You can really tell.

984
01:33:07.006 --> 01:33:08.674
Look at those arms.

985
01:33:13.179 --> 01:33:15.347
You like muscles?

986
01:33:17.433 --> 01:33:20.769
I should probably go see
what Jane's up to.

987
01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:35.158
Where did you get that?

988
01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:38.787
From my job.

989
01:33:38.955 --> 01:33:40.914
You don't lie to me.

990
01:33:43.042 --> 01:33:44.584
Now, I saw you with him.

991
01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:48.380
You were watching me?

992
01:33:50.049 --> 01:33:51.842
What did he make you do?

993
01:33:55.138 --> 01:33:57.180
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham ...

994
01:33:57.348 --> 01:33:59.224
Don't you laugh at me!

995
01:34:00.768 --> 01:34:05.397
Now, I will not sit back and watch
my only son become a cocksucker!

996
01:34:05.565 --> 01:34:06.940
Jesus! What is it with you?

997
01:34:11.821 --> 01:34:15.365
I swear to God I'll throw you out of
this house and never look at you again!

998
01:34:15.533 --> 01:34:19.494
- You mean that.
- You're damn straight I do!

999
01:34:19.662 --> 01:34:23.081
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fucking faggot!

1000
01:34:34.927 --> 01:34:36.345
You're right.

1001
01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:43.226
- I suck dick for money.
- Boy, don't start!

1002
01:34:43.394 --> 01:34:45.896
$2,000. I'm that good.

1003
01:34:46.064 --> 01:34:47.189
Get out!

1004
01:34:47.357 --> 01:34:49.524
And you should see me fuck!

1005
01:34:49.692 --> 01:34:51.735
I'm the best piece of ass
in three states!

1006
01:34:51.903 --> 01:34:55.614
Damn it, get out! I don't 
ever want to see you again!

1007
01:35:01.746 --> 01:35:05.415
What a sad old man you are.

1008
01:35:07.293 --> 01:35:09.503
Get out.

1009
01:35:34.737 --> 01:35:36.196
Mom ...

1010
01:35:37.698 --> 01:35:40.242
- I'm leaving.
- OK.

1011
01:35:43.663 --> 01:35:45.247
Wear a raincoat.

1012
01:35:52.630 --> 01:35:55.215
I wish things would have
been better for you.

1013
01:35:59.679 --> 01:36:01.263
Take care of Dad.

1014
01:36:33.212 --> 01:36:35.714
disinvesting problems of power ...

1015
01:36:35.882 --> 01:36:38.717
and removing their ability
to make us afraid.

1016
01:36:38.885 --> 01:36:42.095
This is the secret
to "Me-Centered Living."

1017
01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:47.225
Only by taking full responsibility
for your actions and their solutions ...

1018
01:36:47.393 --> 01:36:51.480
will you ever break free from
the constant cycle of victimhood.

1019
01:36:51.647 --> 01:36:56.818
You are only a victim if you choose to 
be a victim. We all have the power ...

1020
01:36:56.986 --> 01:37:01.531
I don't think we can be friends anymore.
You're way too uptight about sex.

1021
01:37:01.699 --> 01:37:05.035
Just don't fuck my dad, all right?

1022
01:37:05.203 --> 01:37:07.120
- Please?
- Why not?

1023
01:37:08.623 --> 01:37:11.666
- Dad, leave us alone!
- It's me.

1024
01:37:13.586 --> 01:37:15.670
If I had to leave tonight,
would you come with me?

1025
01:37:15.838 --> 01:37:18.423
- What?
- If I had to go to New York to live,

1026
01:37:18.591 --> 01:37:20.258
tonight, would you come with me?

1027
01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.889
- Yes.
- You guys can't be serious!

1028
01:37:26.057 --> 01:37:28.433
You're just a kid,
and he's, like, a mental case.

1029
01:37:28.601 --> 01:37:30.852
You'll end up living in a box
on the street.

1030
01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:34.773
I'm no more a kid than you are!
We can use my plastic surgery money.

1031
01:37:34.941 --> 01:37:37.567
We won't have to.
I have over $40,000.

1032
01:37:37.735 --> 01:37:39.611
I know people in the city
that can help us.

1033
01:37:39.779 --> 01:37:42.030
- What, other drug dealers?
- Yes.

1034
01:37:42.198 --> 01:37:44.449
Jane, you'd be out of your mind
to go with him.

1035
01:37:44.617 --> 01:37:47.410
- Why do you even care?
- Because you're my friend!

1036
01:37:47.578 --> 01:37:51.373
She's not your friend. She's someone
you use to feel better about yourself.

1037
01:37:51.541 --> 01:37:54.793
- Go fuck yourself, psycho!
- Shut up, bitch!

1038
01:37:54.961 --> 01:37:57.837
- Jane! He's a freak!
- Well, then so am I!

1039
01:37:58.005 --> 01:38:01.466
And we'll always be freaks, and 
we'll never be like other people.

1040
01:38:01.634 --> 01:38:05.303
And you'll never be a freak
'cause you're just too perfect!

1041
01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:09.683
Yeah, well, at least I'm not ugly.

1042
01:38:11.978 --> 01:38:13.687
Yes, you are.

1043
01:38:13.854 --> 01:38:17.190
And you're boring.
And you're totally ordinary.

1044
01:38:18.526 --> 01:38:20.235
And you know it.

1045
01:38:22.405 --> 01:38:24.573
You two deserve each other.

1046
01:39:25.426 --> 01:39:27.218
Jesus, man, you're soaked!

1047
01:39:38.397 --> 01:39:40.732
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.

1048
01:39:43.402 --> 01:39:45.278
Are you OK?

1049
01:39:45.446 --> 01:39:47.572
Where's your wife?

1050
01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:51.326
I don't know.

1051
01:39:51.494 --> 01:39:54.496
Probably out fucking that dorky
prince-of-real-estate asshole.

1052
01:39:56.707 --> 01:39:58.208
And you know what?

1053
01:39:59.919 --> 01:40:01.211
I don't care.

1054
01:40:11.806 --> 01:40:15.934
Your wife is with another man
and you don't care?

1055
01:40:19.105 --> 01:40:20.438
Nope.

1056
01:40:20.606 --> 01:40:23.274
Our marriage is just for show.

1057
01:40:24.443 --> 01:40:27.487
A commercial for 
how normal we are ...

1058
01:40:27.655 --> 01:40:29.614
when we're anything but.

1059
01:40:37.498 --> 01:40:39.457
Jesus, man, you are shaking.

1060
01:40:40.126 --> 01:40:42.961
We really ought to get you
out of these clothes.

1061
01:40:43.129 --> 01:40:44.629
Yeah.

1062
01:40:46.549 --> 01:40:48.299
It's OK.

1063
01:40:52.054 --> 01:40:53.805
I am ...

1064
01:40:55.641 --> 01:40:57.809
You just tell me what you need.

1065
01:41:02.064 --> 01:41:03.773
It's OK.

1066
01:41:25.337 --> 01:41:26.963
I'm sorry.

1067
01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:30.049
You got the wrong idea.

1068
01:42:07.296 --> 01:42:09.756
"I refuse to be a victim."

1069
01:42:09.924 --> 01:42:13.843
When this becomes your mantra,
constantly reinforcing your ...

1070
01:42:17.932 --> 01:42:21.100
I refuse to be a victim!

1071
01:43:05.187 --> 01:43:07.689
I hope you don't mind
if I play the stereo.

1072
01:43:07.857 --> 01:43:09.691
Not at all.

1073
01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.486
Bad night?

1074
01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:14.988
Not really bad. Just ...

1075
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:18.449
strange.

1076
01:43:18.617 --> 01:43:22.787
Believe me, it couldn't possibly
be any stranger than mine.

1077
01:43:31.714 --> 01:43:33.298
Jane and I had a fight.

1078
01:43:35.301 --> 01:43:36.634
It was about you.

1079
01:43:39.471 --> 01:43:41.014
She's mad at me because ...

1080
01:43:42.808 --> 01:43:44.642
I said I think you're sexy.

1081
01:43:47.855 --> 01:43:51.357
- Do you want a sip?
- Sure.

1082
01:44:20.429 --> 01:44:21.888
So ...

1083
01:44:24.308 --> 01:44:26.225
are you going to tell me?

1084
01:44:29.647 --> 01:44:31.522
What do you want?

1085
01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:36.694
I don't know.

1086
01:44:38.948 --> 01:44:40.198
You ...

1087
01:44:40.824 --> 01:44:42.325
don't know.

1088
01:44:43.535 --> 01:44:45.787
What do you want?

1089
01:44:47.206 --> 01:44:48.331
Are you kidding?

1090
01:44:50.292 --> 01:44:52.043
I want you.

1091
01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:59.258
I've wanted you
since the first moment I saw you.

1092
01:45:02.346 --> 01:45:05.306
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1093
01:45:13.565 --> 01:45:15.566
You don't think I'm ordinary?

1094
01:45:18.737 --> 01:45:21.447
You couldn't be 
ordinary if you tried.

1095
01:45:24.743 --> 01:45:26.661
Thank you.

1096
01:45:27.871 --> 01:45:30.790
I don't think there's anything worse
than being ordinary.

1097
01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:53.813
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.

1098
01:45:53.981 --> 01:45:55.898
I refuse to be a victim.

1099
01:45:56.066 --> 01:46:00.153
Lester ... I have something
I have to say to you.

1100
01:46:50.871 --> 01:46:52.371
Are you scared?

1101
01:46:53.499 --> 01:46:55.333
I don't get scared.

1102
01:46:58.504 --> 01:47:00.338
My parents will try to find me.

1103
01:47:01.173 --> 01:47:02.882
Mine won't.

1104
01:47:24.363 --> 01:47:26.364
This is my first time.

1105
01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:31.953
You're kidding.

1106
01:47:32.121 --> 01:47:33.871
I'm sorry.

1107
01:47:34.832 --> 01:47:36.374
I still want to do it.

1108
01:47:36.542 --> 01:47:38.042
I just ...

1109
01:47:38.210 --> 01:47:43.005
thought I should tell you,
in case you wondered why I wasn't ...

1110
01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.384
better.

1111
01:47:58.647 --> 01:48:00.231
What's wrong?

1112
01:48:06.989 --> 01:48:09.031
I thought you said I was beautiful.

1113
01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:12.827
You are beautiful.

1114
01:48:15.706 --> 01:48:17.415
You are so ...

1115
01:48:18.208 --> 01:48:19.709
beautiful.

1116
01:48:22.546 --> 01:48:24.422
And I would be a very ...

1117
01:48:25.799 --> 01:48:26.924
lucky man.

1118
01:48:28.343 --> 01:48:30.595
I feel so stupid.

1119
01:48:30.762 --> 01:48:32.597
Don't.

1120
01:48:34.766 --> 01:48:36.601
I'm sorry.

1121
01:48:36.768 --> 01:48:39.270
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1122
01:48:40.939 --> 01:48:42.607
It's OK.

1123
01:48:43.901 --> 01:48:46.110
Everything's OK.

1124
01:49:02.127 --> 01:49:04.629
Wow. I was starving.

1125
01:49:05.964 --> 01:49:09.467
- Do you want me to make another one?
- No, I'm fine.

1126
01:49:09.635 --> 01:49:10.843
You sure?

1127
01:49:12.095 --> 01:49:15.556
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better.

1128
01:49:15.724 --> 01:49:17.099
Thanks.

1129
01:49:20.604 --> 01:49:21.854
How's Jane?

1130
01:49:23.190 --> 01:49:24.273
What do you mean?

1131
01:49:25.817 --> 01:49:26.984
I mean ...

1132
01:49:28.278 --> 01:49:30.571
how's her life?

1133
01:49:30.739 --> 01:49:32.365
Is she happy?

1134
01:49:32.532 --> 01:49:34.659
Is she miserable?

1135
01:49:36.370 --> 01:49:40.456
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

1136
01:49:43.752 --> 01:49:48.339
She's ... she is really happy.

1137
01:49:49.841 --> 01:49:51.342
She thinks she's in love.

1138
01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:05.856
Good for her.

1139
01:50:09.695 --> 01:50:10.861
How are you?

1140
01:50:18.829 --> 01:50:21.622
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

1141
01:50:28.714 --> 01:50:30.131
I'm great.

1142
01:50:37.222 --> 01:50:38.597
I've got to go to the bathroom.

1143
01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:54.613
I'm great.

1144
01:51:29.441 --> 01:51:31.067
Man, oh, man.

1145
01:51:34.446 --> 01:51:37.156
Man, oh, man, oh, man.

1146
01:52:13.568 --> 01:52:15.027
Oh, my God!

1147
01:53:00.782 --> 01:53:04.076
I had always heard your entire life
flashes in front of your eyes ...

1148
01:53:04.244 --> 01:53:06.245
the second before you die.

1149
01:53:07.789 --> 01:53:08.998
First of all ...

1150
01:53:09.166 --> 01:53:12.543
that one second
isn't a second at all.

1151
01:53:13.295 --> 01:53:17.798
It stretches on forever,
like an ocean of time.

1152
01:53:20.218 --> 01:53:24.430
For me, it was lying on my back
at Boy Scout camp ...

1153
01:53:24.598 --> 01:53:26.891
watching falling stars.

1154
01:53:35.567 --> 01:53:40.654
And yellow leaves from the
maple trees that lined our street.

1155
01:53:50.123 --> 01:53:55.044
Or my grandmother's hands and the 
way her skin seemed like paper.

1156
01:54:02.928 --> 01:54:06.764
And the first time
I saw my cousin Tony's ...

1157
01:54:06.932 --> 01:54:09.767
brand-new Firebird.

1158
01:54:21.571 --> 01:54:26.909
And Janie.

1159
01:54:58.984 --> 01:55:01.110
And Carolyn.

1160
01:55:06.324 --> 01:55:09.952
I guess I could be pretty pissed 
off about what happened to me,

1161
01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:14.415
but it's hard to stay mad when
there's so much beauty in the world.

1162
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:20.045
Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it
all at once, and it's too much.

1163
01:55:21.006 --> 01:55:24.383
My heart fills up like a balloon
that's about to burst.

1164
01:55:26.261 --> 01:55:29.346
And then I remember to relax ...

1165
01:55:30.432 --> 01:55:33.100
and stop trying to hold on to it.

1166
01:55:33.268 --> 01:55:36.186
And then it flows
through me like rain ...

1167
01:55:37.355 --> 01:55:40.190
and I can't feel 
anything but gratitude ...

1168
01:55:40.358 --> 01:55:45.738
for every single moment
of my stupid little life.

1169
01:55:47.198 --> 01:55:49.867
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, I'm sure.

1170
01:55:51.369 --> 01:55:52.536
But don't worry.

1171
01:55:53.872 --> 01:55:55.748
You will some day.
