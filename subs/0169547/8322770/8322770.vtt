00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.552
I need a father who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy...

2
00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:41.307
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girlfriend home from school.

3
00:00:42.892 --> 00:00:45.311
What a lame-o.

4
00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.651
Someone really should just put him
out of his misery.

5
00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:57.156
<i>You want me to kill him for you?</i>

6
00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.666
Yeah. Would you?

7
00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.473
<i>My name is Lester Burnham.</i>

8
00:01:22.557 --> 00:01:25.726
<i>This is my neighborhood.</i>

9
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.729
<i>This is my street.</i>

10
00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:31.649
<i>This is my life.</i>

11
00:01:31.732 --> 00:01:36.737
<i>I'm 42 years old.</i>
<i>In less than a year, I'll be dead.</i>

12
00:01:43.828 --> 00:01:47.081
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>I don't know that yet.</i>

13
00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:54.672
<i>And in a way,</i>
<i>I'm dead already.</i>

14
00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:07.977
<i>Look at me:</i>
<i>jerking off in the shower.</i>

15
00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:14.859
<i>This will be the high point of my day.</i>
<i>It's all downhill from here.</i>

16
00:02:19.363 --> 00:02:22.492
<i>That's my wife, Carolyn.</i>

17
00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:27.580
<i>See the way the handle on those pruning</i>
<i>shears matches her gardening clogs?</i>

18
00:02:27.663 --> 00:02:30.708
<i>That's not an accident.</i>

19
00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:33.336
<i>Hush, Bitsy!</i>

20
00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.298
- Hush. What is wrong with you?
- <i>That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.</i>

21
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:41.302
<i>And that's his lover, Jim.</i>

22
00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:44.847
- You spoil her. Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me?

23
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:47.892
- <i>Come on. Yes. Inside.</i>
- <i>Good morning, Jim!</i>

24
00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.144
Good morning, Carolyn.

25
00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:54.440
I love your tie!
That color!

26
00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:59.028
I just love your roses. How do you
get them to flourish like this?

27
00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.824
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

28
00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:07.411
- I've never heard that.
- <i>Man, I get exhausted just watching her.</i>

29
00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:11.582
<i>She wasn't always like this.</i>
<i>She used to be happy.</i>

30
00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:17.380
We <i>used to be happy.</i>

31
00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:21.634
<i>My daughter Jane.</i>
<i>Only child.</i>

32
00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:27.390
<i>Janie's a pretty typical teenager:</i>

33
00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:31.727
<i>angry, insecure, confused.</i>

34
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:37.024
<i>I wish I could tell her that's all going</i>
<i>to pass, but I don't want to lie to her.</i>

35
00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:44.115
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?

36
00:03:44.198 --> 00:03:48.369
- Yes.
- Congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.

37
00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:52.915
Lester, could you make me a little later,
please, because I'm not quite late enough.

38
00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.588
Nice going, Dad.

39
00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:02.925
<i>Both my wife and</i>
<i>daughter think I'm this gigantic loser.</i>

40
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.970
<i>And they're right.</i>

41
00:04:06.053 --> 00:04:09.432
<i>I have lost something.</i>

42
00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.602
<i>I'm not exactly sure</i>
<i>what it is,</i>

43
00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:16.230
<i>but I know</i>
<i>I didn't always feel this...</i>

44
00:04:16.314 --> 00:04:18.232
<i>sedated.</i>

45
00:04:18.316 --> 00:04:21.027
<i>But you know what?</i>

46
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.615
<i>It's never too late</i>
<i>to get it back.</i>

47
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.993
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from <i>Media Monthly</i> magazine.

48
00:04:29.076 --> 00:04:32.121
I'm calling
for Mr. Tamblin, please.

49
00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:35.792
Well, we're all under a deadline here.
You see, there's some basic information...

50
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:40.296
about your product launch that isn't even
covered in your press release, and I'd...

51
00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:43.257
Yeah, c...
can I ask you a question?

52
00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:47.804
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

53
00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:50.681
Yeah. Okay.
I'll leave my number.

54
00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:55.186
<i>It's 555-0199.</i>

55
00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:58.815
Lester Burnham.
Thank you!

56
00:05:00.274 --> 00:05:04.362
Hey, Les.
You got a minute?

57
00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:08.157
For you, Brad,
I got five!

58
00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:12.703
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.

59
00:05:12.787 --> 00:05:14.914
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.

60
00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:18.376
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.

61
00:05:18.459 --> 00:05:21.337
- <i>Right?</i>
- Exactly.

62
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.341
<i>Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used the
company MasterCard to pay for that hooker,</i>

63
00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:29.554
and she used the card numbers and stayed at
the St. Regis for, what was it, three months?

64
00:05:29.637 --> 00:05:33.683
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000. That's somebody's salary.

65
00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.853
That's somebody who's going to get fired
because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!

66
00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.938
<i>Jesus!</i>

67
00:05:39.021 --> 00:05:42.692
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.

68
00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:45.236
<i>That's why we're having everyone...</i>

69
00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.824
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.

70
00:05:49.907 --> 00:05:53.661
That way management
can assess who's valuable...

71
00:05:53.744 --> 00:05:56.456
And who's expendable.

72
00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.208
<i>It's just business.</i>

73
00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:02.545
I've been writing
for this magazine for 14 years.

74
00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:06.883
- You've been here how long? A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.

75
00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.802
I'm trying to level with you.

76
00:06:09.886 --> 00:06:13.389
This is your one chance
to save your job.

77
00:06:14.974 --> 00:06:17.685
<i>There is no decision.</i>
<i>You just write the damn thing.</i>

78
00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:20.772
- You don't think it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.

79
00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:22.815
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.

80
00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:25.610
Let's just all sell our souls and work for
Satan 'cause it's more convenient that way.

81
00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:28.738
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?

82
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.032
So, we finally
got new neighbors.

83
00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:35.703
<i>You know, if the Lomans had let me represent
them instead of the Real Estate King,</i>

84
00:06:35.787 --> 00:06:38.289
that house would never
have sat on the market for six months.

85
00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:41.125
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

86
00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:43.795
<i>Their</i> sycamore?
Come on.

87
00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:46.589
A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

88
00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:49.634
You know that.
How can you call it <i>their</i> sycamore?

89
00:06:49.717 --> 00:06:54.806
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something
if it wasn't partially mine, which, of course, it was.

90
00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:09.028
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?

91
00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:12.824
No. No, we don't.

92
00:07:12.907 --> 00:07:16.828
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,

93
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.872
you can listen
to whatever you like.

94
00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:26.796
So, Janie, how was school?

95
00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:29.257
It was okay.

96
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.759
Just okay?

97
00:07:31.843 --> 00:07:35.930
No, Dad.
It was spectacular.

98
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:41.811
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?

99
00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:44.313
They've hired
this efficiency expert,

100
00:07:44.397 --> 00:07:47.108
this really friendly guy
named Brad...

101
00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:51.612
How perfect is that? And he's basically
there to make it seem they're justified...

102
00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:55.158
in firing somebody, because they couldn't
just come out and say that, could they?

103
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.536
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us...

104
00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:02.123
You couldn't
possibly care less, could you?

105
00:08:02.206 --> 00:08:04.333
What do you expect?

106
00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:08.671
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

107
00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:14.510
I mean, hello, you've barely even
spoken to me for months.

108
00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:23.603
Oh, what?
You're "Mother of the Year"?

109
00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:27.148
You treat her like an employee.
- What?

110
00:08:29.066 --> 00:08:31.861
What?

111
00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:34.614
I'm going
to get some ice cream.

112
00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:45.249
Janie...

113
00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:51.380
I'm sorry I haven't
been more available.

114
00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:53.716
I'm just... I...

115
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.931
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.

116
00:09:00.014 --> 00:09:03.059
Oh, great.
So now it's my fault?

117
00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:06.562
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It...

118
00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:11.025
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.

119
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:53.961
I will sell this house today.

120
00:11:04.388 --> 00:11:09.352
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.

121
00:11:23.282 --> 00:11:26.285
I will sell this house today.

122
00:11:34.377 --> 00:11:37.171
Welcome.
I'm Carolyn Burnham.

123
00:11:37.255 --> 00:11:40.299
This living room
is very dramatic.

124
00:11:40.383 --> 00:11:43.261
<i>Wait till you see</i>
<i>the native stone fireplace!</i>

125
00:11:43.344 --> 00:11:48.850
A simple cream could really lighten things
up. You could even put in a skylight.

126
00:11:51.602 --> 00:11:53.729
Well, why don't we
go into the kitchen?

127
00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:57.191
It's a dream come true
for any cook.

128
00:11:57.275 --> 00:12:00.611
Just filled
with positive energy, huh?

129
00:12:00.695 --> 00:12:06.200
And you'll be surprised how much a ceiling
fan can cut down on your energy costs.

130
00:12:09.162 --> 00:12:13.791
<i>You know, you could have some fun</i>
<i>backyard get-togethers out here.</i>

131
00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:17.253
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

132
00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:21.799
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.

133
00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:24.802
What do you call this?
Is this not a plant?

134
00:12:24.886 --> 00:12:28.306
If you have a problem with the plants, I
can always call my landscape architect.

135
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:32.977
- Solved.
- I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, tropical.

136
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.022
This is a cement hole.

137
00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:39.066
Uh...

138
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.278
I have some tiki torches
in the garage.

139
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.563
Shut up! Stop it!
You weak... You baby!

140
00:13:17.647 --> 00:13:20.608
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

141
00:14:05.736 --> 00:14:07.864
Who are you looking for?

142
00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:10.575
My parents are coming tonight.

143
00:14:10.658 --> 00:14:14.328
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

144
00:14:14.412 --> 00:14:17.373
Gross. I hate it
when my mom does that.

145
00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:21.461
They're such assholes. Why can't
they just have their own lives?

146
00:14:24.422 --> 00:14:28.551
What makes you sure she wants us
to be there? Did she ask us to come?

147
00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:32.013
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.

148
00:14:32.096 --> 00:14:34.223
But she's been practicing
for weeks.

149
00:14:34.307 --> 00:14:38.603
I'll bet she's going to resent it, and I'm
missing the James Bond marathon on T.N.T.

150
00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:43.733
Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a
real distance growing between you and Jane.

151
00:14:43.816 --> 00:14:46.611
"Growing"?
She hates me.

152
00:14:46.694 --> 00:14:50.698
- She's just willful.
- She hates you too.

153
00:14:58.623 --> 00:15:01.709
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.

154
00:15:01.793 --> 00:15:04.253
Hi! Patty!

155
00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:07.298
<i>Now, for your halftime entertainment,</i>

156
00:15:07.381 --> 00:15:11.719
<i>Rockwell High's award-winning</i>
<i>Dancing Spartanettes!</i>

157
00:15:11.803 --> 00:15:14.430
We can leave
right after this, right?

158
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.566
Shit. They're still here.

159
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.735
Janie!

160
00:17:32.819 --> 00:17:35.029
Hey, I really enjoyed that.

161
00:17:35.113 --> 00:17:38.074
- Congratulations, honey. You were great.
- <i>I didn't win anything.</i>

162
00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:41.828
- Hi. I'm Lester, Janie's dad.
- Oh, hi.

163
00:17:44.455 --> 00:17:47.083
This is my friend,
Angela Hayes.

164
00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:50.545
Okay. Good to meet you.

165
00:17:50.628 --> 00:17:55.925
<i>You were also good tonight,</i>
<i>very... precise.</i>

166
00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:58.928
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you, Angela.

167
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:01.722
Honey...
I am so proud of you.

168
00:18:01.806 --> 00:18:05.601
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.

169
00:18:06.686 --> 00:18:09.856
Okay, uh, we have to go.

170
00:18:09.939 --> 00:18:12.483
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad.

171
00:18:12.567 --> 00:18:15.820
- We're going out for pizza.
- Really? Do you need a ride? We can give you a ride.

172
00:18:15.903 --> 00:18:19.615
- I have a car. You want to come with us?
- Thanks, but I have a car.

173
00:18:19.699 --> 00:18:23.494
You <i>have</i> a car.
That's great. That's great.

174
00:18:23.578 --> 00:18:26.456
Janie's thinking about
getting a car, too, soon, aren't you?

175
00:18:26.539 --> 00:18:29.876
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.

176
00:18:31.878 --> 00:18:34.464
Well, it was very nice
meeting you, Angela.

177
00:18:34.547 --> 00:18:37.008
<i>Any friend of Janie's...</i>

178
00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:41.596
<i>is a... friend of mine.</i>

179
00:18:44.766 --> 00:18:48.728
Well... I'll be
seeing you around, then.

180
00:18:52.565 --> 00:18:57.195
Could he be any more...
pathetic?

181
00:18:57.278 --> 00:19:00.239
I think he's sweet.

182
00:19:00.323 --> 00:19:05.536
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

183
00:19:22.011 --> 00:19:25.098
<i>It's the weirdest thing.</i>

184
00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:28.643
<i>I feel like I've been in a coma</i>
<i>for about 20 years...</i>

185
00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:31.896
<i>and I'm just now waking up.</i>

186
00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.638
<i>Spec-tacular.</i>

187
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.859
I'm so sorry
my dad was weird tonight.

188
00:20:19.819 --> 00:20:21.779
That's okay.

189
00:20:21.863 --> 00:20:24.198
I'm used to guys
drooling over me.

190
00:20:25.283 --> 00:20:27.743
It started
when I was about 12.

191
00:20:27.827 --> 00:20:30.913
I'd go to dinner
with my parents.

192
00:20:30.997 --> 00:20:34.125
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.

193
00:20:34.208 --> 00:20:37.170
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.

194
00:20:37.253 --> 00:20:39.422
And I knew
what they were thinking,

195
00:20:39.505 --> 00:20:43.426
just like I knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off.

196
00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:46.262
- Vomit.
- No. I liked it.

197
00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:50.933
I still like it. If people I don't even
know look at me and want to fuck me,

198
00:20:51.017 --> 00:20:55.188
it means I really have a shot
at being a model.

199
00:20:55.271 --> 00:20:57.565
Which is great,

200
00:20:57.648 --> 00:21:01.694
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.

201
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.409
I really think
it'll happen for you.

202
00:21:09.494 --> 00:21:11.412
I know.

203
00:21:11.496 --> 00:21:16.167
Because everything that was meant
to happen, does... eventually.

204
00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:43.319
Asshole.

205
00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:51.971
Hello? Hello?

206
00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:10.448
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?

207
00:23:10.531 --> 00:23:12.450
I didn't.

208
00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:15.077
Well, my phone just rang and
I answered it, and somebody hung up.

209
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:19.791
- And I star-69'ed, and I called you
back. - Well, I was in the shower.

210
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:25.797
Oh, gross!

211
00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:44.273
<i>Ricky! Breakfast!</i>

212
00:23:45.942 --> 00:23:48.361
Be right there.

213
00:23:56.577 --> 00:23:58.454
- Mom.
- Hello.

214
00:23:58.538 --> 00:24:01.874
I don't eat bacon, remember?

215
00:24:03.042 --> 00:24:06.003
I'm sorry.
I must've forgotten.

216
00:24:16.097 --> 00:24:19.058
What's new in the world, Dad?

217
00:24:19.142 --> 00:24:22.937
This country
is going straight to hell.

218
00:24:29.944 --> 00:24:32.822
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

219
00:24:35.825 --> 00:24:38.161
No.

220
00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:47.170
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

221
00:24:47.253 --> 00:24:49.464
- It's just a little something from our garden.
- Except for the pasta.

222
00:24:49.547 --> 00:24:52.175
- We got that at Fallaci's.
- Right. It's unbelievably fresh.

223
00:24:52.258 --> 00:24:55.845
You just... You drop it
in the water, and it's done.

224
00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:59.766
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

225
00:24:59.849 --> 00:25:02.185
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

226
00:25:02.268 --> 00:25:05.897
- It's nice to meet you. This is my partner...
- Jim Berkley, but call me J.B.

227
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.275
Let's cut to chase, okay?
What are you guys selling?

228
00:25:09.358 --> 00:25:13.446
- We...
- Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors.

229
00:25:13.529 --> 00:25:19.076
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're
partners, so what's your business?

230
00:25:20.703 --> 00:25:24.707
Well... he is a tax attorney.

231
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:27.794
And he's an anesthesiologist.

232
00:25:36.469 --> 00:25:40.932
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face?

233
00:25:41.015 --> 00:25:44.102
How can they
be so shameless?

234
00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:48.773
That's the whole thing, Dad.

235
00:25:48.856 --> 00:25:52.151
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

236
00:25:53.277 --> 00:25:55.780
Well, it is.

237
00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.828
- Yeah, you're right.
- Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.

238
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:07.625
Forgive me, sir,
for speaking so bluntly,

239
00:26:07.708 --> 00:26:10.753
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.

240
00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:23.683
Well, me too, son.
Yeah. Me too.

241
00:26:28.729 --> 00:26:32.692
<i>I'm serious. He just</i>
<i>pulled down his pants and yanked it out.</i>

242
00:26:32.775 --> 00:26:36.446
- <i>You know, like, "Say hello to Mr. Happy."</i>
- Gross!

243
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:41.367
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?

244
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:45.788
<i>Of course. He's a really</i>
<i>well-known photographer.</i>

245
00:26:45.872 --> 00:26:48.624
He shoots for <i>Elle</i> on,
like, a regular basis.

246
00:26:48.708 --> 00:26:53.463
- It would've been majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
- You are a total prostitute.

247
00:26:53.546 --> 00:26:57.675
Hey, that's how
things really are.

248
00:26:57.759 --> 00:27:01.596
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.

249
00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:05.266
<i>So are you. You've only been</i>
<i>in</i> Seventeen <i>once, and you looked fat.</i>

250
00:27:05.349 --> 00:27:09.020
So stop acting like you're
goddamn Christy Turlington!

251
00:27:11.355 --> 00:27:13.274
Cunt!

252
00:27:14.734 --> 00:27:18.237
I am so sick of people
taking their insecurities out on me.

253
00:27:19.947 --> 00:27:24.243
- <i>Oh, my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.</i>
- Him?

254
00:27:24.327 --> 00:27:27.371
<i>Jane. No way.</i>
<i>He's a total lunatic.</i>

255
00:27:27.455 --> 00:27:29.373
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

256
00:27:29.457 --> 00:27:31.667
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,

257
00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:35.296
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.

258
00:27:35.379 --> 00:27:39.759
And then one day,
he was just, like, gone.

259
00:27:39.842 --> 00:27:45.681
And then Connie Cardullo told me that his
parents had to put him in a mental institution.

260
00:27:45.765 --> 00:27:47.892
Why? What did he do?

261
00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:50.853
What do you mean?

262
00:27:50.937 --> 00:27:55.066
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

263
00:27:57.485 --> 00:28:02.615
You total slut.
You've got a crush on him.

264
00:28:02.698 --> 00:28:05.493
- What? Please!
- You are defending him. You love him.

265
00:28:05.576 --> 00:28:08.871
- You want to have, like, 10,000 of his babies.
- Shut up.

266
00:28:08.955 --> 00:28:13.209
<i>Hi. My name's Ricky.</i>
<i>I just moved next door to you.</i>

267
00:28:13.292 --> 00:28:15.336
I know.

268
00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:19.549
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night?

269
00:28:19.632 --> 00:28:23.719
- I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

270
00:28:23.803 --> 00:28:28.433
But I really don't need to have some
psycho obsessing about me right now.

271
00:28:29.475 --> 00:28:33.479
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just curious.

272
00:28:48.619 --> 00:28:50.580
What a freak.

273
00:28:50.663 --> 00:28:53.958
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?

274
00:28:54.041 --> 00:28:57.170
He's, like, so confident.

275
00:28:57.253 --> 00:29:00.298
<i>That can't be real.</i>

276
00:29:00.381 --> 00:29:02.925
I don't believe him.

277
00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:07.096
I mean, he didn't even,
like, look at me once.

278
00:29:12.226 --> 00:29:16.314
- <i>How'd you get in the Army?</i>
- <i>Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.</i>

279
00:29:16.397 --> 00:29:20.443
First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love
my country. And third, they nailed me.

280
00:29:34.874 --> 00:29:36.793
Hey.

281
00:29:39.879 --> 00:29:43.549
- What's going on here?
- Bend all the way down. Here comes the Bull of the Woods.

282
00:29:46.469 --> 00:29:49.055
I'm sorry. What?

283
00:29:50.139 --> 00:29:52.517
Mom, nobody said anything.

284
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.061
Oh. I'm sorry.

285
00:30:01.567 --> 00:30:03.611
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.

286
00:30:03.694 --> 00:30:06.739
- How would it look if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.

287
00:30:06.823 --> 00:30:10.326
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.

288
00:30:10.409 --> 00:30:13.579
As you know, my business
is selling an image,

289
00:30:13.663 --> 00:30:15.998
and part of my job
is to live that image.

290
00:30:16.082 --> 00:30:20.545
Honey, do me a favor and say whatever you
want to say and spare me the propaganda.

291
00:30:20.628 --> 00:30:23.548
All right.
Hi, Shirley!

292
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:27.969
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

293
00:30:28.052 --> 00:30:32.849
- I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!

294
00:30:32.932 --> 00:30:36.394
- <i>Buddy! Buddy! Hi!</i>
- Hi.

295
00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:38.938
Good to see you again.

296
00:30:39.021 --> 00:30:42.525
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.

297
00:30:42.608 --> 00:30:45.570
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?

298
00:30:45.653 --> 00:30:49.615
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

299
00:30:50.783 --> 00:30:53.661
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

300
00:30:53.744 --> 00:30:58.875
Oh, we've met before, actually. This
thing last year. Christmas at the Sheraton.

301
00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:01.210
Oh, yeah!

302
00:31:01.294 --> 00:31:04.422
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.

303
00:31:08.468 --> 00:31:10.970
Honey, don't be weird.

304
00:31:11.053 --> 00:31:13.890
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.

305
00:31:13.973 --> 00:31:17.226
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.

306
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.812
Well, oka...

307
00:31:29.655 --> 00:31:33.743
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.

308
00:31:37.163 --> 00:31:40.291
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

309
00:31:40.374 --> 00:31:43.085
Ohh.

310
00:31:45.588 --> 00:31:48.674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

311
00:32:04.524 --> 00:32:09.821
<i>Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood</i>
<i>Trail? The house with the red door?</i>

312
00:32:09.904 --> 00:32:14.826
- Yeah.
- I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved in the house next to you.

313
00:32:14.909 --> 00:32:19.163
Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.

314
00:32:19.247 --> 00:32:21.791
Hi, Lester Burnham.

315
00:32:31.884 --> 00:32:35.304
- Do you party?
- Excuse me?

316
00:32:35.388 --> 00:32:38.599
Do you get high?

317
00:32:41.144 --> 00:32:45.898
You know, I probably wouldn't even tell
you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but...

318
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.236
I'm in complete awe of you.

319
00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:52.738
I mean, your firm...

320
00:32:52.822 --> 00:32:56.826
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,

321
00:32:56.909 --> 00:33:00.413
and your personal
sales record is...

322
00:33:00.496 --> 00:33:04.542
It's very intimidating.

323
00:33:04.625 --> 00:33:09.630
You know, I'd love to sit down
with you and just pick your brain,

324
00:33:09.714 --> 00:33:12.592
if you'd ever be willing.

325
00:33:14.177 --> 00:33:17.680
You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,

326
00:33:17.764 --> 00:33:21.476
but I mean, hey,
I don't flatter myself...

327
00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:25.062
that I'm even
in the same league as you.

328
00:33:25.146 --> 00:33:27.356
I don't.

329
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.400
I'd love to.

330
00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:33.905
- Really?
- Absolutely.

331
00:33:33.988 --> 00:33:37.283
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

332
00:33:38.826 --> 00:33:41.621
I'll do that.
Thank you.

333
00:33:47.794 --> 00:33:51.297
Did you ever see that movie
where the body is walking around...

334
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.592
carrying its own head, and then
the head goes down on that babe?

335
00:33:54.675 --> 00:33:57.553
<i>Re-Animator.</i>

336
00:33:59.806 --> 00:34:01.766
Look.

337
00:34:01.849 --> 00:34:05.228
I'm not paying you to do whatever
it is you're doing out here.

338
00:34:05.311 --> 00:34:08.231
Fine. So don't pay me.

339
00:34:08.314 --> 00:34:10.399
Excuse me?

340
00:34:10.483 --> 00:34:15.404
I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now leave me alone.

341
00:34:17.657 --> 00:34:19.909
Asshole.

342
00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:27.750
I think you just
became my personal hero.

343
00:34:27.834 --> 00:34:31.295
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?

344
00:34:33.005 --> 00:34:36.217
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what, 16...

345
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.763
Eighteen. I just do
these gigs as a cover.

346
00:34:40.847 --> 00:34:43.933
I have other sources of income.

347
00:34:44.016 --> 00:34:46.644
But my dad interferes less
in my life when I pretend...

348
00:34:46.727 --> 00:34:50.064
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.

349
00:34:50.148 --> 00:34:52.233
Lester?

350
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:59.282
- What are you doing?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.

351
00:34:59.365 --> 00:35:03.202
This is Ricky Fitts.

352
00:35:05.621 --> 00:35:08.624
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.

353
00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:11.711
I go to school
with your daughter.

354
00:35:11.794 --> 00:35:14.422
- With Jane?
- Yeah.

355
00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:17.216
- Really?
- Jane.

356
00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.888
Hi. I'm ready to go.
I'll meet you out front.

357
00:35:25.933 --> 00:35:29.896
Oh, I'm in trouble.

358
00:35:31.272 --> 00:35:34.358
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.

359
00:35:34.442 --> 00:35:37.320
Anytime. Lester?

360
00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:40.990
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

361
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.800
Oh, shit. They're home. Quick.
Let's go up to my room.

362
00:35:58.883 --> 00:36:01.344
I should say hi
to your dad.

363
00:36:01.427 --> 00:36:04.555
I don't want to be rude.

364
00:36:16.275 --> 00:36:18.486
Nice suit.

365
00:36:19.612 --> 00:36:21.614
You're looking good,
Mr. Burnham.

366
00:36:21.697 --> 00:36:25.451
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

367
00:36:29.163 --> 00:36:31.457
Ooh, is that root beer?

368
00:37:31.017 --> 00:37:33.102
I love root beer,
don't you?

369
00:37:35.563 --> 00:37:37.482
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

370
00:37:37.565 --> 00:37:39.776
- Hi.
- Remember Angela?

371
00:37:39.859 --> 00:37:41.944
Yes, of course.

372
00:37:42.028 --> 00:37:45.782
I forgot to tell you. She's going
to spend the night. Is that okay?

373
00:37:53.706 --> 00:37:57.293
- <i>Sorry about my dad.</i>
- <i>Don't be. I think it's funny.</i>

374
00:37:57.376 --> 00:38:02.423
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

375
00:38:02.507 --> 00:38:07.345
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.

376
00:38:08.805 --> 00:38:12.558
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.

377
00:38:12.642 --> 00:38:15.895
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- <i>Shut up.</i>

378
00:38:15.978 --> 00:38:19.732
<i>He is. If he just</i>
<i>worked out a little, he'd be hot.</i>

379
00:38:19.816 --> 00:38:21.776
- Shut up!
- Come on.

380
00:38:21.859 --> 00:38:26.739
Like you've never sneaked a peek at him in
his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick.

381
00:38:26.823 --> 00:38:29.158
<i>You are so grossing me out right now.</i>

382
00:38:29.242 --> 00:38:32.495
<i>If he built up his chest</i>
<i>and arms, I would totally fuck him.</i>

383
00:38:32.578 --> 00:38:36.833
I would. I would suck
your dad's big fat dick,

384
00:38:36.916 --> 00:38:40.002
and then I'd fuck him until
his eyes rolled back in his head.

385
00:38:40.086 --> 00:38:43.756
Jane, shh. What was that noise?

386
00:38:46.426 --> 00:38:49.095
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.

387
00:38:49.178 --> 00:38:52.140
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.

388
00:38:52.223 --> 00:38:54.684
No, I'm serious.

389
00:38:54.767 --> 00:38:57.520
See?

390
00:38:57.603 --> 00:39:00.898
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- <i>What is it?</i>

391
00:39:03.985 --> 00:39:07.405
<i>It's that psycho next door.</i>

392
00:39:07.488 --> 00:39:09.657
Jane, what if he worships you?

393
00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.871
What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you
surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?

394
00:39:14.954 --> 00:39:18.416
Shit. I bet
he's filming us right now.

395
00:39:18.499 --> 00:39:20.460
Really?

396
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.971
Welcome to
<i>America's Weirdest Home Videos.</i>

397
00:41:19.412 --> 00:41:22.623
<i>Ricky?</i>

398
00:41:22.707 --> 00:41:25.042
Coming, Dad.

399
00:41:25.126 --> 00:41:28.671
<i>You know I don't like</i>
<i>locked doors in my house, boy.</i>

400
00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.847
- I'm sorry. I must've locked it by accident.
- Mm.

401
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:41.559
So what's up?

402
00:41:43.644 --> 00:41:46.397
I... I need a urine sample.

403
00:41:46.481 --> 00:41:48.399
Wow.

404
00:41:48.483 --> 00:41:51.194
It's been six months already.

405
00:41:51.277 --> 00:41:54.363
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.

406
00:41:54.447 --> 00:41:56.574
Yeah. I suppose.

407
00:42:00.495 --> 00:42:03.289
Y-You know...

408
00:42:10.797 --> 00:42:14.634
Well, good night, son.

409
00:43:20.908 --> 00:43:22.994
I've been waiting for you.

410
00:43:43.765 --> 00:43:46.309
You've been working out,
haven't you?

411
00:43:46.392 --> 00:43:48.561
I can tell.

412
00:43:50.062 --> 00:43:53.149
I was hoping you could
give me a bath.

413
00:43:53.232 --> 00:43:55.777
I'm very, very dirty.

414
00:44:28.726 --> 00:44:30.978
What are you doing?

415
00:44:32.313 --> 00:44:34.357
Nothing.

416
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.026
- You were masturbating.
- I was not.

417
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.904
Yes, you were.

418
00:44:39.987 --> 00:44:43.741
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.

419
00:44:43.825 --> 00:44:47.411
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.

420
00:44:47.495 --> 00:44:50.414
You know, saying "hi"
to my monster.

421
00:44:50.498 --> 00:44:52.417
That's disgusting.

422
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.628
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins.

423
00:44:55.711 --> 00:44:57.964
- So do I.
- Really?

424
00:44:58.047 --> 00:45:02.385
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.

425
00:45:02.468 --> 00:45:06.055
Lester, I refuse to live like this!

426
00:45:06.139 --> 00:45:08.099
This is not a marriage.

427
00:45:08.182 --> 00:45:11.269
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,

428
00:45:11.352 --> 00:45:14.313
but you were happy as long
as I kept my mouth shut.

429
00:45:14.397 --> 00:45:16.441
Well, guess what.
I've changed.

430
00:45:16.524 --> 00:45:19.110
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...

431
00:45:19.193 --> 00:45:21.988
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.

432
00:45:22.071 --> 00:45:24.740
I see. You think you're the
only one who's sexually frustrated.

433
00:45:24.824 --> 00:45:27.952
I'm not? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.

434
00:45:28.035 --> 00:45:30.204
Don't you mess
with me, mister.

435
00:45:30.288 --> 00:45:33.416
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.

436
00:45:33.499 --> 00:45:35.668
On what grounds?

437
00:45:35.752 --> 00:45:38.337
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

438
00:45:38.421 --> 00:45:40.840
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

439
00:45:40.923 --> 00:45:43.509
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...

440
00:45:43.593 --> 00:45:45.887
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!

441
00:45:47.889 --> 00:45:51.309
<i>But... I did support you</i>
<i>when you got your license.</i>

442
00:45:51.392 --> 00:45:55.480
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

443
00:45:55.563 --> 00:45:58.399
Oh!

444
00:45:58.483 --> 00:46:02.236
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay?

445
00:46:13.706 --> 00:46:16.626
<i>It's a great thing</i>
<i>when you realize you still have...</i>

446
00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:19.295
<i>the ability</i>
<i>to surprise yourself.</i>

447
00:46:19.378 --> 00:46:23.341
<i>Makes you wonder what else you can do</i>
<i>that you've forgotten about.</i>

448
00:46:23.424 --> 00:46:25.384
Hey, guys.

449
00:46:25.468 --> 00:46:27.887
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

450
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:30.306
- I just started.
- Good for you.

451
00:46:30.389 --> 00:46:34.477
I figured you guys might be able to give
me some pointers. I need to shape up, fast.

452
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.355
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...

453
00:46:37.438 --> 00:46:40.358
increased strength
and flexibility as well?

454
00:46:40.441 --> 00:46:43.903
I... I want
to look good naked.

455
00:46:58.793 --> 00:47:03.506
<i>Oh, what is this?</i>
<i>Fuckin' gay pride parade?</i>

456
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:05.675
Hey! Yo, Ricky.

457
00:47:09.095 --> 00:47:13.850
My entire life is passing before my eyes,
and those two have barely broken a sweat.

458
00:47:13.933 --> 00:47:17.186
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

459
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.272
Colonel Frank Fitts,
U.S. Marine Corps.

460
00:47:19.355 --> 00:47:22.442
Oh, whoa. Well.

461
00:47:22.525 --> 00:47:24.777
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

462
00:47:28.739 --> 00:47:31.701
Ricky, uh...

463
00:47:31.784 --> 00:47:35.371
I was thinking about the, uh...
I was gonna... The movie we talked about.

464
00:47:35.455 --> 00:47:37.373
- <i>Re-Animator.</i>
- Yeah!

465
00:47:37.457 --> 00:47:41.210
You want to borrow it?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.

466
00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:54.807
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.

467
00:47:54.891 --> 00:47:58.978
I don't think my dad would try to come in
while someone else is here, but you never know.

468
00:47:59.061 --> 00:48:02.106
- What is this?
- Urine.

469
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:06.569
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

470
00:48:06.652 --> 00:48:09.572
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.

471
00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:11.741
It's not mine.

472
00:48:11.824 --> 00:48:15.578
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

473
00:48:15.661 --> 00:48:19.248
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

474
00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:23.336
You like Pink Floyd?

475
00:48:24.879 --> 00:48:27.340
I like a lot of music.

476
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:32.929
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

477
00:48:33.012 --> 00:48:35.431
How much do you want?

478
00:48:35.515 --> 00:48:39.435
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?

479
00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:46.025
This is totally decent,
and it's 300.

480
00:48:47.276 --> 00:48:49.278
Wow!

481
00:48:49.362 --> 00:48:51.948
This shit is
top of the line.

482
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:55.660
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.

483
00:48:55.743 --> 00:48:59.539
It's extremely potent, but
a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

484
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:03.501
Is that what we smoked
last night?

485
00:49:03.584 --> 00:49:06.212
This is all I ever smoke.

486
00:49:10.049 --> 00:49:13.553
- How much?
- Two grand.

487
00:49:13.636 --> 00:49:15.888
Jesus!

488
00:49:15.972 --> 00:49:18.808
Things have changed since 1973.

489
00:49:18.891 --> 00:49:22.645
- You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.

490
00:49:22.728 --> 00:49:25.064
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

491
00:49:25.148 --> 00:49:28.484
<i>Beep me anytime, day or night.</i>

492
00:49:28.568 --> 00:49:30.778
And I only accept cash.

493
00:49:30.862 --> 00:49:34.657
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

494
00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:39.662
God. When I was your age, I flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an eight-track.

495
00:49:39.745 --> 00:49:43.791
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.

496
00:49:45.418 --> 00:49:48.379
All I did was party
and get laid.

497
00:49:50.006 --> 00:49:53.092
I had my whole life
ahead of me.

498
00:49:54.969 --> 00:49:59.307
My dad thinks I pay for all
this with catering jobs.

499
00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.351
Never underestimate
the power of denial.

500
00:50:35.426 --> 00:50:39.514
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

501
00:50:39.597 --> 00:50:42.433
Uh-oh. Mom's mad.

502
00:50:42.517 --> 00:50:44.560
Bench presses.

503
00:50:44.644 --> 00:50:49.273
I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.

504
00:50:49.357 --> 00:50:53.236
I see you're smoking pot now.
I... I'm so glad.

505
00:50:53.319 --> 00:50:55.780
I think using illegal
psychotropic substances...

506
00:50:55.863 --> 00:50:58.366
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

507
00:50:58.449 --> 00:51:02.703
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

508
00:51:03.913 --> 00:51:05.915
Uh... Lester!

509
00:51:05.998 --> 00:51:08.042
You have such hostility in you.

510
00:51:08.126 --> 00:51:12.380
Do you mind? I'm trying to work
out here. Unless... you want to spot me.

511
00:51:12.463 --> 00:51:16.050
Lester, you will not
get away with this.

512
00:51:16.134 --> 00:51:19.262
You can be sure of that.

513
00:51:19.345 --> 00:51:22.932
That's... what...

514
00:51:23.015 --> 00:51:25.101
you... think.

515
00:51:25.351 --> 00:51:28.813
"My job consists of
basically masking...

516
00:51:28.896 --> 00:51:32.608
"my contempt for
the assholes in charge...

517
00:51:32.692 --> 00:51:36.320
"and at least once a day
retiring to the men's room...

518
00:51:36.404 --> 00:51:38.573
"so I can jerk off...

519
00:51:38.656 --> 00:51:41.284
"while I fantasize
about a life...

520
00:51:41.367 --> 00:51:44.787
that doesn't so closely
resemble hell."

521
00:51:44.871 --> 00:51:48.583
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.

522
00:51:48.666 --> 00:51:52.837
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

523
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.632
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

524
00:51:56.716 --> 00:52:00.428
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.

525
00:52:00.511 --> 00:52:03.639
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,

526
00:52:03.723 --> 00:52:06.267
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...

527
00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.269
buying pussy
with company money?

528
00:52:08.352 --> 00:52:11.063
<i>Which I think</i>
<i>would interest the I.R.S.,</i>

529
00:52:11.147 --> 00:52:13.191
since it technically
constitutes fraud.

530
00:52:13.274 --> 00:52:16.194
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rival publications...

531
00:52:16.277 --> 00:52:20.573
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

532
00:52:22.658 --> 00:52:26.871
- What do you want?
- One year's salary <i>with</i> benefits.

533
00:52:26.954 --> 00:52:30.124
That's not going to happen.

534
00:52:30.208 --> 00:52:33.544
What do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?

535
00:52:33.628 --> 00:52:37.381
Against who?

536
00:52:37.465 --> 00:52:39.300
Against you.

537
00:52:39.383 --> 00:52:42.887
<i>Can you prove that you</i>
<i>didn't offer to save my job...</i>

538
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.515
if I let you blow me?

539
00:52:50.603 --> 00:52:54.023
Man... you are
one twisted fuck.

540
00:52:55.441 --> 00:52:58.653
Nope. I'm just
an ordinary guy...

541
00:52:58.736 --> 00:53:01.447
with nothing to lose.

542
00:53:06.410 --> 00:53:08.371
Yeah.

543
00:53:13.876 --> 00:53:16.504
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

544
00:53:16.587 --> 00:53:20.800
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh.

545
00:53:20.883 --> 00:53:23.261
Christy left for New York
this morning.

546
00:53:23.344 --> 00:53:26.806
Let's just say things were
a little... hectic around the house.

547
00:53:26.889 --> 00:53:30.393
- What's she doing in New York?
- She's moving there.

548
00:53:30.476 --> 00:53:32.478
Yes, we are splitting up.

549
00:53:32.562 --> 00:53:35.148
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

550
00:53:35.231 --> 00:53:38.901
Yes. According to her, I'm...

551
00:53:38.985 --> 00:53:40.987
too focused on my career.

552
00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:44.073
As if being driven to succeed is...

553
00:53:44.157 --> 00:53:47.869
some sort of a character flaw.

554
00:53:47.952 --> 00:53:51.914
Well, she certainly did take advantage
of the lifestyle my success afforded her.

555
00:53:51.998 --> 00:53:54.500
Ooh! Ha. Wow.

556
00:53:56.335 --> 00:53:59.505
- Ah, it's for the best.
- Mm-hmm.

557
00:53:59.589 --> 00:54:04.093
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

558
00:54:04.177 --> 00:54:06.846
Well, call me crazy,

559
00:54:06.929 --> 00:54:11.434
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

560
00:54:11.517 --> 00:54:14.270
one <i>must</i> project
an image of success...

561
00:54:14.353 --> 00:54:16.439
<i>at all times.</i>

562
00:54:35.917 --> 00:54:38.920
<i>What are you doing?</i>

563
00:54:39.003 --> 00:54:42.632
- <i>I was filming this dead bird.</i>
- Why?

564
00:54:42.715 --> 00:54:44.926
<i>Because it's beautiful.</i>

565
00:54:47.428 --> 00:54:51.099
I think maybe you forgot
your medication today, mental boy.

566
00:54:53.059 --> 00:54:55.019
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>

567
00:54:55.103 --> 00:54:57.522
I want you to stop filming me.

568
00:54:59.524 --> 00:55:01.442
Okay.

569
00:55:01.526 --> 00:55:04.070
Well, whatever. This is boring.

570
00:55:04.153 --> 00:55:06.864
Let's go.

571
00:55:06.948 --> 00:55:10.326
- Do you need a ride?
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>

572
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:13.705
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a Dumpster somewhere.

573
00:55:13.788 --> 00:55:17.250
It's okay. I'll walk.
But thanks.

574
00:55:17.333 --> 00:55:19.711
He doesn't want to go anyway.
Let's go.

575
00:55:21.045 --> 00:55:24.716
- <i>Come on, Jane.</i>
- I think I'm going to walk too.

576
00:55:24.799 --> 00:55:26.926
<i>What?</i>

577
00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:30.930
Jane, that's, like,
almost a mile.

578
00:55:43.318 --> 00:55:46.988
<i>Oh, God!</i>

579
00:55:47.071 --> 00:55:49.490
I love it! Oh! Oh!

580
00:55:49.574 --> 00:55:52.827
- You like getting nailed by the King?
- Oh, yes, I love it!

581
00:55:52.911 --> 00:55:55.705
- Fuck me, Your Majesty! Aah!
- Ohh!

582
00:55:55.788 --> 00:55:57.832
- Who's the King?
- Oh! You are!

583
00:56:41.334 --> 00:56:43.670
<i>Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.</i>

584
00:56:43.753 --> 00:56:45.672
What?

585
00:56:45.755 --> 00:56:50.009
Would you like to try our new bacon and egg
fajita for $1.29 for a limited time only?

586
00:56:50.093 --> 00:56:53.012
Uh, no, but thank you.

587
00:56:53.096 --> 00:56:57.100
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries and an orange soda.

588
00:56:57.183 --> 00:56:59.644
Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.

589
00:57:01.521 --> 00:57:05.149
Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be 4.98, please.

590
00:57:07.485 --> 00:57:09.737
- Would you like some Smiley sauce?
- <i>No, no...</i>

591
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:12.490
<i>Actually, I'd like</i>
<i>to fill out an application.</i>

592
00:57:12.574 --> 00:57:16.536
- There's no jobs for manager. It's just for counter.
- Good.

593
00:57:16.619 --> 00:57:21.666
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.

594
00:57:23.793 --> 00:57:26.087
I don't think
you'd fit in here.

595
00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:29.299
I have fast food experience.

596
00:57:29.382 --> 00:57:31.676
Yeah, like 20 years ago.

597
00:57:31.759 --> 00:57:35.638
I'm sure there've been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

598
00:57:35.722 --> 00:57:38.308
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

599
00:57:38.391 --> 00:57:41.185
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

600
00:57:45.565 --> 00:57:48.860
- That was exactly what I needed...
- Mm.

601
00:57:51.821 --> 00:57:54.866
the "royal treatment,"
so to speak.

602
00:57:57.243 --> 00:58:00.496
I was so stressed out. Ah!

603
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.249
- Ah! Ah.
- Mm.

604
00:58:06.544 --> 00:58:09.297
Know what I do
when I feel like that?

605
00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.674
What?

606
00:58:11.758 --> 00:58:14.677
- I fire a gun.
- Really?

607
00:58:14.761 --> 00:58:17.639
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,

608
00:58:17.722 --> 00:58:22.060
and I... just pop off
a few rounds.

609
00:58:22.143 --> 00:58:26.064
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.

610
00:58:26.147 --> 00:58:29.067
Nothing makes you feel
more powerful.

611
00:58:31.152 --> 00:58:33.488
Well...

612
00:58:33.571 --> 00:58:35.740
almost nothing.

613
00:58:40.119 --> 00:58:43.623
- So, do you like your new house?
- I like it.

614
00:58:43.706 --> 00:58:47.210
The people who used to live there fed these
stray cats, so they were always around,

615
00:58:47.293 --> 00:58:49.963
and it drove
my mother nuts.

616
00:58:50.046 --> 00:58:54.008
And then she cut down
their tree.

617
00:58:54.092 --> 00:58:56.177
Is that a funeral?

618
00:58:56.261 --> 00:59:00.556
Yeah. Have you ever
known anybody who died?

619
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:03.559
No. Have you?

620
00:59:03.643 --> 00:59:05.728
No.

621
00:59:05.812 --> 00:59:08.648
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...

622
00:59:08.731 --> 00:59:11.150
just laying there
on the sidewalk.

623
00:59:11.234 --> 00:59:13.486
She looked really sad.

624
00:59:26.499 --> 00:59:29.586
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

625
00:59:29.669 --> 00:59:31.754
Why would you film that?

626
00:59:31.838 --> 00:59:35.592
- Because it was amazing.
- What's amazing about it?

627
00:59:35.675 --> 00:59:39.804
When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,

628
00:59:39.887 --> 00:59:41.889
just for a second,

629
00:59:41.973 --> 00:59:44.809
and if you're careful,
you can look right back.

630
00:59:44.892 --> 00:59:47.729
And what do you see?

631
00:59:47.812 --> 00:59:49.814
Beauty.

632
01:00:05.663 --> 01:00:08.791
Mom, I want you
to meet somebody.

633
01:00:12.629 --> 01:00:15.548
- Mom.
- Yes?

634
01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.930
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.

635
01:00:22.013 --> 01:00:24.307
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Oh, my.

636
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:27.894
I apologize for the way
things look around here.

637
01:00:37.904 --> 01:00:40.448
<i>This is where my dad hides out.</i>

638
01:00:40.531 --> 01:00:42.992
<i>I take it he's got a thing for guns.</i>

639
01:00:44.535 --> 01:00:48.498
You gotta see
this one thing.

640
01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:52.001
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.

641
01:00:52.085 --> 01:00:54.087
Did you steal his keys?

642
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:57.090
No. One of my clients
is a locksmith.

643
01:00:57.173 --> 01:01:01.135
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

644
01:01:14.357 --> 01:01:16.526
Turn it over.

645
01:01:19.779 --> 01:01:22.448
Oh, my God.

646
01:01:22.532 --> 01:01:24.951
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.

647
01:01:25.034 --> 01:01:28.955
There's a whole subculture
of people who collect this Nazi shit.

648
01:01:29.038 --> 01:01:31.541
But my dad just has
this one thing.

649
01:01:43.678 --> 01:01:46.973
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

650
01:01:47.056 --> 01:01:50.059
No, you're scared of me.

651
01:01:51.144 --> 01:01:53.313
No, I'm not.

652
01:01:53.396 --> 01:01:57.900
<i>You want to see the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I've ever filmed?</i>

653
01:02:20.632 --> 01:02:23.051
It was one of those days...

654
01:02:23.134 --> 01:02:26.095
where it's a minute
away from snowing,

655
01:02:28.306 --> 01:02:31.267
and there was this electricity
in the air.

656
01:02:33.728 --> 01:02:36.314
You can almost hear it.

657
01:02:36.397 --> 01:02:38.483
Right?

658
01:02:42.237 --> 01:02:46.074
And this bag was just...

659
01:02:46.157 --> 01:02:48.952
dancing with me,

660
01:02:50.954 --> 01:02:55.833
like a little kid
begging me to play with it,

661
01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:58.503
for 15 minutes.

662
01:03:01.965 --> 01:03:06.052
That's the day I realized
that there was this...

663
01:03:06.135 --> 01:03:10.056
entire life behind things...

664
01:03:13.184 --> 01:03:17.272
<i>and this incredibly</i>
<i>benevolent force...</i>

665
01:03:17.355 --> 01:03:21.651
<i>that wanted me to know that there</i>
<i>was no reason to be afraid...</i>

666
01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:25.446
<i>ever.</i>

667
01:03:27.657 --> 01:03:30.285
<i>Video's a poor excuse, I know,</i>

668
01:03:33.037 --> 01:03:35.540
<i>but it helps me remember.</i>

669
01:03:39.252 --> 01:03:41.671
<i>I need to remember.</i>

670
01:03:48.553 --> 01:03:51.806
Sometimes there's so much...

671
01:03:51.889 --> 01:03:54.767
beauty...

672
01:03:54.851 --> 01:03:57.270
in the world.

673
01:03:58.688 --> 01:04:02.150
I feel like
I can't take it...

674
01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.156
and my heart...

675
01:04:08.239 --> 01:04:10.783
is just going to...

676
01:04:10.867 --> 01:04:13.202
cave in.

677
01:04:59.707 --> 01:05:03.294
Oh, my God.
What time is it?

678
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:12.887
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, that's quite all right, dear.

679
01:05:12.971 --> 01:05:15.848
Your father and I were
just discussing his day at work.

680
01:05:15.932 --> 01:05:18.351
Why don't you tell
our daughter about it, honey?

681
01:05:18.434 --> 01:05:21.479
Janie, today I quit my job.

682
01:05:21.562 --> 01:05:24.482
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself, and
then I blackmailed him for almost $60,000.

683
01:05:24.565 --> 01:05:26.401
- Pass the asparagus.
- <i>Your father seems to think...</i>

684
01:05:26.484 --> 01:05:28.945
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of.

685
01:05:29.028 --> 01:05:31.781
And your mother seems to prefer that I
go through life like a fucking prisoner...

686
01:05:31.864 --> 01:05:34.117
while she keeps my dick
in a Mason jar under the sink.

687
01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.786
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her?

688
01:05:36.869 --> 01:05:39.455
And I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me...

689
01:05:39.539 --> 01:05:42.041
on the same day
that you lose your job!

690
01:05:42.125 --> 01:05:44.294
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Whoops, where did my job go?"

691
01:05:44.377 --> 01:05:46.296
I quit!
Pass the asparagus.

692
01:05:46.379 --> 01:05:49.632
<i>Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank you for</i>
<i>putting me under the added pressure...</i>

693
01:05:49.716 --> 01:05:51.759
of being the sole
breadwinner now.

694
01:05:51.843 --> 01:05:53.761
- I already have a job.
- <i>No, no!</i>

695
01:05:53.845 --> 01:05:56.431
<i>Don't give a second thought</i>
<i>as to who's going to pay the mortgage.</i>

696
01:05:56.514 --> 01:05:58.766
We'll leave it up to Carolyn. "You're going
to take care of everything now, Carolyn?"

697
01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:00.602
"Yes. I don't mind."

698
01:06:00.685 --> 01:06:03.313
<i>"Everything? You don't mind having</i>
<i>the sole responsibility?</i>

699
01:06:03.396 --> 01:06:05.982
Your husband feels he can just
quit his job, and you don't..."

700
01:06:06.065 --> 01:06:08.276
Will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus?

701
01:06:08.359 --> 01:06:10.945
- I'm not going to be a part of this.
- Sit down!

702
01:06:31.341 --> 01:06:34.677
I am sick and tired of being treated
like I don't exist.

703
01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:38.848
You two do whatever you want to do whenever
you want to do it, and I don't complain.

704
01:06:38.932 --> 01:06:42.185
- All I want...
- Oh, you don't complain? Oh, please! Excuse me!

705
01:06:42.268 --> 01:06:45.188
I must be psychotic then!
If you don't complain, what is this?

706
01:06:45.271 --> 01:06:49.651
<i>Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter</i>
<i>and see how loud it gets on that one.</i>

707
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:02.664
Don't interrupt me, honey.

708
01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:18.638
And another thing.

709
01:07:18.721 --> 01:07:21.307
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music,

710
01:07:21.391 --> 01:07:23.977
because, frankly...
and I don't think I'm alone here...

711
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.438
I am really tired
of this Lawrence Welk shit.

712
01:07:36.030 --> 01:07:38.700
- Go away.
- <i>Please.</i>

713
01:07:38.783 --> 01:07:40.910
<i>Please let me in.</i>

714
01:07:49.544 --> 01:07:52.589
Look, I wish that you hadn't witnessed
that awful scene tonight,

715
01:07:52.672 --> 01:07:54.591
but in a way, I'm glad.

716
01:07:54.674 --> 01:07:58.303
Why? So I could see
what freaks you and Dad really are?

717
01:07:58.386 --> 01:08:00.471
Me?

718
01:08:02.056 --> 01:08:04.809
Tsk. God.

719
01:08:04.892 --> 01:08:07.520
Oh, Christ. Mom.

720
01:08:07.604 --> 01:08:10.481
No, I'm glad because, uh...

721
01:08:12.734 --> 01:08:18.197
because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

722
01:08:18.281 --> 01:08:22.452
You cannot count
on anyone except yourself.

723
01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:30.460
You cannot count on
anyone except yourself.

724
01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.756
You know, it's sad but true,

725
01:08:34.839 --> 01:08:37.216
and the sooner you learn it,
the better.

726
01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.220
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here.

727
01:08:41.304 --> 01:08:44.140
You ungrateful little brat!

728
01:08:44.223 --> 01:08:47.268
Just look at everything
you have!

729
01:08:47.352 --> 01:08:49.938
When I was your age,
I lived in a duplex!

730
01:08:50.021 --> 01:08:53.983
We didn't even have
our own house.

731
01:10:53.603 --> 01:10:55.521
You little bastard!

732
01:10:55.605 --> 01:10:57.523
<i>Dad, no, I just...</i>

733
01:10:57.607 --> 01:10:59.692
How did you get in there?

734
01:10:59.776 --> 01:11:01.611
How? How?

735
01:11:03.571 --> 01:11:05.907
Come on! Get up!
Come on!

736
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:07.825
Get up!

737
01:11:07.909 --> 01:11:09.911
<i>Fight back,</i>
<i>you little pussy!</i>

738
01:11:09.994 --> 01:11:12.705
- No, sir, I won't fight you.
- How?

739
01:11:12.789 --> 01:11:15.750
- How did you get in there?
- I picked the lock, sir.

740
01:11:15.833 --> 01:11:19.504
What were you looking for, huh?
Money? Are you on dope again?

741
01:11:19.587 --> 01:11:23.383
No, sir. I wanted to show
my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

742
01:11:23.466 --> 01:11:25.260
A girlfriend?

743
01:11:25.343 --> 01:11:28.012
Yes, sir. She lives next door.

744
01:11:40.942 --> 01:11:43.611
<i>Her name's Jane.</i>

745
01:12:02.589 --> 01:12:05.508
This is for
your own good, boy.

746
01:12:07.844 --> 01:12:12.515
You have no respect for other
people's things and for authority...

747
01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:14.642
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

748
01:12:14.726 --> 01:12:18.896
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like.

749
01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.399
You can't.
There are rules in life.

750
01:12:21.482 --> 01:12:24.235
Yes, sir.

751
01:12:26.195 --> 01:12:29.616
You need structure, yeah.
You need...

752
01:12:29.699 --> 01:12:32.619
- Discipline.
- Yes, sir. Thank you for trying to teach me.

753
01:12:32.702 --> 01:12:35.038
Don't give up on me, Dad.

754
01:12:39.834 --> 01:12:41.753
Oh, Ricky.

755
01:12:46.716 --> 01:12:49.385
You stay out of there.

756
01:13:36.891 --> 01:13:39.143
- Whoo!
- I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham,

757
01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:43.189
when you first came here, I thought you
would be hopeless, but you're a natural.

758
01:13:43.273 --> 01:13:46.818
Well, all I know is
I love shooting this gun.

759
01:15:00.016 --> 01:15:01.935
What?

760
01:15:02.018 --> 01:15:04.646
Uh, whose car is that
out front?

761
01:15:04.729 --> 01:15:07.232
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,

762
01:15:07.315 --> 01:15:10.151
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.

763
01:15:10.235 --> 01:15:12.946
- I rule!
- Uh-huh. Where's the Camry?

764
01:15:13.029 --> 01:15:15.114
I traded it in.

765
01:15:15.198 --> 01:15:19.494
- Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
- Hm, let me think.

766
01:15:19.577 --> 01:15:21.829
No. You never drove it.

767
01:15:23.623 --> 01:15:26.626
Have you done something different?
You look great.

768
01:15:31.756 --> 01:15:33.675
Where's Jane?

769
01:15:33.758 --> 01:15:35.969
Jane not home.

770
01:15:42.517 --> 01:15:44.435
We have...

771
01:15:47.063 --> 01:15:50.108
the whole house...

772
01:15:50.191 --> 01:15:52.735
to ourselves.

773
01:15:54.904 --> 01:15:57.740
Christ, Carolyn.

774
01:15:57.824 --> 01:16:00.243
When did you become so...

775
01:16:01.911 --> 01:16:04.956
joyless?

776
01:16:05.039 --> 01:16:07.625
Joyless?

777
01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:10.253
I am not joyless.

778
01:16:10.336 --> 01:16:12.922
There happens to be
a lot about me...

779
01:16:13.006 --> 01:16:16.926
that you don't know,
Mr. Smarty Man.

780
01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:20.346
There's plenty of joy
in my life.

781
01:16:22.765 --> 01:16:25.268
Whatever happened to that girl...

782
01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:34.027
who used to fake seizures
at frat parties when she got bored?

783
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:38.948
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building...

784
01:16:39.032 --> 01:16:41.784
to flash
the traffic helicopters?

785
01:16:41.868 --> 01:16:46.539
Have you totally forgotten about her?

786
01:16:46.623 --> 01:16:48.791
Because I haven't.

787
01:17:01.888 --> 01:17:05.141
Lester, you're going
to spill beer on the couch.

788
01:17:12.232 --> 01:17:14.150
So what?
It's just a couch.

789
01:17:16.486 --> 01:17:18.780
This is a $4,000 sofa,

790
01:17:18.863 --> 01:17:20.782
upholstered in Italian silk.

791
01:17:20.865 --> 01:17:22.951
This is not just a couch.

792
01:17:23.034 --> 01:17:26.788
It's just... a... couch!

793
01:17:26.871 --> 01:17:29.082
This isn't life!

794
01:17:29.165 --> 01:17:31.334
This is just stuff,

795
01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:34.003
and it's become more important
to you than living.

796
01:17:34.087 --> 01:17:36.297
Well, honey,
that's just nuts.

797
01:17:45.348 --> 01:17:47.850
I'm only trying to help you!

798
01:17:52.981 --> 01:17:55.775
Don't.

799
01:17:55.858 --> 01:17:57.944
<i>Why?</i>

800
01:18:00.697 --> 01:18:03.199
It's weird watching myself.

801
01:18:03.283 --> 01:18:05.702
I don't like how I look.

802
01:18:08.288 --> 01:18:11.207
<i>I can't believe you don't know</i>
<i>how beautiful you are.</i>

803
01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:15.295
Look. I'm not going
to sit here for that shit.

804
01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.639
Ha! How does it feel now?

805
01:18:26.723 --> 01:18:28.683
Fine.

806
01:18:28.766 --> 01:18:30.768
You don't feel naked?

807
01:18:32.145 --> 01:18:34.397
I <i>am</i> naked.

808
01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.900
You know what I mean.

809
01:18:45.992 --> 01:18:49.078
So tell me about
being in the hospital.

810
01:18:52.081 --> 01:18:56.085
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

811
01:18:56.169 --> 01:19:01.341
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.

812
01:19:01.424 --> 01:19:04.928
I told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline, right?

813
01:19:05.011 --> 01:19:08.598
Of course,
I got kicked out.

814
01:19:08.681 --> 01:19:11.100
Dad and I had
this huge fight.

815
01:19:11.184 --> 01:19:14.312
<i>He hit me.</i>

816
01:19:14.395 --> 01:19:18.358
<i>And the next day at school,</i>
<i>some kid made a crack about my haircut,</i>

817
01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:22.278
and I just snapped.

818
01:19:25.949 --> 01:19:29.327
I wanted to kill him.

819
01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:31.788
I would've... killed him...

820
01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:36.376
if they hadn't pulled me off.

821
01:19:39.462 --> 01:19:43.508
That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.

822
01:19:43.591 --> 01:19:47.428
They drugged me up and left me
in there for two years.

823
01:19:48.888 --> 01:19:51.224
<i>Wow.</i>

824
01:19:51.307 --> 01:19:54.352
<i>You must really hate him.</i>

825
01:19:54.435 --> 01:19:57.105
No.

826
01:19:57.188 --> 01:19:59.357
He's not a bad man.

827
01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:04.070
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my
dad if he did something like that to me.

828
01:20:04.153 --> 01:20:05.947
<i>Wait.</i>

829
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:08.324
I already do hate my dad.

830
01:20:10.159 --> 01:20:12.287
Why?

831
01:20:14.289 --> 01:20:17.875
He's a total asshole;
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,

832
01:20:17.959 --> 01:20:20.169
and it's disgusting.

833
01:20:20.253 --> 01:20:23.798
You'd rather he had the crush on you.

834
01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:26.175
Gross. No.

835
01:20:29.554 --> 01:20:34.058
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.

836
01:20:37.145 --> 01:20:42.066
I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.

837
01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:45.403
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

838
01:20:45.486 --> 01:20:47.655
How?

839
01:20:47.739 --> 01:20:51.284
<i>Well, now I, too,</i>
<i>need structure,</i>

840
01:20:51.367 --> 01:20:54.537
a little fucking discipline.

841
01:21:05.089 --> 01:21:07.759
I'm serious, though.

842
01:21:07.842 --> 01:21:10.762
How could he not
be damaging me?

843
01:21:12.722 --> 01:21:15.642
I need a father
who's a role model,

844
01:21:15.725 --> 01:21:18.311
not some horny geek boy
who's going to spray his shorts...

845
01:21:18.394 --> 01:21:23.107
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

846
01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:25.443
What a lame-o.

847
01:21:27.904 --> 01:21:31.074
Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.

848
01:21:34.535 --> 01:21:37.247
Want me to kill him for you?

849
01:21:45.922 --> 01:21:48.091
Yeah. Would you?

850
01:21:49.842 --> 01:21:51.803
It'll cost you.

851
01:21:51.886 --> 01:21:54.555
I've been baby-sitting
since I was about ten.

852
01:21:54.639 --> 01:21:57.183
I've got almost $3,000.

853
01:21:59.769 --> 01:22:02.522
Of course I was saving it up
for a boob job.

854
01:22:04.023 --> 01:22:06.192
<i>But...</i>

855
01:22:19.706 --> 01:22:23.126
<i>You know, that's not</i>
<i>a very nice thing to do...</i>

856
01:22:25.503 --> 01:22:27.964
<i>hiring someone</i>
<i>to kill your dad.</i>

857
01:22:30.675 --> 01:22:35.346
Well, I guess I'm not
a very nice girl then, am I?

858
01:22:57.827 --> 01:23:00.538
You know I'm not serious, right?

859
01:23:01.623 --> 01:23:03.666
Of course.

860
01:23:18.306 --> 01:23:22.185
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?

861
01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.400
<i>Remember those posters that said...</i>

862
01:23:29.484 --> 01:23:33.863
<i>"Today is the first day</i>
<i>of the rest of your life"?</i>

863
01:23:33.947 --> 01:23:38.534
<i>Well, that's true</i>
<i>with every day except one...</i>

864
01:23:38.618 --> 01:23:40.828
<i>the day you die.</i>

865
01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:21.661
<i>Jane, hurry up.</i>

866
01:24:21.744 --> 01:24:24.831
I've got a very important
appointment.

867
01:24:24.914 --> 01:24:29.085
- Is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?
- She's always welcome.

868
01:24:29.168 --> 01:24:33.548
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

869
01:24:40.513 --> 01:24:42.473
What?

870
01:24:42.557 --> 01:24:45.643
I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over,

871
01:24:45.727 --> 01:24:48.313
because of you and that way
that you behave.

872
01:24:48.396 --> 01:24:51.733
- What are you talking about? I've barely even spoken to her.
- <i>Dad!</i>

873
01:24:51.816 --> 01:24:55.153
You stare at her all the time
like you're drunk!

874
01:24:55.236 --> 01:24:57.488
- <i>It's disgusting!</i>
- You better watch yourself,

875
01:24:57.572 --> 01:25:02.243
or you're going to turn into
a real bitch just like your mother!

876
01:25:04.495 --> 01:25:06.414
Oh, fuck.

877
01:25:14.339 --> 01:25:16.841
You ready to go?

878
01:25:16.925 --> 01:25:19.093
Oh, I-I don't need a ride.

879
01:25:19.177 --> 01:25:21.596
I'm going with Jane
and her mom.

880
01:25:28.603 --> 01:25:30.521
Oh, morning!

881
01:25:30.605 --> 01:25:32.565
<i>Yo, Ricky!</i>

882
01:25:32.649 --> 01:25:35.568
- How's it going?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

883
01:25:35.652 --> 01:25:37.779
Hey. Wait.

884
01:26:56.357 --> 01:26:59.277
<i>I need that Super Smiley</i>
<i>with cheese ASAP!</i>

885
01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.238
- You need more than that, my little hombre.
- <i>May I take your order?</i>

886
01:27:02.322 --> 01:27:05.325
- <i>Oh, yeah! What's good here?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>

887
01:27:05.408 --> 01:27:08.453
<i>Oh, well, then I guess</i>
<i>we'll just have to be bad, won't we?</i>

888
01:27:08.536 --> 01:27:11.873
I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,

889
01:27:11.956 --> 01:27:14.459
- <i>curly fries and a vanilla shake.</i>
- <i>Make that two.</i>

890
01:27:14.542 --> 01:27:18.379
<i>That'll be 7.98. Please</i>
<i>drive up to the window. Thank you.</i>

891
01:27:18.463 --> 01:27:22.884
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.

892
01:27:24.886 --> 01:27:28.389
- Did you know that?
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

893
01:27:28.473 --> 01:27:31.100
Smile!
You're at Mr. Smiley's!

894
01:27:32.727 --> 01:27:35.813
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?

895
01:27:35.897 --> 01:27:38.358
Just $1.99 for
a limited time only.

896
01:27:38.441 --> 01:27:43.404
- We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is my...
- <i>Her husband.</i>

897
01:27:43.488 --> 01:27:45.907
We've met before,
but something tells me...

898
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:48.368
you're going
to remember me this time.

899
01:27:48.451 --> 01:27:50.495
<i>Whoa!</i>

900
01:27:50.578 --> 01:27:53.581
You are so busted.

901
01:27:53.665 --> 01:27:55.708
This really doesn't concern you.

902
01:27:55.792 --> 01:28:00.505
Well, actually, Janine is senior
drive-thru manager, so you are on her turf.

903
01:28:02.799 --> 01:28:07.345
So, this makes sense.

904
01:28:07.428 --> 01:28:09.889
- Oh, Lester...
- <i>Honey, it's okay.</i>

905
01:28:09.973 --> 01:28:13.726
I want you to be happy.
Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?

906
01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:15.728
- Lester, just stop it!
- <i>No, no.</i>

907
01:28:15.812 --> 01:28:17.897
You...

908
01:28:17.981 --> 01:28:21.067
don't get to tell me
what to do...

909
01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:23.528
ever again.

910
01:28:37.458 --> 01:28:39.460
I'm sorry.

911
01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.840
I guess we should
cool it for a while.

912
01:28:45.925 --> 01:28:49.053
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.

913
01:28:49.137 --> 01:28:52.056
No, no,
I understand completely.

914
01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:54.475
It's...

915
01:28:54.559 --> 01:28:59.772
"In order to be successful, one must
project an image of success at all times."

916
01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:28.343
Stop it. Stop it.

917
01:30:07.048 --> 01:30:10.343
Shit.

918
01:30:17.308 --> 01:30:19.394
I have to run next door.

919
01:30:19.477 --> 01:30:23.565
Jane left her geometry book in my bag,
and she needs it to do her homework.

920
01:30:32.323 --> 01:30:37.078
So you and psycho boy are fucking on,
like, a regular basis now, right?

921
01:30:37.161 --> 01:30:39.163
No.

922
01:30:39.247 --> 01:30:42.333
Come on. You can tell me.
Does he have a big dick?

923
01:30:42.417 --> 01:30:46.838
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, okay? It's not like that.

924
01:30:46.921 --> 01:30:50.258
Not like what?
Doesn't he have one?

925
01:30:50.341 --> 01:30:52.594
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

926
01:30:52.677 --> 01:30:56.055
- I tell you every detail about every guy that I fuck.
- Yeah.

927
01:30:56.139 --> 01:31:00.977
Maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I
really don't want to hear about all that.

928
01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:04.772
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're, like, above it?

929
01:31:04.856 --> 01:31:08.860
We got to get you
a real man.

930
01:31:28.796 --> 01:31:32.383
- You got any papers?
- Yeah, in the cigar box right over there.

931
01:31:32.467 --> 01:31:36.054
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a
pushover. "No, I can't, really. Okay."

932
01:31:36.137 --> 01:31:38.389
You should learn
to roll a joint.

933
01:32:42.537 --> 01:32:44.706
<i>Oh! Hi.</i>

934
01:32:44.789 --> 01:32:47.792
- <i>Where's Mom?</i>
- Don't know.

935
01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:51.129
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.
- Hi.

936
01:32:51.212 --> 01:32:55.633
Wow, look at you.
Have you been working out?

937
01:32:55.717 --> 01:32:58.386
Some.

938
01:33:01.931 --> 01:33:04.225
You can really tell.

939
01:33:06.644 --> 01:33:08.730
Look at those arms.

940
01:33:13.192 --> 01:33:15.403
You like... muscles?

941
01:33:16.988 --> 01:33:21.910
I should probably
go see what Jane's up to.

942
01:33:33.046 --> 01:33:35.298
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

943
01:33:37.258 --> 01:33:40.345
- <i>From my job.</i>
- Don't lie to me.

944
01:33:42.972 --> 01:33:45.934
Now, I saw you with him.

945
01:33:46.017 --> 01:33:48.436
You were watching me?

946
01:33:49.604 --> 01:33:51.856
What does he make you do?

947
01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:54.400
Oh.

948
01:33:54.484 --> 01:33:57.237
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham...

949
01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:00.531
Don't you laugh at me!

950
01:34:00.615 --> 01:34:05.536
I will not sit back and watch
my only son become a cock sucker!

951
01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:07.538
Jesus, what is it with you?

952
01:34:10.291 --> 01:34:12.627
I swear to God...

953
01:34:12.710 --> 01:34:15.421
I'll throw you out of this house
and never look at you again!

954
01:34:15.505 --> 01:34:19.550
- You mean that.
- You're damn straight I do!

955
01:34:19.634 --> 01:34:23.554
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fuckin' faggot!

956
01:34:34.732 --> 01:34:36.985
You're right.

957
01:34:40.321 --> 01:34:43.283
- I suck dick for money.
- Boy, don't start.

958
01:34:43.366 --> 01:34:47.245
- Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
- Get out!

959
01:34:47.328 --> 01:34:51.791
You should see me fuck. I'm the
best piece of ass in three states.

960
01:34:51.874 --> 01:34:55.670
Damn it, get out!
I don't ever want to see you again.

961
01:35:01.593 --> 01:35:05.597
What a sad...
old man you are.

962
01:35:06.848 --> 01:35:08.766
Get out.

963
01:35:34.667 --> 01:35:38.296
Mom... I'm leaving.

964
01:35:38.379 --> 01:35:40.548
Okay.

965
01:35:43.217 --> 01:35:45.219
Wear a raincoat.

966
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:55.230
I wish things would have
been better for you.

967
01:35:59.234 --> 01:36:01.236
Take care of Dad.

968
01:36:33.184 --> 01:36:35.728
<i>disinvesting problems of power...</i>

969
01:36:35.812 --> 01:36:38.648
<i>and removing their ability</i>
<i>to make us afraid.</i>

970
01:36:38.731 --> 01:36:42.068
<i>This is the secret</i>
<i>to "Me-Centered Living."</i>

971
01:36:42.151 --> 01:36:44.862
<i>Only by taking</i>
<i>full responsibility...</i>

972
01:36:44.946 --> 01:36:47.323
<i>for your actions</i>
<i>and their solutions...</i>

973
01:36:47.407 --> 01:36:51.369
<i>will you ever break free</i>
<i>from the constant cycle of victimhood.</i>

974
01:36:51.452 --> 01:36:56.874
You are only a victim if you choose
to be a victim. We all have the power...

975
01:36:56.958 --> 01:36:59.586
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>we can be friends any more!</i>

976
01:36:59.669 --> 01:37:01.588
<i>You're too uptight about sex.</i>

977
01:37:01.671 --> 01:37:05.008
Just don't fuck my dad,
all right?

978
01:37:05.091 --> 01:37:07.218
- Please?
- Why not?

979
01:37:07.302 --> 01:37:10.722
Dad, leave us alone!

980
01:37:10.805 --> 01:37:13.266
<i>It's me.</i>

981
01:37:13.349 --> 01:37:16.644
- If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me?
- What?

982
01:37:16.728 --> 01:37:20.315
If I had to go to New York to live,
tonight, would you come with me?

983
01:37:21.983 --> 01:37:24.027
Yes.

984
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:28.573
<i>You guys can't be serious. You're just</i>
<i>a kid, and he's, like, a mental case.</i>

985
01:37:28.656 --> 01:37:32.577
- <i>You'll end up living in a box on the street.</i>
- I'm no more a kid than you are.

986
01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:35.872
- <i>We can use my plastic surgery money.</i>
- We won't have to.

987
01:37:35.955 --> 01:37:39.667
I have over $40,000. I know people
in the city that can help us get set up.

988
01:37:39.751 --> 01:37:42.921
- What, other drug dealers?
- Yes.

989
01:37:43.004 --> 01:37:46.007
- You'd be out of your mind to go with him.
- Why do you even care?

990
01:37:46.090 --> 01:37:49.093
- Because you're my friend.
- She's not your friend.

991
01:37:49.177 --> 01:37:51.429
She's someone you use
to feel better about yourself.

992
01:37:51.512 --> 01:37:54.933
- Go fuck yourself, psycho!
- Hey, shut up, bitch!

993
01:37:55.016 --> 01:37:58.102
- Jane, he's a freak!
- Well, then so am I!

994
01:37:58.186 --> 01:38:01.522
We'll always be freaks,
and we'll never be like other people!

995
01:38:01.606 --> 01:38:05.318
And you'll never be a freak
'cause you're just... too perfect!

996
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:09.697
Yeah, well,
at least I'm not ugly.

997
01:38:11.532 --> 01:38:13.660
Yes, you are.

998
01:38:13.743 --> 01:38:17.288
And you're boring,
and you're totally ordinary,

999
01:38:17.372 --> 01:38:19.958
<i>and you know it.</i>

1000
01:38:22.335 --> 01:38:24.504
You two deserve each other.

1001
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:27.609
Jesus, man,
you're soaked.

1002
01:39:38.202 --> 01:39:42.123
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.

1003
01:39:43.458 --> 01:39:45.585
Are you okay?

1004
01:39:45.668 --> 01:39:47.629
Where's your wife?

1005
01:39:49.172 --> 01:39:51.257
Uh, I don't know.

1006
01:39:51.341 --> 01:39:55.303
Probably out fucking that dorky
Prince of Real Estate asshole.

1007
01:39:56.638 --> 01:39:59.224
And you know what?

1008
01:39:59.307 --> 01:40:01.267
I don't care.

1009
01:40:11.653 --> 01:40:14.572
Your wife is
with another man, and...

1010
01:40:14.656 --> 01:40:16.741
you don't care?

1011
01:40:18.993 --> 01:40:21.412
Nope.

1012
01:40:21.496 --> 01:40:24.249
Our marriage is just for show.

1013
01:40:24.332 --> 01:40:27.502
A commercial
for how normal we are...

1014
01:40:27.585 --> 01:40:29.796
when we're anything but.

1015
01:40:37.428 --> 01:40:39.597
Jesus, man,
you are shaking.

1016
01:40:39.681 --> 01:40:43.518
We really ought to get you
out of these clothes.

1017
01:40:43.601 --> 01:40:46.437
Yeah.

1018
01:40:46.521 --> 01:40:49.607
It's okay.

1019
01:40:52.026 --> 01:40:55.280
I... am...

1020
01:40:55.363 --> 01:40:58.366
You just tell me what you need.

1021
01:41:01.578 --> 01:41:04.122
It's okay.

1022
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:21.723
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1023
01:41:25.310 --> 01:41:27.770
I'm sorry.

1024
01:41:27.854 --> 01:41:30.356
Y-You got the wrong idea.

1025
01:42:07.268 --> 01:42:09.771
<i>"I refuse to be a victim."</i>

1026
01:42:09.854 --> 01:42:12.106
<i>When this becomes your mantra,</i>

1027
01:42:12.190 --> 01:42:15.151
<i>constantly reinforcing</i>
<i>your new non...</i>

1028
01:42:17.862 --> 01:42:21.282
I refuse to be a victim!

1029
01:43:05.034 --> 01:43:08.288
I hope you don't mind
if I play the stereo.

1030
01:43:08.371 --> 01:43:10.623
<i>Not at all.</i>

1031
01:43:10.707 --> 01:43:13.376
Bad night?

1032
01:43:13.459 --> 01:43:16.546
<i>Not really bad, just...</i>

1033
01:43:16.629 --> 01:43:18.631
strange.

1034
01:43:18.715 --> 01:43:23.428
<i>Believe me, it couldn't possibly be</i>
<i>any stranger than mine.</i>

1035
01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:34.480
Jane and I had a fight.

1036
01:43:34.564 --> 01:43:36.691
It was about you.

1037
01:43:39.319 --> 01:43:42.447
<i>She's mad at me because...</i>

1038
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:44.824
I said I think you're sexy.

1039
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:48.995
Do you want a sip?

1040
01:43:49.078 --> 01:43:51.664
Sure.

1041
01:44:19.359 --> 01:44:22.862
So.

1042
01:44:22.946 --> 01:44:26.157
You gonna tell me?

1043
01:44:29.619 --> 01:44:32.163
What do you want?

1044
01:44:35.124 --> 01:44:38.878
I don't know.

1045
01:44:38.962 --> 01:44:43.508
You... don't know?

1046
01:44:43.591 --> 01:44:47.053
What do you want?

1047
01:44:47.136 --> 01:44:50.139
Are you kidding?

1048
01:44:50.223 --> 01:44:53.434
I want you.

1049
01:44:56.104 --> 01:44:59.816
I've wanted you since
the first moment I saw you.

1050
01:45:02.235 --> 01:45:05.780
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1051
01:45:13.413 --> 01:45:16.749
You don't think I'm ordinary?

1052
01:45:18.626 --> 01:45:22.547
You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.

1053
01:45:24.966 --> 01:45:27.719
Thank you.

1054
01:45:27.802 --> 01:45:32.390
I don't think there's anything
worse than being ordinary.

1055
01:45:49.908 --> 01:45:52.410
I refuse to be a victim.

1056
01:45:52.493 --> 01:45:55.914
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.

1057
01:45:55.997 --> 01:45:58.082
Lester,

1058
01:45:58.166 --> 01:46:00.960
I have something
I have to say to you.

1059
01:46:49.884 --> 01:46:53.137
Are you scared?

1060
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:55.682
I don't get scared.

1061
01:46:58.309 --> 01:47:01.062
My parents will try
to find me.

1062
01:47:01.145 --> 01:47:04.190
Mine won't.

1063
01:47:24.419 --> 01:47:27.380
This is my first time.

1064
01:47:29.882 --> 01:47:32.010
You're kidding.

1065
01:47:32.093 --> 01:47:34.095
I'm sorry.

1066
01:47:34.178 --> 01:47:36.806
I still want to do it.

1067
01:47:36.890 --> 01:47:40.184
I just... thought
I should tell you...

1068
01:47:40.268 --> 01:47:42.478
in case you wondered why I...

1069
01:47:42.562 --> 01:47:45.398
I wasn't... better.

1070
01:47:58.578 --> 01:48:00.830
What's wrong?

1071
01:48:06.878 --> 01:48:10.673
<i>I thought you said</i>
<i>I was beautiful.</i>

1072
01:48:10.757 --> 01:48:12.800
You <i>are</i> beautiful.

1073
01:48:15.511 --> 01:48:19.140
You are so... beautiful.

1074
01:48:22.477 --> 01:48:24.938
And I would be a very...

1075
01:48:25.021 --> 01:48:26.981
lucky man.

1076
01:48:28.316 --> 01:48:30.944
I feel so stupid.

1077
01:48:31.027 --> 01:48:33.529
Don't.

1078
01:48:33.613 --> 01:48:36.658
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

1079
01:48:36.741 --> 01:48:40.745
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

1080
01:48:40.828 --> 01:48:43.748
It's okay.

1081
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:47.126
Everything's okay.

1082
01:49:02.183 --> 01:49:04.936
Wow, I was starving.

1083
01:49:05.019 --> 01:49:09.524
- Do you want me to make you another one?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

1084
01:49:09.607 --> 01:49:11.943
You sure?

1085
01:49:12.026 --> 01:49:17.031
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better. Thanks.

1086
01:49:20.493 --> 01:49:24.205
- How's Jane?
- What do you mean?

1087
01:49:25.707 --> 01:49:28.167
I mean,

1088
01:49:28.251 --> 01:49:30.628
how's her life?

1089
01:49:30.712 --> 01:49:32.839
Is she happy?

1090
01:49:32.922 --> 01:49:36.092
Is she miserable?

1091
01:49:36.175 --> 01:49:40.722
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

1092
01:49:43.057 --> 01:49:46.311
She's, uh...

1093
01:49:46.394 --> 01:49:49.439
She's really happy.

1094
01:49:49.522 --> 01:49:53.067
She thinks she's in love.

1095
01:50:03.786 --> 01:50:07.081
Good for her.

1096
01:50:08.917 --> 01:50:10.835
How are you?

1097
01:50:18.801 --> 01:50:22.263
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

1098
01:50:28.686 --> 01:50:31.397
I'm great.

1099
01:50:37.111 --> 01:50:40.114
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

1100
01:50:52.877 --> 01:50:55.213
I'm great.

1101
01:51:29.497 --> 01:51:32.584
Man, oh man.

1102
01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:37.297
Man, oh man, oh man.

1103
01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.001
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1104
01:52:56.918 --> 01:52:59.045
Wow.

1105
01:53:00.630 --> 01:53:03.383
<i>I had always</i>
<i>heard your entire life flashes...</i>

1106
01:53:03.466 --> 01:53:07.345
<i>in front of your eyes</i>
<i>the second before you die.</i>

1107
01:53:07.428 --> 01:53:10.181
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>that one second...</i>

1108
01:53:10.265 --> 01:53:13.017
<i>isn't a second at all.</i>

1109
01:53:13.101 --> 01:53:15.186
<i>It stretches on forever,</i>

1110
01:53:15.270 --> 01:53:18.106
<i>like an ocean of time.</i>

1111
01:53:20.066 --> 01:53:23.069
<i>For me, it was</i>
<i>lying on my back...</i>

1112
01:53:23.152 --> 01:53:27.031
<i>at Boy Scout camp,</i>
<i>watching falling stars.</i>

1113
01:53:35.415 --> 01:53:38.668
<i>And yellow leaves</i>
<i>from the maple trees...</i>

1114
01:53:38.751 --> 01:53:41.170
<i>that lined our street.</i>

1115
01:53:49.971 --> 01:53:53.224
<i>Or my grandmother's hands</i>
<i>and the way her skin...</i>

1116
01:53:53.308 --> 01:53:55.643
<i>seemed like paper.</i>

1117
01:54:02.901 --> 01:54:06.654
<i>And the first time</i>
<i>I saw my cousin Tony's...</i>

1118
01:54:06.738 --> 01:54:09.699
<i>brand-new Firebird.</i>

1119
01:54:21.419 --> 01:54:23.504
<i>And Janie.</i>

1120
01:54:24.923 --> 01:54:26.841
<i>And Janie.</i>

1121
01:54:58.831 --> 01:55:01.209
<i>And... Carolyn.</i>

1122
01:55:06.214 --> 01:55:09.968
<i>I guess I could be pretty pissed off</i>
<i>about what happened to me,</i>

1123
01:55:10.051 --> 01:55:15.557
<i>but it's hard to stay mad when</i>
<i>there's so much beauty in the world.</i>

1124
01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:20.812
<i>Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing</i>
<i>it all at once and it's too much.</i>

1125
01:55:20.895 --> 01:55:25.984
<i>My heart fills up like a balloon</i>
<i>that's about to burst.</i>

1126
01:55:26.067 --> 01:55:30.154
<i>And then I remember</i>
<i>to relax...</i>

1127
01:55:30.238 --> 01:55:33.324
<i>and stop trying</i>
<i>to hold on to it.</i>

1128
01:55:33.408 --> 01:55:36.995
<i>And then it flows</i>
<i>through me like rain,</i>

1129
01:55:37.078 --> 01:55:40.748
<i>and I can't feel anything</i>
<i>but gratitude...</i>

1130
01:55:40.832 --> 01:55:43.001
<i>for every single moment...</i>

1131
01:55:43.084 --> 01:55:47.005
<i>of my stupid little life.</i>

1132
01:55:47.088 --> 01:55:50.508
<i>You have no idea what</i>
<i>I'm talking about, I'm sure.</i>

1133
01:55:50.592 --> 01:55:52.594
<i>But don't worry.</i>

1134
01:55:53.678 --> 01:55:56.014
<i>You will someday.</i>
