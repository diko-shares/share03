00:02:48.757 --> 00:02:50.382
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>
<i>How are you doing this afternoon?</i>

2
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:52.203
<i>Now, is this Rose Hill?</i>

3
00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:54.414
<i>Good.
This is Ed Couch.</i>

4
00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:55.477
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

5
00:02:55.518 --> 00:02:58.273
<i>I, I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.</i>

6
00:02:58.476 --> 00:03:01.070
<i>I need to get up there and see her,
but I'm gonna be a little bit late,</i>

7
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:03.648
<i>because, I'll tell you what,
I'm lost out here.</i>

8
00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.507
<i>We are off the Alabama Interstate,
but I don't know where.</i>

9
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.570
<i>Okay.</i>

10
00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:45.044
Did you hear that?

11
00:03:45.138 --> 00:03:46.458
What?

12
00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.958
The train.

13
00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.458
No, I didn't hear no train.

14
00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.282
Oh, nothing, I guess.

15
00:03:56.798 --> 00:03:58.790
Where's Whistle Stop on the map?

16
00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.290
I can't find it.

17
00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.587
Why did you tell me to turn right
ten miles back there, then?

18
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.573
God, you've got a negative sense
of direction, honey.

19
00:04:10.238 --> 00:04:12.018
I'm sorry.

20
00:04:12.647 --> 00:04:16.729
Oh, Ed, your aunt's gonna be
so disappointed we're late.

21
00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:20.763
I know she's been looking
forward to this visit all week long.

22
00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.415
Bless her sweet little old heart.

23
00:04:28.731 --> 00:04:31.473
Hey, how's my sweet
Auntie V this afternoon?

24
00:04:31.513 --> 00:04:32.826
Remember us?

25
00:04:32.865 --> 00:04:34.014
Come on in.

26
00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:35.318
<i>Don't you look pretty?</i>

27
00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:38.232
<i>- We've brought you something this sweet.
- Oh, let me look at you.</i>

28
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.943
<i>Honey, don't panic.</i>

29
00:04:40.015 --> 00:04:42.732
<i>Don't you know
Evelyn loves you?</i>

30
00:04:43.412 --> 00:04:44.990
Well, honey.

31
00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:48.045
I guess it'd be better if you just wait
out here for me or something.

32
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.654
I'll, I'll get all this stuff.

33
00:04:49.717 --> 00:04:50.764
Well, if...

34
00:04:50.794 --> 00:04:52.560
If you think it's best.

35
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.635
Yeah, I do, this time.
Okay?

36
00:04:56.274 --> 00:04:58.196
Have a nice day, Aunt Vesta.

37
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.290
<i>Don't you pitch a fit like that</i>

38
00:05:12.563 --> 00:05:15.125
Did you know they took
my gall bladder out?

39
00:05:16.008 --> 00:05:17.938
Uh, no, I didn't.

40
00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.860
Oh, yes.

41
00:05:20.047 --> 00:05:23.071
Still in the hospital in a jar.

42
00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:26.305
I guess that's where they keep them.

43
00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:28.518
I guess.

44
00:05:29.104 --> 00:05:31.291
When I was in the hospital,

45
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:35.831
the nurse gave me one of them
Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

46
00:05:36.448 --> 00:05:38.182
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode.

47
00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:40.784
82-year-old widow.
Imagine that.

48
00:05:41.526 --> 00:05:44.424
Actually, everybody calls me Ninny.

49
00:05:44.643 --> 00:05:47.534
Of course, I'm just visiting here.

50
00:05:48.026 --> 00:05:51.174
Did you ever have
one of them Fleet enemas?

51
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:53.424
Um...

52
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.823
Well...

53
00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:56.713
No.

54
00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.823
You'd remember it.

55
00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:03.190
Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,
come from Whistle Stop.

56
00:06:03.418 --> 00:06:05.926
You ever been to Whistle Stop?

57
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.004
Why, yes.
I just passed by there today.

58
00:06:09.082 --> 00:06:13.147
She's lived down the street from me
for, oh, 30 years or more.

59
00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.943
After her son died,...

60
00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:19.748
her daughter-in-law had a fit for her
to come live here at the nursing home,

61
00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.404
and they asked me to come with her
and be her roommate.

62
00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.037
Mrs. Otis don't know it,

63
00:06:24.068 --> 00:06:28.459
but I'm going back home
just as soon as she gets settled in good.

64
00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:33.029
Does the name "Idgie Threadgoode"
ring a bell?

65
00:06:33.162 --> 00:06:34.584
Um...

66
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.928
No, ma'am.
I don't think so.

67
00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:39.217
You'd remember her.

68
00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:43.545
You see, I was practically adopted
by the Threadgoode family.

69
00:06:43.584 --> 00:06:45.842
- I married her brother, Cleo.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

70
00:06:45.907 --> 00:06:47.095
Yeah.

71
00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:50.729
Idgie and her friend, Ruth,
ran the Whistle Stop CafÃ©.

72
00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:52.158
Oh.

73
00:06:52.893 --> 00:06:56.463
Idgie was a character, all right.

74
00:06:56.836 --> 00:07:03.351
But, how anybody could have thought
she murdered that man is beyond me.

75
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.562
I beg your pardon?

76
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:08.836
Well, you sit and relax awhile.
I'll tell you all about it.

77
00:07:08.965 --> 00:07:11.140
Oh, now, let's see um...

78
00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:15.626
I remember the day they pulled
that truck up out of the river.

79
00:07:15.915 --> 00:07:19.103
<i>That same rainy summer day,</i>

80
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.462
<i>Idgie Threadgoode was arrested</i>

81
00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:24.095
<i>for the murder
of the owner of that truck,</i>

82
00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:26.111
<i>Frank Bennett.</i>

83
00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:31.833
I guess to understand Idgie,

84
00:07:31.857 --> 00:07:36.013
you'd have to start way back
with her brother, Buddy.

85
00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:41.606
<i>Idgie was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.</i>

86
00:07:43.003 --> 00:07:46.673
<i>I remember the day we was all
getting ready for Leona's wedding.</i>

87
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.657
<i>The war had just ended.</i>

88
00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:50.813
<i>The, the "Great" one, you know.</i>

89
00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:54.917
<i>And another one was about
to begin in the Threadgoode house.</i>

90
00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:59.087
<i>Sipsey, honey, is that finished?</i>

91
00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:00.165
<i>What you doing?</i>

92
00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:02.190
Oh, Buddy.
Buddy, get dressed, honey.

93
00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:04.643
<i>- Mama?</i>
- Leona, what is it?

94
00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:05.977
Idgie's upstairs in her room,

95
00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:08.610
and she, she said she won't come out
just as long as she lives.

96
00:08:08.641 --> 00:08:10.993
- Mama, she is gonna ruin my wedding.
- Shh.

97
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:13.964
Why, Leona, you're gonna be
the most beautiful bride, you hear?

98
00:08:13.995 --> 00:08:16.987
Well, of course she is, Papa.

99
00:08:17.604 --> 00:08:20.073
Your papa has spent
every last nickel he has

100
00:08:20.112 --> 00:08:21.519
just to make you happy.

101
00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:24.792
Now, you try to act
a little grateful, young lady.

102
00:08:25.447 --> 00:08:27.846
Imogen Louise Threadgoode!

103
00:08:28.654 --> 00:08:30.609
This is your mama!

104
00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:35.429
You come down here...

105
00:08:35.508 --> 00:08:36.719
right now.

106
00:08:36.764 --> 00:08:38.462
Do you hear me?

107
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:40.205
Buddy, you go fetch her.
She'll listen to you.

108
00:08:40.244 --> 00:08:41.299
Come on down, Little Bit.

109
00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.423
There's no firing squad waiting for you.

110
00:08:43.482 --> 00:08:45.166
Ohh.

111
00:08:45.214 --> 00:08:46.712
Come on, honey.

112
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.034
Now, let us see you.

113
00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:51.737
Oh, you look so pretty.

114
00:08:51.796 --> 00:08:54.995
- I see London, I see...
<i>- Hush!</i>

115
00:08:56.266 --> 00:08:58.229
Julian, hush.

116
00:08:59.526 --> 00:09:01.409
Come ahead, sweetheart.

117
00:09:03.073 --> 00:09:05.705
<i>You look awful nice in that.</i>

118
00:09:05.847 --> 00:09:07.009
Mama!

119
00:09:07.034 --> 00:09:08.385
You look fine, Idgie.

120
00:09:08.424 --> 00:09:10.760
- She looks like a monkey.
- Julian.

121
00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:12.440
Stop it right this second.

122
00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:13.963
- Take it back!
- Idgie!

123
00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:15.917
- Take it back.
- Hey, hey, hey.

124
00:09:16.166 --> 00:09:18.527
I told you she was
gonna ruin my wedding!

125
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.604
Idgie, get up.

126
00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:21.065
Take it back!

127
00:09:21.096 --> 00:09:22.432
Take it back!

128
00:09:23.338 --> 00:09:25.066
Tell him to take it back.

129
00:09:25.128 --> 00:09:27.273
- I'll get you for this.
- No, Buddy.

130
00:09:28.559 --> 00:09:31.770
<i>Julian, I am really cross with you now...</i>

131
00:09:31.855 --> 00:09:34.207
<i>You know that we have to be careful
when she's dressing up.</i>

132
00:09:34.254 --> 00:09:36.285
<i>- Pain! She's just a pain.
- You know it matters to her.</i>

133
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.988
<i>- My wedding is ruining.
- Leona, will you stop shrieking, honey?</i>

134
00:09:39.192 --> 00:09:40.777
<i>This is your wedding day.</i>

135
00:09:53.275 --> 00:09:55.848
Looks like you got yourself
up a tree, Little Bit.

136
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.480
I'm sick of people making fun of me.

137
00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.504
So you're gonna stay
up here all day long?

138
00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:03.637
Yep.

139
00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:04.957
The hell with them.

140
00:10:05.043 --> 00:10:08.246
Who wants to wear
that stupid old dress anyway?

141
00:10:09.723 --> 00:10:11.434
Did I ever tell you
about the oysters?

142
00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:12.496
Oysters?

143
00:10:12.534 --> 00:10:14.699
- Didn't I tell you about the oysters?
- No.

144
00:10:15.044 --> 00:10:16.894
<i>Think about all the millions of oysters</i>

145
00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:19.411
just lying around
on the bottom of the ocean.

146
00:10:19.622 --> 00:10:21.402
And then one day...

147
00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:24.402
God comes along and
He sees one and He says,

148
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:27.113
"I think I'm gonna make
that one different."

149
00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:29.331
Did you know what He does?

150
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:32.261
He puts a little piece of sand in it.

151
00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:35.792
And guess what it can do
that the others can't.

152
00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:37.323
What?

153
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.995
It can make a beautiful pearl.

154
00:10:40.804 --> 00:10:43.236
What if God made a mistake?

155
00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:45.176
Well...

156
00:10:45.215 --> 00:10:46.465
the way I figure it...

157
00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:48.166
He never makes mistakes.

158
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.439
I mean, He made sure
we got together.

159
00:10:50.752 --> 00:10:55.082
He made sure you got the best-looking,
most charming brother in the world,

160
00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:56.910
who's gonna beat you
to the chocolate cake.

161
00:10:56.942 --> 00:10:58.887
You will not.

162
00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:02.197
I got you out of the tree now,
didn't I?

163
00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:04.105
Did not.

164
00:11:04.314 --> 00:11:07.962
<i>Into this estate, these two people
come now to be joined.</i>

165
00:11:08.056 --> 00:11:10.265
<i>If any man present can show cause</i>

166
00:11:10.304 --> 00:11:12.812
<i>why they might not
lawfully be joined together,</i>

167
00:11:12.878 --> 00:11:16.788
let him speak now,
or forever after hold his peace.

168
00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.074
Please, be seated.

169
00:11:22.692 --> 00:11:24.293
If either of you know any reason

170
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.535
<i>why you may not justly
be joined together in holy matrimony</i>

171
00:11:28.778 --> 00:11:30.824
do you now confess it?

172
00:11:40.692 --> 00:11:43.130
It is in your will to proceed.

173
00:11:43.497 --> 00:11:46.442
<i>Do you, Charles Osgood Justice--?</i>

174
00:11:52.397 --> 00:11:54.102
<i>Thank you.
I don't know what we'd do</i>

175
00:11:54.142 --> 00:11:56.001
<i>without your generosity
and your kindness.</i>

176
00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:57.579
<i>Sipsey, honey, especially you.</i>

177
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.548
<i>- Look at what you've done.
- Oh, you're welcome, Mrs. Threadgoode.</i>

178
00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:03.550
Give me that,
you rascal, you!

179
00:12:07.816 --> 00:12:08.855
Oh!

180
00:12:08.886 --> 00:12:11.051
- Jump on my back.
<i>- I don't think that there ever was</i>

181
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.347
<i>a sweeter boy than
Buddy Threadgoode.</i>

182
00:12:13.372 --> 00:12:15.215
You look beautiful today, Lily.

183
00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:17.664
Yes.
Lily, you sure do.

184
00:12:17.722 --> 00:12:20.683
<i>I had the biggest crush on him.</i>

185
00:12:21.436 --> 00:12:23.613
<i>He was a terrible ï¬irt.</i>

186
00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:27.121
<i>But, his heart belonged to Ruth Jamison.</i>

187
00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:30.972
<i>Now, she was the daughter
of a friend of his mama's</i>

188
00:12:31.002 --> 00:12:33.082
<i>who was visiting that summer.</i>

189
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.957
Ruth Jamison,

190
00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:36.981
you're just the one
I've been looking for.

191
00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:38.480
Are you thirsty?

192
00:12:38.527 --> 00:12:40.730
Let's go visit someplace else.

193
00:12:46.563 --> 00:12:47.657
If you think that's a big lake,

194
00:12:47.689 --> 00:12:49.571
you should've seen the one
next to our house.

195
00:12:49.609 --> 00:12:51.501
We used to swim in it and fish.

196
00:12:51.548 --> 00:12:53.079
I sure do miss it.

197
00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:54.423
I sure do.

198
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.868
Well, what happened to it?

199
00:12:55.915 --> 00:12:57.165
Did it dry up?

200
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.937
No, worse than that.

201
00:12:58.976 --> 00:13:00.624
You see, last fall,
a big flock of ducks,

202
00:13:00.663 --> 00:13:04.162
about 40 or 50 of them,
landed right smack in the middle of it.

203
00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.601
While they were sitting in it,
this fluke thing happened.

204
00:13:06.632 --> 00:13:10.085
You see, the temperature dropped so fast
that the whole lake froze...

205
00:13:10.187 --> 00:13:11.790
in three seconds,
just like that.

206
00:13:11.837 --> 00:13:13.603
No, those poor little ducks.

207
00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:14.720
Did it kill them?

208
00:13:14.751 --> 00:13:16.157
No, they flew off...

209
00:13:16.205 --> 00:13:17.663
and took the lake with them.

210
00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:21.194
Why, to this very day,
that lake is somewhere over in Georgia.

211
00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:25.249
Buddy Threadgoode.

212
00:13:36.226 --> 00:13:37.640
Just come a little closer.

213
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.406
I want to give you something.

214
00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:41.022
<i>Come here.</i>

215
00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:46.678
Whoa!

216
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:55.337
<i>Come back here Mrs. Hat.
Where do you think you're going?</i>

217
00:13:57.798 --> 00:13:59.244
Woo-oo!

218
00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:00.673
I've got it.
Hold on, Ruth.

219
00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:02.408
Hold on, Little Bit.

220
00:14:06.649 --> 00:14:09.360
<i>It's just--
All right, I've got it.</i>

221
00:14:12.758 --> 00:14:14.196
Come here, you damn hat.

222
00:14:14.235 --> 00:14:15.618
Got it! Oh!

223
00:14:15.672 --> 00:14:17.149
<i>Oh, I meant to do that</i>

224
00:14:19.898 --> 00:14:21.846
I've got it!

225
00:14:23.093 --> 00:14:24.970
<i>Ta-da!</i>

226
00:14:26.527 --> 00:14:28.072
All right.

227
00:14:28.446 --> 00:14:29.486
Damn.

228
00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:30.814
Come on.

229
00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:41.171
Come on.
Get off.

230
00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:42.577
Get off.

231
00:14:42.755 --> 00:14:44.710
- Come on.
- Buddy!

232
00:14:45.053 --> 00:14:46.616
<i>- Buddy!</i>
- All right, don't you worry.

233
00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:48.421
<i>Buddy Threadgoode!</i>

234
00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:51.851
<i>Come on, Buddy!</i>

235
00:14:51.893 --> 00:14:53.780
<i>- Enough playing.</i>
- Get out of there.

236
00:14:55.219 --> 00:14:56.838
Get out of there.

237
00:14:57.268 --> 00:14:58.761
<i>Buddy Threadgoode!</i>

238
00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:00.252
<i>Buddy!</i>

239
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.065
<i>- Come on, Buddy!
- Buddy!</i>

240
00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:07.604
Buddy!

241
00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:10.201
<i>Buddy!</i>

242
00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:12.998
No!

243
00:15:14.013 --> 00:15:16.029
<i>Buddy!</i>

244
00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:18.880
<i>Buddy, no!</i>

245
00:15:18.928 --> 00:15:20.513
<i>No!</i>

246
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.279
<i>Buddy!</i>

247
00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:23.906
<i>- Let go of her.
- No!</i>

248
00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:25.703
Buddy!

249
00:15:25.805 --> 00:15:26.969
Let me go!

250
00:15:27.001 --> 00:15:28.110
No.

251
00:15:28.938 --> 00:15:30.156
<i>- What is it?</i>
- No!

252
00:15:30.211 --> 00:15:31.313
Buddy!

253
00:15:31.344 --> 00:15:32.516
- Idgie!
- Come on now.

254
00:15:32.547 --> 00:15:34.266
- We've got to get back to the house.
- Buddy!

255
00:15:34.305 --> 00:15:35.789
<i>- Do not go there.</i>
- No, Mama.

256
00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:38.305
<i>- Come on, Mama.
- Come on, we've got to go home.</i>

257
00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:39.680
Buddy!

258
00:15:39.727 --> 00:15:41.906
- Buddy!
<i>- You have to be strong. It's gonna be OK.</i>

259
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:44.938
Buddy!

260
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.953
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

261
00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:51.047
<i>Oh, it like to have killed us all.</i>

262
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:55.633
<i>But nary a one took it
as hard as Idgie.</i>

263
00:15:58.783 --> 00:16:02.658
<i>Everyone thought she'd die
right along with him.</i>

264
00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:21.818
<i>Night after night,</i>

265
00:16:21.865 --> 00:16:23.896
<i>she stayed by the river.</i>

266
00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:28.622
<i>Big George was the only soul
she'd let near her, and...</i>

267
00:16:28.716 --> 00:16:31.381
<i>he watched over her
night and day.</i>

268
00:16:32.506 --> 00:16:34.865
<i>You know,
a heart can be broken,</i>

269
00:16:34.904 --> 00:16:37.857
<i>but, it still keeps a-beating
just the same.</i>

270
00:16:38.046 --> 00:16:39.148
Oh, Miss Idgie.

271
00:16:39.188 --> 00:16:40.687
You'll have to keep this blanket on

272
00:16:40.727 --> 00:16:43.203
or you'll catch your death of cold,
you hear me now?

273
00:16:45.132 --> 00:16:47.304
- That's so sad.
- Uh-huh.

274
00:16:56.588 --> 00:16:58.307
Would you like one of these?

275
00:16:58.362 --> 00:16:59.393
Oh!

276
00:16:59.432 --> 00:17:00.713
Thank you, honey.

277
00:17:00.775 --> 00:17:02.292
Evelyn?

278
00:17:02.878 --> 00:17:04.885
Eve, honey,
we gotta get going.

279
00:17:04.932 --> 00:17:06.838
The Braves game's fixing to start.

280
00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:09.338
And you're gonna miss your... thing.

281
00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:11.112
Excuse me.

282
00:17:11.143 --> 00:17:13.140
That's my husband, Ed.

283
00:17:13.178 --> 00:17:14.315
Hi, ma'am.

284
00:17:14.362 --> 00:17:15.581
How you doing?

285
00:17:15.627 --> 00:17:17.081
Um...

286
00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:20.861
I can't believe Buddy died.

287
00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:22.650
Neither could I.

288
00:17:24.322 --> 00:17:25.760
Oh, well...

289
00:17:25.791 --> 00:17:27.947
I enjoyed talking to you, honey.

290
00:17:28.009 --> 00:17:29.080
What's your name?

291
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:30.181
Um, Evelyn.

292
00:17:30.213 --> 00:17:31.869
Evelyn Couch.

293
00:17:32.056 --> 00:17:33.698
I've got to go.

294
00:17:33.744 --> 00:17:36.244
You come back and see me,
you hear?

295
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.744
Okay.

296
00:17:38.815 --> 00:17:40.290
Bye-bye.

297
00:17:40.824 --> 00:17:45.774
Well, first of all, I want you
to truly dedicate yourselves

298
00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:50.004
<i>to finding little ways
to putting that magic that sparks</i>

299
00:17:50.043 --> 00:17:52.114
back into your marriage.

300
00:17:52.235 --> 00:17:55.373
When we think
of romance and marriage,

301
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.553
what is the first thought
that comes into your mind?

302
00:17:58.631 --> 00:18:00.186
Divorce.

303
00:18:00.358 --> 00:18:03.930
Remember when marriage counselors used
to tell you to wrap yourself in cellophane

304
00:18:03.969 --> 00:18:06.225
to put a little charge into your marriage?

305
00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:08.381
Do we really pay for these lectures?

306
00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.983
<i>So you can see,
it is truly up to you...</i>

307
00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:16.297
<i>to put romance back
into your relationship.</i>

308
00:18:22.533 --> 00:18:26.449
âª <i>Oh, yeah</i> âª

309
00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:33.687
âª <i>As I walk this land of broken dreams</i> âª

310
00:18:33.757 --> 00:18:38.539

âª <i>- Happiness is just an illusion</i> âª
- Hi, honey.

312
00:18:43.065 --> 00:18:44.791
Evelyn, have you gone insane?

313
00:18:44.838 --> 00:18:46.939
My God, people can see you!

314
00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:49.533
What if I'd have been
the paperboy or something, honey?

315
00:18:49.588 --> 00:18:51.541
Get, get in there.

316
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:54.135
What are you thinking about?

317
00:18:55.398 --> 00:18:56.963
<i>Evelyn.</i>

318
00:18:58.986 --> 00:19:00.814
- Evelyn!
- Oh.

319
00:19:00.885 --> 00:19:01.947
You know?

320
00:19:02.002 --> 00:19:04.784
What we really need,
instead of this baloney,

321
00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:08.705
is an assertiveness training class
for southern women.

322
00:19:08.822 --> 00:19:12.158
But, that's a contradiction
in terms, isn't it?

323
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:14.002
Especially you, sweetheart.

324
00:19:14.027 --> 00:19:16.127
You're living in the Dark Ages.

329
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.382
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

330
00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:41.743
Ah, I need one of those.

331
00:19:41.782 --> 00:19:43.384
Mmm, you smell good, too.

332
00:19:43.439 --> 00:19:45.453
- Thank you.
- I need one of these.

333
00:19:46.462 --> 00:19:49.025
- Oh, this looks good.
- Uh-huh.

334
00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:50.828
Yes, indeed.

Ed.

339
00:20:05.325 --> 00:20:07.676
Why don't you come in
and sit down at the table

340
00:20:07.708 --> 00:20:09.161
and have dinner with me?

341
00:20:09.186 --> 00:20:11.137
I'm sorry, honey.
The game's almost over.

342
00:20:11.169 --> 00:20:12.739
I just wanted to see a bit of it.

343
00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:13.880
Why are you so dressed up?

344
00:20:13.919 --> 00:20:15.302
Honey, don't get
in the way there.

345
00:20:15.335 --> 00:20:16.841
Just scoot over just a bit.

346
00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:22.459
Ed?

347
00:20:22.648 --> 00:20:25.601
If I'd answered the door
wearing only cellophane,

348
00:20:25.749 --> 00:20:28.485
would you still be watching
the baseball game?

349
00:20:29.243 --> 00:20:32.532
No, honey, I'd probably be
checking you into a loony bin.

350
00:20:58.717 --> 00:20:59.733
<i>Hi, sugar.</i>

351
00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:01.237
<i>- How's my little dumpling?</i>
- Trick or treat?

352
00:21:01.276 --> 00:21:02.279
<i>You're gonna throw</i>

353
00:21:02.304 --> 00:21:04.012
<i>- one of them hissy fits, are you?
- Happy Halloween! Oh, no.</i>

354
00:21:04.044 --> 00:21:06.463
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

355
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:08.915
- Oh, Lord.
<i>- You are meaner than a damn snake.</i>

356
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.809
I'm glad you're feeling better,
aunt Vesta.

357
00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:14.294
<i>- You need to get back in bed, honey.</i>
- Good thing your eyesight's failing.

358
00:21:24.784 --> 00:21:26.716
- Hey!
- Mmm. Oh.

359
00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.294
Hey.

360
00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:30.717
I was hoping you'd be here.

361
00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:33.232
My roommate, Mrs. Otis,
said I could stay

362
00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:34.747
and visit with her and her family,

363
00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:36.435
but I said, "Thank you kindly,

364
00:21:36.474 --> 00:21:39.138
but I think I might have
my own visitor."

365
00:21:39.177 --> 00:21:41.482
And here you are!

366
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.958
Well, now, sit down.

367
00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.646
- Thank you.
- And doughnuts to boot.

368
00:21:46.036 --> 00:21:48.005
- You can't beat that.
- Well...

369
00:21:48.091 --> 00:21:50.638
- Help yourself, Mrs. Threadgoode.
- Oh, thank you.

370
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.372
How's your friend?

371
00:21:52.504 --> 00:21:54.325
- Mrs. Otis?
- Mmm-hmm.

372
00:21:54.381 --> 00:21:56.122
Well, not so good.

373
00:21:56.154 --> 00:21:57.365
Oh.

374
00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.513
Looks like I won't be getting home
for quite a while, and I sure miss it.

375
00:22:03.599 --> 00:22:06.443
Funny what you miss
when you're away from home.

376
00:22:07.044 --> 00:22:09.205
I miss the smell of coffee.

377
00:22:09.257 --> 00:22:11.154
And bacon frying.

378
00:22:12.365 --> 00:22:13.756
Oh.

379
00:22:13.919 --> 00:22:16.857
What I wouldn't give for a plate
of fried green tomatoes

380
00:22:16.896 --> 00:22:19.373
like we used to have at the cafÃ©.

381
00:22:19.708 --> 00:22:21.138
Ooh...

382
00:22:26.102 --> 00:22:28.961
I never told you
about the cafÃ©, did I?

383
00:22:29.011 --> 00:22:30.297
No, ma'am.

384
00:22:30.352 --> 00:22:31.899
Oh, well...

385
00:22:31.973 --> 00:22:33.961
Now, let me back up a bit.

386
00:22:35.297 --> 00:22:36.759
<i>You see...</i>

387
00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:40.625
<i>Idgie never quite
got over losing Buddy.</i>

388
00:22:44.414 --> 00:22:46.625
<i>She hardly ever come home.</i>

389
00:22:46.961 --> 00:22:50.141
<i>Only Big George knew how to find her.</i>

390
00:22:50.547 --> 00:22:54.086
<i>She just didn't seem to care
about anything any more.</i>

391
00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:56.422
<i>And then one summer day...</i>

392
00:22:56.539 --> 00:22:58.485
<i>her mama sent for her.</i>

393
00:22:58.821 --> 00:23:00.165
<i>Like they say...</i>

394
00:23:00.235 --> 00:23:03.586
<i>God never shuts one door
without opening another.</i>

395
00:23:04.468 --> 00:23:05.868
<i>That was also the day</i>

396
00:23:05.899 --> 00:23:07.977
<i>- Idgie met Frank Bennett.</i>
- Mama!

397
00:23:08.176 --> 00:23:10.649
<i>The man whose murder
got her arrested.</i>

398
00:23:11.035 --> 00:23:13.000
Well, hello there, miss.

399
00:23:13.084 --> 00:23:15.000
And who might you be?

400
00:23:16.079 --> 00:23:17.493
Towanda to you.

401
00:23:17.524 --> 00:23:18.718
Who are you?

402
00:23:18.743 --> 00:23:22.633
Oh, Frank Bennett's the name,
Miss Towanda.

403
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.613
I must say, you are looking
mighty fine today.

404
00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:31.194
Are you a politician, or
does lying just run in your family?

405
00:23:33.968 --> 00:23:35.600
<i>Mama!</i>

406
00:23:36.935 --> 00:23:40.373
- Well, there you are!
- Well, it's about time, Idgie.

407
00:23:44.071 --> 00:23:46.646
If you don't look like
the Wild Man Of Borneo.

408
00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:49.170
- There you go.
- Well, thank you.

409
00:23:50.851 --> 00:23:52.005
Guess who's here.

410
00:23:52.044 --> 00:23:53.052
Who?

411
00:23:53.107 --> 00:23:55.693
Ruth. She's staying
with us this summer...

412
00:23:55.718 --> 00:23:59.427
and will be in charge of all the young
people's activities at the church.

413
00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:00.732
Is that why you wanted to see me?

414
00:24:00.757 --> 00:24:03.076
Well, we have so many
nice things planned.

415
00:24:03.138 --> 00:24:04.459
Ruth!

416
00:24:06.443 --> 00:24:08.614
<i>You remember my youngest child?</i>

417
00:24:08.673 --> 00:24:10.263
Of course, I do.

418
00:24:10.412 --> 00:24:12.232
Hi, Idgie.

419
00:24:13.569 --> 00:24:14.966
Hi.

420
00:24:20.643 --> 00:24:22.999
Maybe, this isn't such a good idea.

421
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.768
Oh, it's got to work.

422
00:24:26.252 --> 00:24:28.896
<i>Somebody's got to help her.
I can't.</i>

423
00:24:30.749 --> 00:24:33.372
Are you sure you wanna go
to this here River Club, Miss Ruth?

424
00:24:33.397 --> 00:24:35.119
These ain't no churchgoing folks,
you know?

425
00:24:35.158 --> 00:24:37.910
<i>I'll do just fine, George.
Thank you.</i>

426
00:24:40.143 --> 00:24:41.902
Oh, excuse me.

427
00:24:41.973 --> 00:24:44.668
Is um, Idgie Threadgoode here,
by any chance?

428
00:24:44.706 --> 00:24:46.730
Come on in, honey.
She's right down here.

429
00:24:46.769 --> 00:24:48.621
- Oh, here?
- Uh-huh.

430
00:24:48.652 --> 00:24:49.816
Oh.

431
00:24:51.416 --> 00:24:53.652
I'll see you, Grady Kilgore.

432
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:56.308
And I'll raise you 20.

433
00:24:56.504 --> 00:24:58.551
You ain't got nothing.

434
00:24:58.621 --> 00:25:01.558
Maybe I do and maybe I don't.

435
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.293
Put your money where
your mouth is, Mr. Sheriff.

436
00:25:10.148 --> 00:25:12.547
Well, look what the cat brung in.

437
00:25:12.873 --> 00:25:15.047
I came to talk to you.

438
00:25:16.947 --> 00:25:19.164
You're gonna have to wait.
I'm busy.

439
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:20.966
Come on, Grady.
This is your big chance.

440
00:25:20.998 --> 00:25:22.281
You in or out?

441
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.530
It'll make you a rich man.

442
00:25:24.617 --> 00:25:27.140
You're just bluffing again as usual.

443
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.029
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to excuse Idgie.

444
00:25:29.054 --> 00:25:30.211
- She's going home for dinner.
- Hey!

445
00:25:30.236 --> 00:25:31.239
- Nice meeting you.
- Where you going?

446
00:25:31.264 --> 00:25:33.289
- Say goodbye, Idgie.
- Excuse me.

447
00:25:34.105 --> 00:25:36.112
Where the hell are you going
with my money?

448
00:25:36.144 --> 00:25:37.839
We're going home.

449
00:25:38.112 --> 00:25:39.605
Who are you to boss me around?

450
00:25:39.636 --> 00:25:41.379
I'm the one holding your money,
that's who.

451
00:25:41.425 --> 00:25:42.839
Give it back.

452
00:25:43.055 --> 00:25:44.917
Now, get in the car.

453
00:25:47.042 --> 00:25:48.207
All right.

454
00:25:48.253 --> 00:25:49.878
I'll get in the car.

455
00:25:50.258 --> 00:25:51.901
You win.

456
00:25:52.939 --> 00:25:54.550
Come on.

457
00:25:55.809 --> 00:25:57.635
Sucker!

458
00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:00.042
I'll leave here when I want to.

459
00:26:00.096 --> 00:26:03.464
I just don't know how you can break
your mother's heart like you do.

460
00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:05.800
I'm not doing anything to my mother.

461
00:26:05.839 --> 00:26:06.706
- Oh, no?
- No.

462
00:26:06.721 --> 00:26:08.135
Why do you think
I'm over here for the summer?

463
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.518
Your mother was worried about you.

464
00:26:09.566 --> 00:26:12.206
She thought I might be able
to try to talk sense into you.

465
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.458
But you're too busy being selfish.

466
00:26:14.487 --> 00:26:16.388
What are you talking about?

467
00:26:17.341 --> 00:26:20.505
Idgie, you're not the only one
who lost Buddy.

468
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.536
We all...

469
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.842
miss him, but...

470
00:26:23.881 --> 00:26:27.091
turning your back on
your family is not gonna help.

471
00:26:28.602 --> 00:26:30.825
What's he got to do with anything?

472
00:26:31.493 --> 00:26:35.005
It looks like you're the one
with the problem forgetting my brother.

473
00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:41.991
<i>Why, just ten miles away,</i>

474
00:26:42.037 --> 00:26:43.313
<i>down by the river,</i>

475
00:26:43.344 --> 00:26:46.727
<i>there lurks a den of the devil!</i>

476
00:26:46.961 --> 00:26:48.358
<i>Where liquor...</i>

477
00:26:48.412 --> 00:26:49.982
<i>and gambling...</i>

478
00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:52.828
<i>and sin abide!</i>

479
00:26:53.135 --> 00:26:56.799
Snakes and serpents.

480
00:26:56.841 --> 00:26:58.799
<i>Hey, Scroggins!</i>

481
00:26:58.952 --> 00:27:01.575
You're finally preaching
about something you're kin to.

482
00:27:01.631 --> 00:27:02.708
Snakes.

483
00:27:04.554 --> 00:27:06.210
<i>As I said...</i>

484
00:27:06.312 --> 00:27:11.656
snakes and serpents take many disguises.

485
00:27:11.796 --> 00:27:15.265
<i>Let's turn to page 53 in our hymnal.</i>

486
00:27:21.427 --> 00:27:23.083
Yoo-hoo!

487
00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:27.521
Big George thought
I might find you here.

488
00:27:31.563 --> 00:27:33.930
If you give me a chance,

489
00:27:34.055 --> 00:27:36.321
a chance to get to know you,

490
00:27:36.399 --> 00:27:38.719
maybe it'll be fun.

491
00:27:40.346 --> 00:27:41.852
Fun?

492
00:27:43.657 --> 00:27:47.172
Idgie, just spend some time with me.

493
00:27:48.008 --> 00:27:49.188
Please.

494
00:27:49.235 --> 00:27:50.899
Suit yourself.

495
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:54.186
Are you sure you don't
wanna back out now?

496
00:27:54.256 --> 00:27:56.429
- It's not too late.
- I'm sure.

497
00:27:57.741 --> 00:27:59.389
Here, hold this.

498
00:28:02.272 --> 00:28:04.475
Tell me, now,
you like trains?

499
00:28:04.542 --> 00:28:05.982
Yes.

500
00:28:06.065 --> 00:28:07.467
Good.

501
00:28:08.654 --> 00:28:11.912
We'll get along just fine.

502
00:28:14.076 --> 00:28:16.487
Boy, did we luck out tonight.

503
00:28:20.363 --> 00:28:21.865
Hop in.

504
00:28:22.705 --> 00:28:24.092
Hop?

505
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.455
Oh.

506
00:28:26.494 --> 00:28:28.033
Give me your hand.

507
00:28:28.185 --> 00:28:30.240
Just put your foot up there.

508
00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:42.121
Hold this.

509
00:28:44.579 --> 00:28:46.383
Look at all this.

510
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.995
Don't you think
we should get off the train?

511
00:28:53.112 --> 00:28:54.511
It's starting to move.

512
00:28:54.558 --> 00:28:56.777
No.
The fun just started.

513
00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:03.148
You all right?

514
00:29:03.853 --> 00:29:07.672
Well, sometimes I get
a little dizzy looking down.

515
00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.094
Don't look down.

516
00:29:23.836 --> 00:29:25.723
What are you doing?

517
00:29:25.989 --> 00:29:27.512
Come on. Look.

518
00:29:27.675 --> 00:29:29.410
They're throwing away food!

519
00:29:29.473 --> 00:29:30.958
- Where?
- Food!

520
00:29:35.362 --> 00:29:37.129
You talk about "give unto others".

521
00:29:37.168 --> 00:29:39.781
Yes, but this food isn't yours to give.

522
00:29:40.072 --> 00:29:42.077
That's church talk.

523
00:29:42.383 --> 00:29:45.412
I've seen those same people
over at church on Sunday...

524
00:29:45.484 --> 00:29:48.062
over at the River Club
every other night of the week,

525
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.351
doing anything but pray.

526
00:29:50.556 --> 00:29:51.923
Come on.

527
00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:02.435
<i>- Give me.
- More!</i>

528
00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:05.068
<i>- Over here.
- More!</i>

529
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.163
<i>More, more!</i>

530
00:30:08.217 --> 00:30:09.592
<i>- Whoa!
- Let me go there.</i>

531
00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:10.655
<i>More!</i>

532
00:30:10.718 --> 00:30:12.374
<i>Thank you.
- Get some more!</i>

533
00:30:21.038 --> 00:30:22.756
<i>- Give them back.
- No.</i>

534
00:30:34.886 --> 00:30:36.401
Okay.

535
00:30:36.433 --> 00:30:38.089
Time to get off.

536
00:30:38.979 --> 00:30:40.691
We gotta jump.

537
00:30:42.339 --> 00:30:43.573
Jump?

538
00:30:43.605 --> 00:30:44.612
Yeah, jump.

539
00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:46.987
The next stop is five miles
down the tracks.

540
00:30:47.081 --> 00:30:49.363
I don't wanna walk that far back.

541
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.005
Are you crazy?

542
00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:54.896
<i>You're not kidding.</i>

543
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.146
Well...

544
00:30:57.612 --> 00:30:59.302
I give up.

545
00:30:59.349 --> 00:31:00.521
Jump.

546
00:31:00.575 --> 00:31:03.450
I'll tell Mama I'm not
a good influence on you--

547
00:31:03.481 --> 00:31:05.708
You'll never jump, will you?

548
00:31:08.672 --> 00:31:10.805
Don't say "never" to me.

549
00:31:21.151 --> 00:31:22.674
Oh!

550
00:31:23.313 --> 00:31:25.151
Towanda!

551
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.580
Ow!

552
00:31:39.327 --> 00:31:40.666
Are you all right?

553
00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:42.391
I'm fine.

554
00:31:43.187 --> 00:31:44.891
I'm all right.

555
00:31:45.189 --> 00:31:46.461
Ow!

556
00:31:47.918 --> 00:31:49.789
- Does this hurt?
- Ouch!

557
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:51.211
I guess so.

558
00:31:52.778 --> 00:31:54.486
- We better get you to a doc...
- Shit!

559
00:31:54.554 --> 00:31:56.799
doctor.
Which way is it?

560
00:31:57.283 --> 00:32:00.369
About two miles down the tracks.

561
00:32:00.892 --> 00:32:02.017
All right.

562
00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:03.392
Let's go.

563
00:32:04.931 --> 00:32:07.970
You'll never be able
to carry me that far.

564
00:32:08.458 --> 00:32:11.033
I know.
Never say never.

565
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.955
I'm not carrying you.

566
00:32:13.025 --> 00:32:14.681
We're walking.

567
00:32:21.499 --> 00:32:23.069
<i>Thank you, Julian.</i>

568
00:32:23.105 --> 00:32:24.959
<i>I owe you one.</i>

569
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.732
Oh.

570
00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.616
Ah.

571
00:32:39.678 --> 00:32:41.178
Ow!

572
00:32:41.982 --> 00:32:43.544
Aren't you ready yet?

573
00:32:43.591 --> 00:32:44.943
What?

574
00:32:47.997 --> 00:32:51.419
This doesn't have anything
to do with trains, does it?

575
00:32:53.021 --> 00:32:55.747
- You like honey?
- Oh, yeah, I like honey.

576
00:32:55.839 --> 00:32:57.591
- Fresh honey?
- Yeah.

577
00:32:57.681 --> 00:32:59.013
Me too.

578
00:33:00.692 --> 00:33:02.233
There it is.

579
00:33:03.299 --> 00:33:05.420
There what is?

580
00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:08.788
<i>You'll see...</i>

581
00:33:08.881 --> 00:33:10.389
<i>Soon enough.</i>

582
00:33:14.031 --> 00:33:15.265
Now...

583
00:33:15.296 --> 00:33:16.320
stay here.

584
00:33:16.345 --> 00:33:18.646
No matter what happens,
don't move.

585
00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:21.794
What are you gonna do?

586
00:33:58.109 --> 00:33:59.569
Ah.

587
00:34:13.769 --> 00:34:15.207
Mmm.

588
00:34:22.764 --> 00:34:24.139
Mmm.

589
00:34:35.103 --> 00:34:37.650
Here you are, madame.
This is for you.

590
00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:39.928
Wh... Why did you do that?

591
00:34:39.996 --> 00:34:42.131
You could have been killed.

592
00:34:42.463 --> 00:34:44.377
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:46.249 --> 00:34:48.225
Don't you want the honey?

594
00:34:48.688 --> 00:34:50.631
I got it just for you.

595
00:34:52.217 --> 00:34:54.279
It's all right.
I do it all the time.

596
00:34:54.311 --> 00:34:56.616
I never get stung, honest.

597
00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:00.907
Don't be mad at me, Ruth.

598
00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:04.305
Idgie, I'm not mad at you.

599
00:35:04.863 --> 00:35:06.665
No fooling?

600
00:35:15.602 --> 00:35:17.192
Is it bad, what I did?

601
00:35:17.253 --> 00:35:18.768
No.

602
00:35:19.213 --> 00:35:21.854
Thought I might be crazy or something?

603
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.792
No, no.

604
00:35:24.104 --> 00:35:26.385
No, I've heard there were people...

605
00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:27.963
who could charm bees.

606
00:35:27.995 --> 00:35:30.112
I've just never seen it done...

607
00:35:30.191 --> 00:35:31.886
before today.

608
00:35:34.409 --> 00:35:37.643
You're just a bee charmer,
Idgie Threadgoode.

609
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.604
That's what you are.

610
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.479
A bee charmer.

611
00:35:42.387 --> 00:35:44.596
Here, you want to taste it?

612
00:35:50.652 --> 00:35:53.896
"Satan started to laugh at Job's devotion.

613
00:35:53.974 --> 00:35:55.255
"He bet...

614
00:35:55.294 --> 00:35:56.302
"God...

615
00:35:56.349 --> 00:35:58.865
"that Job would never
have so much faith

616
00:35:58.906 --> 00:36:01.007
"if he didn't have so many blessings.

617
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:04.078
"And he went on and on
so long and so much...

618
00:36:04.149 --> 00:36:08.141
"that God finally agreed
to let Satan put Job to a test.

619
00:36:08.258 --> 00:36:09.492
"And suddenly,

620
00:36:09.524 --> 00:36:11.422
"from being on top of the world,

621
00:36:11.476 --> 00:36:15.140
Job was plunged down into
the deepest pits of misery."

622
00:36:16.858 --> 00:36:19.329
Surprise!

623
00:36:22.805 --> 00:36:24.071
Idgie Threadgoode!

624
00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:25.716
Now tonight, we're gonna
have a real party.

625
00:36:25.741 --> 00:36:28.446
Drink this and then
we're gonna play some poker.

626
00:36:28.508 --> 00:36:29.743
Well, I don't...

627
00:36:29.798 --> 00:36:32.774
I don't know how to play poker
and I never drink, but...

628
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:34.196
thank you anyway.

629
00:36:34.229 --> 00:36:35.464
<i>We're not weaseling that out.</i>

630
00:36:35.495 --> 00:36:37.548
âª <i>- Oh, my darling' âª
- Taking it in here.</i>

631
00:36:37.587 --> 00:36:40.016
âª <i>- Oh, my darling'</i> âª
- Here comes the windup now.

632
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.626
- Here comes the windup.
- Oh.

633
00:36:41.675 --> 00:36:43.776
Burn that ball in here.
Burn 'em in here.

634
00:36:43.815 --> 00:36:45.167
- Burn 'em in here.
- Throw that ball.

635
00:36:45.192 --> 00:36:46.807
Right in the pocket.
Right in the pocket.

636
00:36:46.839 --> 00:36:49.518
I... I don't know how to bat.

637
00:36:49.573 --> 00:36:51.667
- Yeah, and you don't drink either.
- All right now.

638
00:36:51.706 --> 00:36:53.104
- Come on, buddy.
- Come on.

639
00:36:53.129 --> 00:36:54.151
Gonna be a spitter.

640
00:36:54.176 --> 00:36:55.392
<i>- Hold the bat and swing.</i>
- Gonna be a spitter.

641
00:36:55.417 --> 00:36:57.003
- I'll pitch it easy to you.
- Spitter?

642
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.300
<i>She gonna spit at me?
- Don't be a chant, you hear?</i>

643
00:36:58.331 --> 00:37:00.167
<i>- No, she gonna spit on the ball.
- Wait a minute!</i>

644
00:37:00.206 --> 00:37:01.987
- Swing that bat.
- Oh, that's all right.

645
00:37:02.018 --> 00:37:03.768
- Take another crack at it.
- All right.

646
00:37:03.831 --> 00:37:05.784
<i>Take another crack at it.</i>

647
00:37:05.862 --> 00:37:07.206
Get 'em in here.
Get 'em in here.

648
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:09.034
Get 'em in.
Come on.

649
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.292
Yeah!

650
00:37:10.331 --> 00:37:12.542
Wooh! Wooh!

651
00:37:12.597 --> 00:37:15.769
- Wooh! Wooh! Wooh! Wooh! Wooh!
- My God, you are--

652
00:37:15.839 --> 00:37:18.018
- Wooh! Wooh, wooh, wooh!
- You've got to run.

653
00:37:18.066 --> 00:37:19.370
Run, run, run.

654
00:37:19.421 --> 00:37:21.034
Come on, run around the bases!.

655
00:37:21.073 --> 00:37:23.456
Don't kiss everybody! Run!

656
00:37:24.122 --> 00:37:28.661
I have never had so much fun
in my whole life.

657
00:37:28.716 --> 00:37:32.005
And I even got a home run.

658
00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.200
A clean one at that.

659
00:37:35.223 --> 00:37:37.528
A straight beats three of a kind.

660
00:37:43.534 --> 00:37:45.895
You know, poker isn't half bad.

661
00:37:47.317 --> 00:37:51.091
Oh, Idgie, what's your mother
gonna say when she sees us both...

662
00:37:51.427 --> 00:37:52.653
drunk?

663
00:37:53.935 --> 00:37:56.458
You've got to stop worrying
about what people think.

664
00:37:56.489 --> 00:37:57.558
I know.

665
00:37:57.599 --> 00:37:59.708
I mean, you've always
done the right thing.

666
00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:02.966
You took care of your daddy,
the preacher, when he took sick.

667
00:38:03.036 --> 00:38:06.130
You take care of all of the kids
over at the church school.

668
00:38:06.224 --> 00:38:09.239
You're gonna take care of your mama.

669
00:38:09.801 --> 00:38:12.974
I know, and I'm gonna marry
the man I'm supposed to.

670
00:38:13.567 --> 00:38:15.458
You're getting married?

671
00:38:15.534 --> 00:38:17.692
As soon as the summer's over.

672
00:38:23.418 --> 00:38:25.785
Oh, am I gonna miss you.

673
00:38:27.231 --> 00:38:29.973
This is the best birthday...

674
00:38:30.547 --> 00:38:32.516
I ever had.

675
00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.227
<i>Ruth invited Idgie to the wedding.</i>

676
00:38:49.652 --> 00:38:51.922
<i>but Idgie never did write back.</i>

677
00:38:52.227 --> 00:38:53.266
<i>No.</i>

678
00:38:53.313 --> 00:38:56.508
<i>But, she did drive all night
to Valdosta, Georgia,</i>

679
00:38:56.533 --> 00:38:58.172
<i>to watch from afar.</i>

680
00:38:58.289 --> 00:39:00.289
Whoa!
Here we go!

681
00:39:01.985 --> 00:39:05.493
<i>And then she swore
she'd never see Ruth again.</i>

682
00:39:05.688 --> 00:39:07.337
<i>- No, siree.
- I know.</i>

683
00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:09.048
<i>Whoa!</i>

684
00:39:09.875 --> 00:39:12.727
Now, now, Mama Jamison,
you put that down right now.

685
00:39:12.797 --> 00:39:14.430
No, no, no.

686
00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:17.032
Oh, my Lord!
Frank, I love you.

687
00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:23.634
<i>So, during these next few weeks,...</i>

688
00:39:23.691 --> 00:39:26.807
<i>we will be learning to reclaim...</i>

689
00:39:26.861 --> 00:39:29.119
<i>our own power as women.</i>

690
00:39:29.166 --> 00:39:30.736
Hallelujah!

691
00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.814
And tonight,...

692
00:39:33.019 --> 00:39:37.610
we're gonna begin to explore
our own femaleness...

693
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:40.618
by examining the source...

694
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.704
of our strength...

695
00:39:43.233 --> 00:39:45.375
and our separateness.

696
00:39:46.062 --> 00:39:47.914
Our vaginas.

697
00:39:49.853 --> 00:39:52.509
So, if you all will just slip off
your panties now

698
00:39:52.559 --> 00:39:54.470
and straddle your mirrors.

699
00:39:56.203 --> 00:39:58.579
<i>- Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>- Miss Couch.</i>

700
00:39:58.801 --> 00:40:00.470
Miss Couch!

701
00:40:02.391 --> 00:40:03.461
Um...

702
00:40:03.516 --> 00:40:05.945
I need to be excused for a minute.

703
00:40:05.976 --> 00:40:07.000
Um...

704
00:40:07.039 --> 00:40:10.351
Missy, could you come with me
to the ladies' room?

705
00:40:10.398 --> 00:40:12.354
Do you find this threatening?

706
00:40:12.406 --> 00:40:14.351
Uh, well, um...

707
00:40:14.391 --> 00:40:17.101
Do you have a problem
with your sexuality?

708
00:40:17.133 --> 00:40:19.047
No, ma'am. But um...

709
00:40:19.101 --> 00:40:21.562
I do have a problem
with my girdle.

710
00:40:33.854 --> 00:40:35.737
âª <i>Cherish is the word</i> âª

711
00:40:35.807 --> 00:40:40.239
âª <i>I use to describe</i> âª

712
00:40:42.234 --> 00:40:44.403
âª <i>All the feelings that I have</i> âª

713
00:40:44.457 --> 00:40:45.911
Hi, baby.

714
00:40:46.008 --> 00:40:47.942
All right, fried chicken!

715
00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:49.567
My favourite.

716
00:40:51.418 --> 00:40:55.801
âª <i>I don't know how many times âª
âª I wish that I had told you</i> âª

717
00:40:55.869 --> 00:40:57.574
Ed!

718
00:40:59.474 --> 00:41:00.873
Ed...

719
00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:05.214
Those classes I've been taking forever
aren't helping us one bit.

720
00:41:05.433 --> 00:41:07.683
Let's go to Florida...

721
00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:10.277
like when we got married.

722
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:12.089
Kyle's gone.

723
00:41:12.129 --> 00:41:13.832
Busy with his own life.

724
00:41:13.981 --> 00:41:15.879
It'd be just the two of us.

725
00:41:15.949 --> 00:41:18.480
Well, honey, it's just
the two of us here now.

726
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.199
Boy, you got a good scald
on that chicken.

727
00:41:21.238 --> 00:41:23.379
Mmm, I'm telling you,
it's really good.

728
00:41:23.426 --> 00:41:24.879
Thank you.

729
00:41:24.941 --> 00:41:29.996
We could rent a boat
and drift around in the hot sun.

730
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:32.589
What do you think about it?

731
00:41:32.804 --> 00:41:35.573
Well, I'm just getting used to it
being quiet around here.

732
00:41:35.808 --> 00:41:37.167
Honey...

733
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:38.229
if those classes...

734
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.917
aren't doing you any good, then

735
00:41:40.026 --> 00:41:41.573
don't go to them.

736
00:41:42.581 --> 00:41:45.245
<i>Everyone needs a miracle in their life.</i>

737
00:41:45.323 --> 00:41:46.643
Damn.

738
00:41:46.752 --> 00:41:48.237
The game's blacked out.

739
00:41:48.276 --> 00:41:50.214
<i>To change the ordinary.</i>

740
00:41:58.167 --> 00:41:59.534
Oo-hoo!

741
00:41:59.581 --> 00:42:00.929
Mrs. Threadgoode?

742
00:42:00.961 --> 00:42:02.478
Hey, Evelyn.

743
00:42:03.744 --> 00:42:05.385
Do you like it?

744
00:42:06.132 --> 00:42:07.947
Oooh!

745
00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.034
Well, uh, who did it for you,
darling?

746
00:42:11.073 --> 00:42:12.378
Well, believe it or not,

747
00:42:12.403 --> 00:42:13.448
it was a student.

748
00:42:13.487 --> 00:42:15.448
A little bitty thing,
no bigger than a midget,

749
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.135
from the beauty college.

750
00:42:18.057 --> 00:42:21.441
Sometimes, they come out here
and do our hair for free.

751
00:42:21.487 --> 00:42:23.698
Just for the practice,
you know?

752
00:42:24.245 --> 00:42:25.948
Is Ed with you?

753
00:42:26.096 --> 00:42:27.417
Oh, um...

754
00:42:27.479 --> 00:42:28.846
No, ma'am.

755
00:42:28.932 --> 00:42:31.440
His aunt said she didn't want
visitors any more.

756
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.761
Especially us.

757
00:42:32.794 --> 00:42:34.268
It's a shame.

758
00:42:34.487 --> 00:42:36.698
I know he feels bad.

759
00:42:36.956 --> 00:42:38.448
But...

760
00:42:38.502 --> 00:42:40.792
Lord, if he'll talk to me about it.

761
00:42:44.987 --> 00:42:46.964
Oh, thank you!

762
00:42:47.042 --> 00:42:48.323
Merry Christmas.

763
00:42:48.378 --> 00:42:50.042
Merry Christmas.

764
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.464
Mrs. Threadgoode?

765
00:42:57.781 --> 00:43:00.297
How about telling me some more...

766
00:43:00.484 --> 00:43:01.867
about Idgie?

767
00:43:01.914 --> 00:43:04.156
Oh, well, now,
let me see.

768
00:43:04.338 --> 00:43:06.149
Where were we?

769
00:43:06.359 --> 00:43:09.453
Ruth had just gotten married
to, to Frank Bennett?

770
00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:12.203
Wasn't that the man
Idgie was arrested for murdering?

771
00:43:12.244 --> 00:43:13.736
That's right.

772
00:43:15.327 --> 00:43:17.431
After Ruth left,...

773
00:43:17.522 --> 00:43:20.728
Idgie just went back
to her old ways.

774
00:43:21.277 --> 00:43:24.908
<i>Hanging out with Grady
and the boys at the River Club.</i>

775
00:43:25.431 --> 00:43:27.408
<i>But after a few years,...</i>

776
00:43:27.463 --> 00:43:30.330
<i>temptation got the better of her.</i>

777
00:43:34.449 --> 00:43:36.160
I don't wanna wake you, Miss Idgie.

778
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.090
But, it's an all-day drive to Valdosta.

779
00:43:38.121 --> 00:43:39.395
Your mama said if you're going,

780
00:43:39.434 --> 00:43:41.286
she wants you to take
this pie to Miss Ruth.

781
00:43:41.348 --> 00:43:43.160
Oh, how does she know
where I'm going?

782
00:43:43.215 --> 00:43:46.278
She knows because I told her.

783
00:43:46.372 --> 00:43:49.590
Don't you go stirring up
no trouble for Miss Ruth now.

784
00:43:49.629 --> 00:43:50.817
Yes, ma'am.

785
00:43:50.856 --> 00:43:52.169
Don't "yes, ma'am" me.

786
00:43:52.199 --> 00:43:54.256
Now you can stay in my house
as long as you want to,

787
00:43:54.287 --> 00:43:56.467
but don't you try to treat me
like you treat your mama.

788
00:43:56.514 --> 00:43:58.326
- Grandma!
- Yes, ma'am.

789
00:44:27.784 --> 00:44:28.806
Hi there.

790
00:44:28.841 --> 00:44:29.892
Yes?

791
00:44:29.997 --> 00:44:32.462
Uh, is Ruth at home?

792
00:44:32.967 --> 00:44:34.567
Who's calling?

793
00:44:34.661 --> 00:44:35.817
Um...

794
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.429
You just tell her it's the...

795
00:44:37.484 --> 00:44:39.765
bee charmer from Alabama.

796
00:44:40.434 --> 00:44:41.905
Ruth!

797
00:44:42.101 --> 00:44:45.312
There's some bee person
here to see you.

798
00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:00.659
Idgie?

799
00:45:00.746 --> 00:45:02.160
Hi.

800
00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:04.628
You've got a real nice home and...

801
00:45:04.674 --> 00:45:07.081
- real nice things and all.
- Mmm-mmm.

802
00:45:07.148 --> 00:45:08.636
Thank you.

803
00:45:09.149 --> 00:45:12.386
Oh, Mama said to give you this pie.

804
00:45:12.883 --> 00:45:14.456
So--

805
00:45:18.337 --> 00:45:20.059
Idgie Threadgoode.

806
00:45:20.396 --> 00:45:22.130
How are you?

807
00:45:22.712 --> 00:45:24.614
You look so...

808
00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:27.661
so grown-up.

809
00:45:29.179 --> 00:45:31.981
All the guys must be wild about you.

810
00:45:32.424 --> 00:45:33.941
Tell me...

811
00:45:34.421 --> 00:45:36.504
do you have a fella yet?

812
00:45:37.473 --> 00:45:38.786
Uh...

813
00:45:38.842 --> 00:45:40.458
a couple.

814
00:45:40.551 --> 00:45:42.786
I haven't decided on any.

815
00:45:42.908 --> 00:45:46.036
- Grady's the most persistent one.
- Grady Kilgore?

816
00:45:46.083 --> 00:45:47.715
Don't say it so loud.

817
00:45:47.756 --> 00:45:50.333
<i>Ruth, honey,
who's down there?</i>

818
00:45:52.226 --> 00:45:53.669
- Hey.
- Well--

819
00:45:53.716 --> 00:45:55.934
<i>- What happened to you?</i>
- Nothing.

820
00:45:56.226 --> 00:45:58.397
Nothing?
Where'd you get the shiner?

821
00:45:58.458 --> 00:46:00.106
- Well, I...
<i>- Who's down there?</i>

822
00:46:00.163 --> 00:46:02.114
Listen, I think you'd better leave now.

823
00:46:02.145 --> 00:46:03.848
- Did he hit you?
- No.

824
00:46:03.886 --> 00:46:05.856
- Did he beat you?
- Idgie.

825
00:46:05.935 --> 00:46:07.409
Somebody's got to talk to him.

826
00:46:07.434 --> 00:46:08.525
- Somebody's got to stand up to him.
- You're not gonna do anything.

827
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.894
- I'm going to kill him.
- No, no.

828
00:46:09.925 --> 00:46:11.846
I'm gonna have a little
conversation with him about...

829
00:46:11.886 --> 00:46:12.995
- You're not gonna do anything.
- picking on somebody...

830
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.456
- You understand me?
- his own size.

831
00:46:14.506 --> 00:46:16.927
You're not gonna do anything,
you understand?

832
00:46:17.066 --> 00:46:19.503
If you care about me,
if you really do,

833
00:46:19.558 --> 00:46:21.988
you'll turn around
and leave this minute.

834
00:46:22.039 --> 00:46:23.729
You understand?

835
00:46:36.446 --> 00:46:37.933
Well.

836
00:46:38.675 --> 00:46:40.355
What'd she want?

837
00:46:42.173 --> 00:46:43.683
Nothing.

838
00:46:56.242 --> 00:46:59.518
Ruth's a grown woman
and she knows what's best for her.

839
00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.033
Mmm.

840
00:47:01.088 --> 00:47:03.010
I'm not so sure about that.

841
00:47:04.302 --> 00:47:05.916
Idgie?

842
00:47:06.573 --> 00:47:08.275
Grady, hi.

843
00:47:08.335 --> 00:47:10.010
Idgie, will you dance with me?

844
00:47:10.043 --> 00:47:11.479
No!

845
00:47:11.939 --> 00:47:14.611
Oh, come on, Idgie.
It's only a dance.

846
00:47:18.547 --> 00:47:20.274
Miss Idgie Threadgoode...

847
00:47:20.299 --> 00:47:22.108
- Get your butt off the floor.
- will you...

848
00:47:22.133 --> 00:47:24.258
- Oh, my God.
- dance with me?

849
00:47:27.095 --> 00:47:28.911
I will not dance with you...

850
00:47:29.035 --> 00:47:31.130
and I will not marry you.

851
00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:35.231
Go marry Gladys Moats.
She just adores you.

852
00:47:35.285 --> 00:47:38.708
But, she did fall on her head
when she was just a child.

853
00:47:40.192 --> 00:47:43.841
You're just a goofy girl,
Idgie Threadgoode, a goofy girl.

854
00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:45.983
- Who are you calling a goof?
- Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

855
00:47:46.014 --> 00:47:48.069
- Who are you calling a goof?
- Now, now, you stop that

856
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:50.671
- before I get mad and hurt you.
- Oh, yeah? You try it.

857
00:47:50.717 --> 00:47:52.093
Whoa, oh, oh!

858
00:47:52.163 --> 00:47:53.436
Grady!

859
00:47:54.046 --> 00:47:56.764
- There, now. You give up?
- No! I'll never give up.

860
00:47:56.842 --> 00:48:00.624
<i>Grady finally got dizzy and gave up.</i>

861
00:48:01.513 --> 00:48:02.794
<i>Try as they might,</i>

862
00:48:02.834 --> 00:48:06.740
<i>none of them fellas at Eva's
River Club could tame Idgie.</i>

863
00:48:07.591 --> 00:48:08.623
<i>Now.</i>

864
00:48:08.664 --> 00:48:10.076
<i>A little while later,</i>

865
00:48:10.123 --> 00:48:12.326
<i>a letter come from Ruth.</i>

866
00:48:17.256 --> 00:48:18.671
Oh.

867
00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:20.843
It's an obituary.

868
00:48:20.913 --> 00:48:23.866
Oh, no, honey,
Ruth's mother died.

869
00:48:24.163 --> 00:48:25.562
Oh.

870
00:48:25.709 --> 00:48:28.116
And this is from the Bible.
It's...

871
00:48:28.207 --> 00:48:30.093
from the book of Ruth.

872
00:48:30.864 --> 00:48:32.812
And Ruth said...

873
00:48:33.754 --> 00:48:35.866
"Whither thou goest, I will go.

874
00:48:35.937 --> 00:48:38.203
"Where thou lodgest, I will lodge.

875
00:48:38.234 --> 00:48:40.640
Thy people shall be my people."

876
00:48:59.843 --> 00:49:01.054
All right Julian,

877
00:49:01.086 --> 00:49:03.445
you and Big George
wait out here for a minute.

878
00:49:15.457 --> 00:49:17.212
Mama died.

879
00:49:18.162 --> 00:49:19.744
I know.

880
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.525
And I'm pregnant.

881
00:49:42.885 --> 00:49:44.025
<i>Hey, Julian,</i>

882
00:49:44.072 --> 00:49:46.603
<i>I've got another box in here
when you're done.</i>

883
00:49:57.421 --> 00:49:59.789
I've never seen anybody
with so many hats.

884
00:49:59.829 --> 00:50:01.493
Why don't we put three in one box?

885
00:50:01.518 --> 00:50:03.945
I don't think we could fit
all these in the car.

886
00:50:04.685 --> 00:50:07.258
We're gonna need a separate
truck for all your stuff.

887
00:50:07.445 --> 00:50:09.758
What the hell is going on here?

888
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.164
Looks like your wife's
leaving you, mister.

889
00:50:12.266 --> 00:50:15.570
- Oh, sure she is.
- Hey, don't, don't you touch her!

890
00:50:15.703 --> 00:50:17.352
- Let go!
- Ow!

891
00:50:19.125 --> 00:50:20.453
Get off!

892
00:50:20.485 --> 00:50:22.070
That what hurt now!

893
00:50:22.133 --> 00:50:23.367
That's right!

894
00:50:23.406 --> 00:50:25.251
Whoa!

895
00:50:25.506 --> 00:50:26.783
Stop it!

896
00:50:26.814 --> 00:50:28.135
No!

897
00:50:28.166 --> 00:50:29.557
Ow!

898
00:50:29.914 --> 00:50:31.557
Don't you hurt her!

899
00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:33.228
Who's afraid!

900
00:50:38.283 --> 00:50:40.656
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, mister.

901
00:50:43.777 --> 00:50:47.426
See, the thing is,
you might upset Big George.

902
00:50:47.491 --> 00:50:48.762
And he's...

903
00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:50.036
crazy.

904
00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:52.473
There's no telling
what he might do.

905
00:51:15.918 --> 00:51:17.846
Go on, get out of here.

906
00:51:27.845 --> 00:51:29.681
Oh, oh!

907
00:51:29.732 --> 00:51:30.735
Hey!

908
00:51:30.777 --> 00:51:33.039
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

909
00:51:33.079 --> 00:51:34.430
Come on, now.
Come on, here.

910
00:51:34.455 --> 00:51:35.714
Let's go.
Come on.

911
00:51:36.496 --> 00:51:38.113
- Are you OK?
- Let's get Miss Ruth...

912
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:39.668
and get out of here.

913
00:51:40.198 --> 00:51:41.855
Come on, Miss Ruth.

914
00:51:41.976 --> 00:51:43.270
Come on.

915
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:45.723
- Come on.
- We're going.

916
00:51:45.816 --> 00:51:48.910
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you.

917
00:51:55.092 --> 00:51:58.100
Well, I sure as hell
scared him, didn't I?

918
00:51:58.807 --> 00:52:00.812
<i>Yeah, you sure scared him.</i>

919
00:52:00.874 --> 00:52:02.413
<i>Towanda!</i>

920
00:52:02.475 --> 00:52:04.436
<i>The amazing Amazon woman!</i>

921
00:52:04.475 --> 00:52:05.506
<i>Towanda?</i>

922
00:52:05.546 --> 00:52:07.444
<i>Towanda!</i>

923
00:52:07.474 --> 00:52:09.842
<i>Towanda!</i>

924
00:52:09.897 --> 00:52:11.562
<i>Oh, yeah, over here.</i>

925
00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:13.210
<i>Evelyn?</i>

926
00:52:14.038 --> 00:52:15.765
- Evelyn!
- Oh.

927
00:52:15.819 --> 00:52:16.835
I'm sorry.

928
00:52:16.878 --> 00:52:19.215
I was just looking
at the pictures, Missy.

929
00:52:19.254 --> 00:52:22.319
They have the greatest stories
in that magazine, don't they?

930
00:52:22.454 --> 00:52:24.686
Well, I'll see you in group tonight.

931
00:52:24.788 --> 00:52:27.077
We'll be talking about masturbation.

932
00:52:27.116 --> 00:52:28.312
Oh, well, no.

933
00:52:28.358 --> 00:52:29.491
I don't think so.

934
00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:33.003
I think I've had enough learning
for the time being, thank you.

935
00:52:33.251 --> 00:52:34.815
Thank you.

936
00:52:35.707 --> 00:52:36.964
Oh!

937
00:52:37.015 --> 00:52:38.652
Excuse me.

938
00:52:39.267 --> 00:52:40.987
Screw you!

939
00:52:43.992 --> 00:52:45.491
<i>Nothing.</i>

940
00:52:47.968 --> 00:52:50.038
Excuse me, young man!

941
00:52:50.148 --> 00:52:53.843
There was no reason for you
to be so rude to me back there.

942
00:52:53.944 --> 00:52:55.976
Get away from me,
you fat cow!

943
00:52:56.031 --> 00:52:57.530
What did you call me?

944
00:52:57.579 --> 00:52:59.585
Beat it, you old bitch.

945
00:53:00.119 --> 00:53:02.202
Why are you being so mean to me?

946
00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:04.866
What did I ever do to you?

947
00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.577
I don't understand!

948
00:53:18.414 --> 00:53:20.560
Look at my StoveTop!

949
00:53:26.909 --> 00:53:28.213
Boo!

950
00:53:29.807 --> 00:53:31.557
Oh, honey.

951
00:53:32.088 --> 00:53:34.323
What in the world is the matter?

952
00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:36.346
I don't know.

953
00:53:38.924 --> 00:53:40.424
Come on.

954
00:53:42.375 --> 00:53:45.070
Come on.
I need some exercise.

955
00:53:53.274 --> 00:53:54.665
Now...

956
00:53:54.717 --> 00:53:57.665
you tell me what's
bothering you, sugar.

957
00:53:59.541 --> 00:54:01.089
I just...

958
00:54:01.503 --> 00:54:04.003
I just feel so useless.

959
00:54:04.151 --> 00:54:05.628
So...

960
00:54:06.189 --> 00:54:07.768
So powerless.

961
00:54:07.807 --> 00:54:10.057
But, everybody goes through that.

962
00:54:10.104 --> 00:54:12.940
But, I can't stop eating.

963
00:54:13.122 --> 00:54:15.926
Every day, I try and try.

964
00:54:16.114 --> 00:54:18.661
And every day, I go off.

965
00:54:21.036 --> 00:54:23.825
I hide candy bars
all over the house.

966
00:54:23.864 --> 00:54:26.707
But, a candy bar ain't
gonna hurt you none.

967
00:54:27.258 --> 00:54:29.263
One, no, but...

968
00:54:29.402 --> 00:54:31.403
10 or 11?

969
00:54:32.966 --> 00:54:36.372
I can't even look at my own vagina.

970
00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:39.512
Well, now, honey,
I can't help you on that one.

971
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:42.091
I wish I had the courage to just

972
00:54:42.122 --> 00:54:44.934
get it over with
and get really fat.

973
00:54:48.017 --> 00:54:50.533
Oh, Mrs. Threadgoode,
I just...

974
00:54:52.713 --> 00:54:57.400
I'm too young to be old
and I'm too old to be young.

975
00:54:59.111 --> 00:55:01.908
Maybe, I'm just going crazy.

976
00:55:03.439 --> 00:55:05.830
Are you getting hot flashes?

977
00:55:07.166 --> 00:55:08.744
Sometimes.

978
00:55:08.825 --> 00:55:12.572
You get the sweats and
your heart starts a-pounding?

979
00:55:12.994 --> 00:55:14.088
How did you know?

980
00:55:14.128 --> 00:55:15.385
Simple, honey.

981
00:55:15.448 --> 00:55:17.814
You're going through the change.

982
00:55:20.302 --> 00:55:24.341
I used to burst into tears
for no reason at all.

983
00:55:25.294 --> 00:55:27.395
You need some hormones.

984
00:55:27.458 --> 00:55:31.310
Maybe, some of them Stresstabs No.4
for good measure.

985
00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:32.435
Really?

986
00:55:32.466 --> 00:55:33.568
Is that all?

987
00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:34.911
Sure, honey.

988
00:55:34.942 --> 00:55:37.192
You get yourself some hormones.

989
00:55:37.263 --> 00:55:41.239
And then you get out
of the house and get a job.

990
00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.716
Why, with your pretty complexion,

991
00:55:44.763 --> 00:55:48.489
I'll bet you'll be just
great with cosmetics.

992
00:55:49.685 --> 00:55:51.731
I know how you feel.

993
00:55:53.365 --> 00:55:56.756
I was about your age
when I had my child.

994
00:55:56.881 --> 00:55:59.248
Then I went through the change of life.

995
00:55:59.334 --> 00:56:02.990
- I didn't know you had a child.
- Oh, yes, I did.

996
00:56:04.247 --> 00:56:05.669
Albert.

997
00:56:07.205 --> 00:56:08.998
When he was born,
the doctor said

998
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.616
it would be best if
I didn't see him at all.

999
00:56:11.834 --> 00:56:15.904
He said his mind would never
develop past the age of five, and...

1000
00:56:16.006 --> 00:56:19.109
I should just put him
in an institution because

1001
00:56:19.156 --> 00:56:23.016
the burden of raising a child
like that would be too great.

1002
00:56:24.945 --> 00:56:26.398
Well...

1003
00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:29.703
I thought about Ruth.

1004
00:56:31.301 --> 00:56:33.320
She always said...

1005
00:56:33.663 --> 00:56:36.632
there was a separate God
for children.

1006
00:56:37.272 --> 00:56:41.650
So, I just smiled at him
and I, I asked for the baby.

1007
00:56:42.242 --> 00:56:43.523
Oh...

1008
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:45.476
How could anybody think that

1009
00:56:45.531 --> 00:56:48.999
sweet, precious baby
could ever be a burden?

1010
00:56:49.145 --> 00:56:53.562
Why, from the minute he was born,
Albert was the joy of my life.

1011
00:56:53.765 --> 00:56:56.460
The Lord's greatest gift.

1012
00:56:56.648 --> 00:57:00.781
I don't believe there was a purer soul
ever lived on this earth.

1013
00:57:01.434 --> 00:57:04.046
I had him with me till he was 30.

1014
00:57:04.421 --> 00:57:06.999
And then he went to sleep and...

1015
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:09.078
didn't wake up.

1016
00:57:10.184 --> 00:57:14.062
Sometimes, I can't wait to get
to heaven to see him again.

1017
00:57:16.607 --> 00:57:18.232
Yeah!

1018
00:57:18.372 --> 00:57:19.560
Shit!

1019
00:57:19.615 --> 00:57:20.747
It's a boy!

1020
00:57:20.802 --> 00:57:22.748
Ya-hoo!

1021
00:57:22.773 --> 00:57:23.966
Whoa, whoa!

1022
00:57:24.018 --> 00:57:27.700
I think a little prayer of thanksgiving
would be in order.

1023
00:57:27.739 --> 00:57:30.653
God damn it to hell,
son of a bitch, she did it!

1024
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:31.754
Here's to Ruth.

1025
00:57:31.785 --> 00:57:36.451
<i>Idgie always did have a way with words
around the Reverend Scroggins.</i>

1026
00:57:36.842 --> 00:57:37.864
<i>Well...</i>

1027
00:57:37.904 --> 00:57:39.607
<i>Ruth had a baby.</i>

1028
00:57:39.685 --> 00:57:41.764
<i>- She named him Buddy.</i>
- Be careful.

1029
00:57:41.818 --> 00:57:43.389
<i>Buddy Junior.</i>

1030
00:57:43.537 --> 00:57:48.209
<i>And Papa went and borrowed money,
so Ruth and Idgie Could start a CafÃ©.</i>

1031
00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:50.975
<i>The Whistle Stop CafÃ©.</i>

1032
00:57:55.258 --> 00:57:58.141
âª <i>When you come by my house</i> âª

1033
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.492
âª <i>Come down behind the jail</i> âª

1034
00:58:00.558 --> 00:58:02.978
âª <i>I've got a sign on my door</i> âª

1035
00:58:03.024 --> 00:58:05.440
âª <i>"Barbecue for sale"</i> âª

1036
00:58:05.478 --> 00:58:08.151
âª <i>I'm talking about barbecue</i> âª

1037
00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:12.096
âª <i>Only thing I crave</i> âª

1038
00:58:13.612 --> 00:58:16.877
âª <i>- And that good-doing' meat</i> âª
- Here, a room to stay.

1039
00:58:16.932 --> 00:58:20.955
âª <i>Will carry me to my grave</i> âª

1040
00:58:21.955 --> 00:58:24.752
âª <i>I'm selling' it for cheap</i> âª

1041
00:58:26.612 --> 00:58:29.260
- Miss Idgie, get the door for Papa.
âª <i>- And if you try one time</i> âª

1042
00:58:29.291 --> 00:58:31.682
âª <i>- Boy, you can't get enough</i> âª
- Papa.

1043
00:58:31.761 --> 00:58:33.020
Big George.

1044
00:58:33.067 --> 00:58:35.832
<i>Miss Ruth, me and the missus
sure do want to thank you for</i>

1045
00:58:35.869 --> 00:58:38.449
- sending that soup over for us last night.
- Mmm-hmm.

1046
00:58:38.474 --> 00:58:40.364
I'll, I'll pay you when I get ahead.

1047
00:58:40.403 --> 00:58:42.794
Oh, you don't owe me a thing, Ocie.

1048
00:58:42.843 --> 00:58:45.269
- Thank you, ma'am.
- I'm just glad they're better.

1049
00:58:45.499 --> 00:58:46.868
How is this, by the way?

1050
00:58:46.893 --> 00:58:48.751
- Oh, it's good.
- It's good. Very good, ma'am.

1051
00:58:48.782 --> 00:58:50.813
I'm not happy till
I see clean plates.

1052
00:58:56.191 --> 00:58:57.800
It can't go on, Idgie.

1053
00:58:57.894 --> 00:59:00.246
I'm talking to you
as a friend now, Idgie.

1054
00:59:00.292 --> 00:59:02.269
There are some people in this town,

1055
00:59:02.301 --> 00:59:03.808
they is paying customers too,

1056
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.949
- but I won't say who.
- Here you go, honey.

1057
00:59:06.107 --> 00:59:10.441
But, there are some people
don't like you selling to coloureds.

1058
00:59:10.777 --> 00:59:12.246
Here you go.

1059
00:59:12.326 --> 00:59:14.334
Well, listen, Grady.
I'll tell you what.

1060
00:59:14.381 --> 00:59:16.867
The next time those
"some people" come in here,

1061
00:59:16.906 --> 00:59:17.961
I'm gonna ask them

1062
00:59:17.986 --> 00:59:21.272
if they don't want anybody to know
who they are under those sheets they wear

1063
00:59:21.297 --> 00:59:25.687
when they go marching around in one
of those stupid parades you boys have.

1064
00:59:25.758 --> 00:59:28.711
How come they don't have enough
sense to change their shoes?

1065
00:59:28.741 --> 00:59:30.383
Now, you just hold on there, Idgie.

1066
00:59:30.422 --> 00:59:32.195
No, y'all ain't fooling anybody, Grady.

1067
00:59:32.227 --> 00:59:36.164
Why, I'd recognise those size 14
clodhoppers you got anywhere.

1068
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:37.836
Just a minute, now, Idgie.

1069
00:59:37.875 --> 00:59:39.820
Would you like
some more pie, Grady?

1070
00:59:39.866 --> 00:59:41.672
No, thank you, Ruth.

1071
00:59:41.742 --> 00:59:43.390
Psst. Idgie.

1072
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:45.422
I'll talk to the boys.

1073
00:59:45.547 --> 00:59:48.781
But, you just keep them
on out back there, you hear?

1074
00:59:48.969 --> 00:59:50.344
<i>Bye, Ruth.</i>

1075
00:59:50.417 --> 00:59:51.914
Bye, Grady.

1076
00:59:52.307 --> 00:59:54.930
Why, you're gonna get yourself
in a whole heap of trouble.

1077
00:59:54.955 --> 00:59:55.993
What?

1078
00:59:56.024 --> 00:59:58.140
Grady?
He's harmless.

1079
00:59:58.969 --> 01:00:02.875
Oh, you should have seen
that big ox down by the river.

1080
01:00:03.094 --> 01:00:05.573
Three solid days,
drunk as a dog,

1081
01:00:05.612 --> 01:00:07.184
crying like a baby.

1082
01:00:07.254 --> 01:00:09.926
Cos Joe, that old coloured man
that raised him, had died.

1083
01:00:09.965 --> 01:00:11.863
- Remember that, Sipsey?
- Yes'm.

1084
01:00:11.888 --> 01:00:14.045
But, he sure ain't joking now, is he, son?

1085
01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:14.756
No, ma'am.

1086
01:00:14.787 --> 01:00:17.084
He won't even sit in the same room
and have a meal today.

1087
01:00:17.137 --> 01:00:19.272
Oh, it don't make no kind of sense.

1088
01:00:19.319 --> 01:00:22.413
A big old ox like Grady won't
sit next to a coloured child,

1089
01:00:22.467 --> 01:00:23.779
but he eats eggs...

1090
01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:26.436
shoot right out of a chicken's ass.

1091
01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.364
âª <i>Now, some like it hot</i> âª

1092
01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:39.934
âª <i>And some like it cold</i> âª

1093
01:00:40.036 --> 01:00:44.231
âª <i>Some take it any way, âª
âª any way it's sold</i> âª

1094
01:00:44.292 --> 01:00:47.075
âª <i>I'm talking' 'bout barbecue</i> âª

1095
01:00:47.238 --> 01:00:50.529
âª <i>Only thing I crave</i> âª

1096
01:00:50.599 --> 01:00:52.825
Come on, Smokey.
Let's go for a walk.

1097
01:00:52.871 --> 01:00:55.709
âª <i>And that good-doing' meat</i> âª

1098
01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:59.600
âª <i>Going' to take me to my grave</i> âª

1099
01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.921
I'm sorry about spilling
my food in there, ma'am.

1100
01:01:04.978 --> 01:01:06.016
Um...

1101
01:01:06.055 --> 01:01:07.977
I'll just head on.

1102
01:01:17.357 --> 01:01:20.108
Do you see that piece of land over there?

1103
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.796
That...

1104
01:01:21.835 --> 01:01:23.170
That used to be a lake.

1105
01:01:23.219 --> 01:01:24.889
- No.
- Yeah.

1106
01:01:25.389 --> 01:01:27.585
And then this one November,...

1107
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.822
all these ducks come by...

1108
01:01:29.874 --> 01:01:31.986
and they landed on that lake.

1109
01:01:32.146 --> 01:01:36.634
Then the temperature dropped so fast,
the whole lake just froze.

1110
01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.662
Then the ducks took off
and took the lake with them.

1111
01:01:40.059 --> 01:01:42.420
Now that lake's somewhere over in Georgia.

1112
01:01:42.517 --> 01:01:44.943
<i>- That's the way I heard it.
- Go on, now.</i>

1113
01:01:59.937 --> 01:02:01.915
God bless you, ma'am.

1114
01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.987
âª <i>Cool down by</i> âª

1115
01:02:15.042 --> 01:02:16.729
âª <i>the river banks</i> âª

1116
01:02:16.792 --> 01:02:19.573
âª <i>Banks of Jordan</i> âª

1117
01:02:19.768 --> 01:02:23.120
âª <i>Cool down by</i> âª

1118
01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:26.942
âª <i>The banks of Jordan</i> âª

1119
01:02:27.261 --> 01:02:30.721
âª <i>Cool down by the river banks</i> âª

1120
01:02:30.774 --> 01:02:34.245
- Here, try this.
âª <i>- The banks of Jordan</i> âª

1121
01:02:36.893 --> 01:02:38.579
So what do you think?

1122
01:02:38.662 --> 01:02:40.401
They're OK.

1123
01:02:40.911 --> 01:02:42.294
The truth.

1124
01:02:42.368 --> 01:02:43.995
They're um...

1125
01:02:44.582 --> 01:02:46.027
They're...

1126
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.146
They're terrible!

1127
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.834
Oh, well.

1128
01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:55.169
Don't be shy.
Tell me how you feel.

1129
01:02:55.206 --> 01:02:56.849
I will.

1130
01:03:11.249 --> 01:03:13.267
What did you go and do that for?

1131
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:18.421
I just thought you needed
a little cooling off.

1132
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.360
You're right.

1133
01:03:36.008 --> 01:03:37.914
Try these.

1134
01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:45.573
I think we need to make a little paste.

1135
01:04:05.023 --> 01:04:07.664
What in the name of Christmas
are you two doing?

1136
01:04:07.704 --> 01:04:09.765
She's trying to teach me how to cook!

1137
01:04:09.802 --> 01:04:12.820
Look at those fried green tomatoes.

1138
01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:18.628
You'd better stop this,

1139
01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.988
or I'm gonna have to arrest you
for disorderly conduct.

1140
01:04:21.042 --> 01:04:22.878
Oh, arrest us, then.

1141
01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.948
- Let me handle this.
- All right.

1142
01:04:24.982 --> 01:04:26.495
Grady.

1143
01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:31.571
Arrest us.

1144
01:04:31.899 --> 01:04:33.282
Go ahead and arrest us.

1145
01:04:35.164 --> 01:04:37.196
Ruth, I have to say it.

1146
01:04:37.313 --> 01:04:39.563
I believe Idgie's been
a bad influence on you.

1147
01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:41.039
I agree.

1148
01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:46.252
âª <i> I-I-I</i> âª

1149
01:04:46.666 --> 01:04:49.262
âª <i> I-I-I</i> âª

1150
01:04:49.317 --> 01:04:52.333
âª <i>Don't wanna hear you weep no more</i> âª

1151
01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:54.151
âª <i>When I'm gone</i> âª

1152
01:04:54.197 --> 01:04:56.371
âª <i>Don't wanna hear you weep</i> âª

1153
01:04:56.403 --> 01:04:57.676
âª <i>When I'm gone</i> âª

1154
01:04:57.713 --> 01:04:59.197
âª <i> In my grave, Lord</i> âª

1155
01:04:59.234 --> 01:05:00.846
âª <i>In my grave</i> âª

1156
01:05:21.352 --> 01:05:23.212
I'll be back in a minute.

1157
01:05:24.235 --> 01:05:25.993
Y'all keep the show going till then.

1158
01:05:26.048 --> 01:05:27.798
We ain't going nowhere.

1159
01:05:29.734 --> 01:05:32.149
Down again.
Is she still poorly?

1160
01:05:32.901 --> 01:05:34.634
Where's the baby?

1161
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:36.446
Who are you?

1162
01:05:38.505 --> 01:05:40.415
What do you want?

1163
01:05:40.782 --> 01:05:42.337
Frank!

1164
01:05:45.563 --> 01:05:47.183
Get out of here.

1165
01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.011
Get on out of here!

1166
01:05:50.074 --> 01:05:51.871
Go on, get out of here
and leave us alone.

1167
01:05:51.921 --> 01:05:53.941
Come on, now, Ruth.

1168
01:05:54.143 --> 01:05:57.540
You wouldn't deny a father
the right to see his own son,...

1169
01:05:57.606 --> 01:05:59.896
- would you?
<i>- You git, I say.</i>

1170
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:01.860
Scat you!

1171
01:06:02.082 --> 01:06:03.098
Damn!

1172
01:06:03.138 --> 01:06:05.132
Gimme that.
Let it go!

1173
01:06:12.379 --> 01:06:13.843
Well.

1174
01:06:14.194 --> 01:06:16.062
That's my boy.

1175
01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:18.241
Isn't it?

1176
01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:25.422
<i>Is everything all right, ma'am?</i>

1177
01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:30.602
Our guest is just leaving.

1178
01:06:30.972 --> 01:06:33.344
<i>Come on, Frank, let's go.</i>

1179
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:38.782
I'll be back.

1180
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:43.063
In the end, you and the baby
are gonna be back.

1181
01:06:47.247 --> 01:06:48.882
I ain't scared of you.

1182
01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.281
No, sir.

1183
01:06:50.399 --> 01:06:51.993
You should be.

1184
01:07:03.431 --> 01:07:05.611
You mind your manners, boy!

1185
01:07:14.345 --> 01:07:16.094
Grady?

1186
01:07:16.946 --> 01:07:20.337
What does Gladys think
of you staying out late and...

1187
01:07:20.396 --> 01:07:24.048
losing all your money to me
in poker night after night?

1188
01:07:26.612 --> 01:07:28.404
She likes it just fine.

1189
01:07:32.881 --> 01:07:34.474
They've got Big George!

1190
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:35.560
Idgie!

1191
01:07:35.607 --> 01:07:38.459
- Let go of him!
- Idgie, you let me handle this, now.

1192
01:07:38.498 --> 01:07:41.717
We've seen how you treat your niggers
around here and we don't like it.

1193
01:07:41.774 --> 01:07:43.857
Well, I'm the law in these here parts.

1194
01:07:43.912 --> 01:07:47.045
And I really don't care
what you like or you don't like.

1195
01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:49.060
Now, you turn him loose.

1196
01:07:49.302 --> 01:07:52.201
Now, don't get all riled up,
nigger-lover.

1197
01:07:52.287 --> 01:07:54.209
Are you deaf or something?

1198
01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.123
I said let him go...

1199
01:07:56.233 --> 01:07:58.373
before you get yourselves
in a whole lot of trouble!

1200
01:07:58.405 --> 01:07:59.646
Calm, calm down.

1201
01:07:59.685 --> 01:08:01.834
We just wanted to have
a little get-together and

1202
01:08:01.881 --> 01:08:04.865
make sure we see
eye to eye on some things.

1203
01:08:05.095 --> 01:08:07.037
You hear me, now?

1204
01:08:08.703 --> 01:08:10.373
Let's let him go, boys.

1205
01:08:10.428 --> 01:08:12.280
We've had enough fun for one night.

1206
01:08:12.334 --> 01:08:13.888
All right, turn him loose.

1207
01:08:13.935 --> 01:08:15.506
- Come on.
- No, Miss Idgie.

1208
01:08:15.531 --> 01:08:17.381
- You're gonna get in trouble.
- Come on.

1209
01:08:19.006 --> 01:08:21.420
Well, now, that's more like it.

1210
01:08:21.825 --> 01:08:24.631
It seems I don't recognise
any of you boys.

1211
01:08:24.753 --> 01:08:27.678
Y'all ain't from Whistle Stop, are you?

1212
01:08:29.996 --> 01:08:31.785
This ought to do it.

1213
01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:34.660
I wanna to thank you, Miss Idgie.

1214
01:08:35.074 --> 01:08:36.863
Oh, forget it.

1215
01:08:37.043 --> 01:08:38.996
You'd have done the same for me.

1216
01:08:40.730 --> 01:08:42.496
Now, try to get some sleep.

1217
01:08:48.928 --> 01:08:50.998
Who the hell were those assholes?

1218
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:54.107
They's just some old boys from Georgia

1219
01:08:54.139 --> 01:08:56.936
come over here to put
a little scare in you.

1220
01:08:57.412 --> 01:08:59.185
Well, it worked.

1221
01:08:59.826 --> 01:09:02.576
One of 'em was over here
the other day for something, and...

1222
01:09:02.686 --> 01:09:05.180
seen you selling food to coloreds.

1223
01:09:05.321 --> 01:09:08.485
They decided to come back
to shake you up a little bit.

1224
01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:10.625
I told 'em...

1225
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.117
we don't need anybody from Georgia

1226
01:09:12.157 --> 01:09:14.992
coming over here telling us
what we can or cannot do.

1227
01:09:15.038 --> 01:09:19.226
They won't be back.
I guaran-gol-damn-tee you that.

1228
01:09:20.844 --> 01:09:24.063
One other thing,
little Miss Smarty-pants.

1229
01:09:24.946 --> 01:09:28.476
I do not wear a size 14 shoe.

1230
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.907
And I don't much care for parades,...

1231
01:09:32.024 --> 01:09:34.328
bedsheets or otherwise.

1232
01:09:47.849 --> 01:09:49.319
<i>Hey.</i>

1233
01:09:50.862 --> 01:09:52.342
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1234
01:09:52.514 --> 01:09:53.647
It was Frank.

1235
01:09:53.678 --> 01:09:55.482
He saw the baby.

1236
01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:58.983
<i>- Are you sure it was him?</i>
- Yes, I'm sure.

1237
01:09:59.256 --> 01:10:01.983
So that's why those Kluxers were here.

1238
01:10:02.146 --> 01:10:04.061
Let me take him.

1239
01:10:06.907 --> 01:10:08.487
Don't worry.
I mean...

1240
01:10:08.574 --> 01:10:10.034
if he's dumb enough...

1241
01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:14.050
to come back again, Grady and
the Alabama boys will take care of him.

1242
01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:16.136
And if they don't, I'll...

1243
01:10:16.339 --> 01:10:17.902
think of something.

1244
01:10:18.309 --> 01:10:20.315
Don't take any chances.

1245
01:10:20.589 --> 01:10:23.464
Promise me you won't
do anything crazy.

1246
01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:24.722
No matter what.

1247
01:10:24.764 --> 01:10:26.034
Me?

1248
01:10:26.383 --> 01:10:28.026
Not me.

1249
01:10:30.251 --> 01:10:32.313
I'm gonna put him down.

1250
01:10:33.818 --> 01:10:35.657
<i>Hey, little Buddy.</i>

1251
01:10:35.967 --> 01:10:39.118
<i>That was the last
anyone saw of Frank Bennett...</i>

1252
01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:41.353
<i>until the night of the town follies.</i>

1253
01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:45.930
<i>Ruth was away at one of
the Reverend Scroggins' many revivals.</i>

1254
01:10:45.993 --> 01:10:49.375
One thing a woman expects
when she gets married...

1255
01:10:49.406 --> 01:10:50.719
is sympathy.

1256
01:10:50.774 --> 01:10:53.479
Well, haven't you got that
since you married me?

1257
01:10:53.502 --> 01:10:54.852
I sure have...

1258
01:10:54.931 --> 01:10:56.946
from the whole town.

1259
01:11:28.934 --> 01:11:29.981
Hey there!

1260
01:11:30.027 --> 01:11:32.004
Miss Idgie,
you've got to come quick.

1261
01:11:32.207 --> 01:11:35.239
Well, the show's hardly begun.

1262
01:11:35.549 --> 01:11:37.512
You've got to come quick now.

1263
01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:38.778
You hear me?

1264
01:11:40.824 --> 01:11:42.309
Run now and get help!

1265
01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:43.628
- Where is the baby?
- Go get help, quick!

1266
01:11:43.659 --> 01:11:45.574
- Run!
- Never mind.

1267
01:12:05.641 --> 01:12:07.391
Excuse me, sir.

1268
01:12:07.766 --> 01:12:12.188
I don't believe you should be
going anywhere with Ruth's baby.

1269
01:12:58.389 --> 01:12:59.709
Thank you.

1270
01:12:59.763 --> 01:13:00.850
Hi there.

1271
01:13:00.888 --> 01:13:02.451
What can I do for you boys?

1272
01:13:02.484 --> 01:13:04.248
- Idgie.
- Grady.

1273
01:13:04.304 --> 01:13:06.990
This here is Sheriff Curtis Smoote.

1274
01:13:07.039 --> 01:13:08.974
- Hi there.
- He's over here from Georgia.

1275
01:13:09.005 --> 01:13:11.576
- Oh.
- And he's looking for a fella.

1276
01:13:13.768 --> 01:13:15.268
Do you recognise him?

1277
01:13:15.324 --> 01:13:17.354
- No.
- That's my husband.

1278
01:13:17.379 --> 01:13:19.908
But, I haven't seen him in months.

1279
01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:24.346
Well, I heard he got run over
by a Brinks armoured truck.

1280
01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.065
What's he done?

1281
01:13:26.119 --> 01:13:27.596
Nothing that we know of.

1282
01:13:27.643 --> 01:13:30.214
We're trying to find out
what's been did to him.

1283
01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:34.496
He told his hired man he was coming
over here to see his wife and baby, but...

1284
01:13:34.604 --> 01:13:37.299
he ain't never showed up back home.

1285
01:13:37.901 --> 01:13:41.963
Hell, I told him if he showed up
in this town, we'd all have known.

1286
01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:44.815
It looks a little sissified to me.

1287
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:46.533
From what I hear,

1288
01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:50.611
most of you boys over there in Georgia
are a little light on your feet.

1289
01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:53.127
That's the way I heard it.

1290
01:13:54.107 --> 01:13:56.213
Could I interest you in some pie?

1291
01:13:56.276 --> 01:13:57.440
No, ma'am.

1292
01:13:57.486 --> 01:14:00.111
But, that barbecue sure smells good.

1293
01:14:00.338 --> 01:14:04.026
Best damn barbecue
in the state of Alabama.

1294
01:14:32.894 --> 01:14:34.412
Here you go.

1295
01:14:34.592 --> 01:14:35.834
That's your fourth one today.

1296
01:14:35.874 --> 01:14:38.280
I swear you're about
to eat up all my barbecue.

1297
01:14:38.351 --> 01:14:39.928
Sit down.

1298
01:14:41.833 --> 01:14:43.295
Sit down.

1299
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:48.145
You ain't fooling me, girly girl.

1300
01:14:48.357 --> 01:14:50.474
I know who you are.

1301
01:14:51.072 --> 01:14:54.903
I heard from Bennett's hired hand that
you threatened to kill Frank Bennett.

1302
01:14:54.997 --> 01:14:57.700
Now, he ain't showed up dead yet.

1303
01:14:57.804 --> 01:15:00.083
But if he does, you're in
a whole mess of trouble.

1304
01:15:00.138 --> 01:15:01.778
You understand?

1305
01:15:02.521 --> 01:15:04.966
What we're talking about
is murder here.

1306
01:15:05.192 --> 01:15:08.544
Running afoul of the law, and
don't nobody get away with that,

1307
01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:11.796
not even a bunch of
Alabama smart alecks.

1308
01:15:12.648 --> 01:15:13.702
Now.

1309
01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:15.624
If I find so much as
a hair of his head,

1310
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:18.491
I'll arrest you faster than
you can slap a tick.

1311
01:15:18.991 --> 01:15:20.741
<i>Cos I'm the law.</i>

1312
01:15:20.839 --> 01:15:22.999
And you can't beat the law.

1313
01:15:43.988 --> 01:15:45.410
Hey there.

1314
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:48.972
Tell me what he said.

1315
01:15:49.090 --> 01:15:50.106
Who?

1316
01:15:50.153 --> 01:15:51.574
Smoote's?

1317
01:15:53.551 --> 01:15:55.106
I told you.
He said...

1318
01:15:55.153 --> 01:15:58.199
that was the best damn
barbecue he ever had.

1319
01:15:58.309 --> 01:15:59.863
That's all?

1320
01:16:00.324 --> 01:16:02.519
- No.
- What else?

1321
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:06.324
He said, pie was pretty good too.

1322
01:16:12.463 --> 01:16:15.002
You sure you ain't never
seen this man before?

1323
01:16:15.072 --> 01:16:16.931
Yes, sir.
I've already told you.

1324
01:16:16.987 --> 01:16:18.541
I ain't never seen him.

1325
01:16:18.783 --> 01:16:22.207
You'd do anything for Miss Idgie now,
wouldn't you, boy?

1326
01:16:24.155 --> 01:16:25.613
Yes, sir.

1327
01:16:28.391 --> 01:16:30.050
Would you kill for her?

1328
01:16:30.882 --> 01:16:32.727
Did you kill for her?

1329
01:16:40.226 --> 01:16:41.445
No, sir.

1330
01:16:42.171 --> 01:16:45.899
Well, now, maybe one of these days
you'll tell the truth.

1331
01:16:48.918 --> 01:16:51.490
Just remember, we hang
lying niggers in Georgia

1332
01:16:51.522 --> 01:16:54.264
just as fast as
they do in Alabama.

1333
01:16:55.227 --> 01:16:56.587
Yes, sir.

1334
01:16:56.692 --> 01:16:58.131
I remember.

1335
01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:06.532
âª <i>A God</i> âª

1336
01:17:07.325 --> 01:17:10.133

âª <i>And fit it for the sky</i> âª

1340
01:17:37.626 --> 01:17:39.079
Sorry.

1341
01:17:40.038 --> 01:17:42.149
What are you doing in here?

1342
01:17:42.345 --> 01:17:44.477
No milk in the house.

1343
01:17:45.297 --> 01:17:46.868
Where were you?

1344
01:17:46.923 --> 01:17:50.227
Taking care of business,
having a good time.

1345
01:17:52.966 --> 01:17:54.821
I've been thinking.

1346
01:17:55.812 --> 01:17:59.508
Maybe, I should move on,
because of Frank and all.

1347
01:18:00.857 --> 01:18:02.446
I just...

1348
01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:04.950
don't want you to feel like...

1349
01:18:05.167 --> 01:18:07.753
you have to look out for us.

1350
01:18:08.907 --> 01:18:10.365
<i>I just...<i>

1351
01:18:10.483 --> 01:18:12.188
don't want to be selfish,
that's all.

1352
01:18:12.219 --> 01:18:15.165
Maybe if I wasn't here,
you'd settle down.

1353
01:18:15.415 --> 01:18:18.352
I'm as settled as I ever hope to be.

1354
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.160
Then...

1355
01:18:35.214 --> 01:18:37.824
why can't you tell me
where you were?

1356
01:18:48.676 --> 01:18:50.504
I had a dream...

1357
01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:52.208
the other night.

1358
01:18:52.268 --> 01:18:53.965
I dreamt that...

1359
01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:56.418
Buddy was gone.

1360
01:18:57.676 --> 01:18:59.160
I ran to his crib...

1361
01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.098
and there he was,
sleeping like an angel.

1362
01:19:02.201 --> 01:19:03.645
And you know...

1363
01:19:03.825 --> 01:19:07.583
I thanked God for letting me
still have Buddy.

1364
01:19:07.936 --> 01:19:10.191
And I remembered...

1365
01:19:10.629 --> 01:19:12.762
having the same reaction...

1366
01:19:12.872 --> 01:19:14.560
after Frank would beat me,

1367
01:19:14.582 --> 01:19:18.105
thanking the Lord for giving me
the strength to take it.

1368
01:19:18.162 --> 01:19:19.889
And I remembered...

1369
01:19:20.483 --> 01:19:24.412
thanking the Lord for
each day that my mother lived.

1370
01:19:25.915 --> 01:19:29.211
Even when she was
spitting up blood and...

1371
01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.431
praying for me to kill her.

1372
01:19:33.188 --> 01:19:35.251
I looked in my mother's eyes,

1373
01:19:35.304 --> 01:19:37.391
pleading for me to help her.

1374
01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.094
And all I could do...

1375
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:40.891
was pray.

1376
01:19:45.807 --> 01:19:47.276
While...

1377
01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:48.721
While you were gone,

1378
01:19:48.766 --> 01:19:50.541
as I was holding Buddy,
I thought,...

1379
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:51.799
if that...

1380
01:19:51.846 --> 01:19:53.260
bastard,...

1381
01:19:53.448 --> 01:19:57.494
Frank Bennett, ever tries
to take my child,...

1382
01:19:59.112 --> 01:20:00.963
I won't pray.

1383
01:20:02.528 --> 01:20:04.666
I'll break his neck.

1384
01:20:08.357 --> 01:20:11.610
Ruth, you don't have to worry
about Frank Bennett any more.

1385
01:20:12.613 --> 01:20:14.618
How can you say that?

1386
01:20:14.891 --> 01:20:16.391
It's his child too.

1387
01:20:16.446 --> 01:20:18.704
He won't give up on his blood.

1388
01:20:19.096 --> 01:20:21.938
I'm only gonna tell you this one time.

1389
01:20:24.439 --> 01:20:27.423
Frank Bennett won't be
bothering you no more.

1390
01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.469
You understand?

1391
01:20:33.133 --> 01:20:34.911
You killed him...

1392
01:20:36.282 --> 01:20:37.790
didn't you?

1393
01:20:38.054 --> 01:20:39.518
No.

1394
01:20:48.384 --> 01:20:50.180
You don't believe me.

1395
01:20:50.984 --> 01:20:53.656
Right now, I don't know
what to believe.

1396
01:20:56.317 --> 01:20:59.922
Believe me when I tell you
I don't want you to move out.

1399
01:21:22.683 --> 01:21:25.936
âª <i>As I go</i> âª

1400
01:21:26.068 --> 01:21:27.482
Finally.

1401
01:21:28.904 --> 01:21:29.904
Thanks.

1402
01:21:29.954 --> 01:21:31.811
I've been out here all day.

1403
01:21:32.424 --> 01:21:35.598
âª If I can show

1404
01:21:35.993 --> 01:21:41.496
âª <i>Somebody</i> âª

1405

âª <i>No, it shall not be in vain</i> âª

1410
01:21:59.073 --> 01:22:00.722
Uh, excuse me.

1411
01:22:00.762 --> 01:22:02.537
Uh, I was waiting for that space.

1412
01:22:02.576 --> 01:22:03.998
Yeah? Tough!

1413
01:22:04.043 --> 01:22:06.547
Face it, lady,
we're younger and faster.

1414
01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:29.394
Towanda.

1415
01:22:36.313 --> 01:22:38.508
- Hey!
- Yeah!

1416
01:22:39.196 --> 01:22:42.805
Whoa, whoa!

1417
01:22:46.998 --> 01:22:49.725
Towanda!

1418
01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.928
Yes, ma'am!

1419
01:22:56.022 --> 01:22:59.272
Whoa, whoa!

1420
01:23:01.587 --> 01:23:02.860
Help!

1421
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:04.040
Someone!

1422
01:23:04.078 --> 01:23:06.743
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1423
01:23:06.883 --> 01:23:08.110
Face it, girls.

1424
01:23:08.163 --> 01:23:10.805
I'm older and I have more insurance.

1425
01:23:19.885 --> 01:23:22.018
I never get mad,
Mrs. Threadgoode.

1426
01:23:22.042 --> 01:23:23.049
Never.

1427
01:23:23.094 --> 01:23:25.549
The way I was raised,
it was bad manners.

1428
01:23:25.617 --> 01:23:27.042
Well, I got mad.

1429
01:23:27.104 --> 01:23:28.776
And it felt terrific.

1430
01:23:28.815 --> 01:23:32.151
I felt like I could beat the shit
out of all those punks.

1431
01:23:32.197 --> 01:23:33.378
Excuse my language.

1432
01:23:33.403 --> 01:23:35.005
Just beat 'em to a pulp.

1433
01:23:35.057 --> 01:23:37.120
Beat 'em till they begged for mercy.

1434
01:23:37.164 --> 01:23:39.104
Towanda the avenger.

1435
01:23:39.159 --> 01:23:42.558
And after I, after I wipe out
all the punks in this world,

1436
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:44.989
I'll take on the wife-beaters
like Frank Bennett...

1437
01:23:45.044 --> 01:23:46.786
and machine-gun their genitals.

1438
01:23:48.724 --> 01:23:50.895
Towanda will go on the rampage.

1439
01:23:50.937 --> 01:23:53.749
I'll put tiny little bombs in
Penthouse and Playboy,

1440
01:23:53.788 --> 01:23:55.781
so they'll explode
when you open them.

1441
01:23:55.849 --> 01:23:57.999
And I'll ban all fashion models

1442
01:23:58.062 --> 01:24:01.187
who weigh less than 130 pounds.

1443
01:24:02.124 --> 01:24:05.710
And I'll give half the military budget
to people over 65.

1444
01:24:05.761 --> 01:24:08.522
And declare wrinkles sexually desirable.

1445
01:24:08.593 --> 01:24:09.788
Towanda...

1446
01:24:09.843 --> 01:24:13.163
righter of wrongs,
queen beyond compare.

1447
01:24:13.366 --> 01:24:16.741
How many of them hormones
are you taking, honey?

1448
01:24:24.184 --> 01:24:28.319
âª <i>Oh, when you give more than you get</i> âª

1449
01:24:28.374 --> 01:24:30.187
âª <i>You're in danger</i> âª

1450
01:24:30.236 --> 01:24:31.840
Well, honey...

1451
01:24:32.185 --> 01:24:34.598
what I can't understand is,

1452
01:24:34.749 --> 01:24:36.590
how in the hell...

1453
01:24:36.794 --> 01:24:38.411
you could hit someone...

1454
01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:40.419
six times by accident?

1455
01:24:40.477 --> 01:24:41.778
Oh, Ed.

1456
01:24:41.856 --> 01:24:44.762
Don't make such a big deal about it.

1457
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:52.538
What the hell's this?

1458
01:24:52.595 --> 01:24:54.679
That's a low-cholesterol meal.

1459
01:24:54.762 --> 01:24:56.217
Happy Valentine's.

1460
01:24:56.279 --> 01:24:57.904
âª <i>That's danger</i> âª

1461
01:24:57.943 --> 01:25:00.182
âª <i>And heartbreak dead ahead</i> âª

1462
01:25:00.237 --> 01:25:01.323
God!

1463
01:25:01.354 --> 01:25:03.518
Are you trying to kill me?

1464
01:25:03.583 --> 01:25:06.455
If I was gonna kill you,
I'd use my hands.

1465
01:25:06.850 --> 01:25:10.884
âª Stop! In the name of love âª

1466
01:25:10.944 --> 01:25:14.221
âª Before you break my heart âª

1467
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:16.940
âª Think it over âª

1468
01:25:18.151 --> 01:25:20.538
âª Think it over âª

1469
01:25:23.154 --> 01:25:25.787
I'm worried about
my little friend Evelyn.

1470
01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.818
She said her husband, Ed, would just be
sitting around watching his sports on TV,

1471
01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:34.162
and she has an urge to hit him
in the head with a baseball bat.

1472
01:25:34.192 --> 01:25:37.077
Oh hell, that seems normal to me.

1473
01:25:37.592 --> 01:25:39.146
- Hi, Janeen.
- Mmm-hmm.

1474
01:25:39.181 --> 01:25:41.685
Hi, Mrs. Threadgoode.
Would you like some cruditÃ©s?

1475
01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:43.100
Oh, thank you, Evelyn, but...

1476
01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:45.757
this raw stuff don't
sit good with me.

1477
01:25:46.023 --> 01:25:47.702
Mrs. Threadgoode...

1478
01:25:47.788 --> 01:25:50.100
you have to tell me something.

1479
01:25:50.258 --> 01:25:52.608
Did Idgie murder
Frank Bennett or not?

1480
01:25:52.659 --> 01:25:54.952
Well, hold your horses, honey.

1481
01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.889
Where were we?

1482
01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.607
You didn't kill Ed,
now, did you?

1483
01:26:01.046 --> 01:26:02.435
Not yet.

1484
01:26:02.533 --> 01:26:04.208
Oh, good.

1485
01:26:04.686 --> 01:26:06.123
Anyway.

1486
01:26:06.201 --> 01:26:09.958
Five years had passed
since Frank Bennett disappeared.

1487
01:26:10.143 --> 01:26:14.279
<i>And Smokey Lonesome had been missing
ever since that same terrible night.</i>

1488
01:26:14.337 --> 01:26:17.115
<i>I remember the day
when he showed up again.</i>

1489
01:26:18.212 --> 01:26:19.990
My God, son.

1490
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:22.684
You're the spitting image of Ruth.

1491
01:26:22.837 --> 01:26:24.348
Buddy Threadgoode Junior.

1492
01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:25.888
Nice to meet you, sir.

1493
01:26:25.985 --> 01:26:27.880
Well, sir, Smokey Lonesome.

1494
01:26:28.137 --> 01:26:32.100
<i>Curtis Smoote was making
one of his visits to Whistle Stop, Alabama.</i>

1495
01:26:32.135 --> 01:26:35.841
<i>Still hunting and pecking
for any scrap of evidence about</i>

1496
01:26:35.887 --> 01:26:37.942
Frank Bennett's whereabouts.

1497
01:26:37.989 --> 01:26:39.881
- Who wants to begin?
- Oh, I do!

1498
01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.434
- Miss Ruth, I do.
- I do, Miss Ruth.

1499
01:26:41.473 --> 01:26:42.911
- I do, Miss Ruth.
- Thank you.

1500
01:26:42.979 --> 01:26:45.528
All right,
we'll begin on page five.

1501
01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:48.848
<i>Life has a funny way
of working things out.</i>

1502
01:26:49.032 --> 01:26:50.747
Well, hey there!

1503
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:52.523
<i>Smokey!</i>

1504
01:26:53.304 --> 01:26:55.703
- Idgie?
- Smokey Lonesome.

1505
01:26:55.929 --> 01:26:58.195
Well, if it isn't old home week!

1506
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:59.505
How are you?

1507
01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.912
Well, I'm rattling but I'm rolling.

1508
01:27:01.964 --> 01:27:04.146
Well, what brings you to these pans?

1509
01:27:04.237 --> 01:27:05.497
The smell of good cooking.

1510
01:27:05.529 --> 01:27:07.122
Hey, Smokey.

1511
01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:10.247
- Sipsey.
- Well, let me fix you some lunch.

1512
01:27:10.329 --> 01:27:14.636
I think you know just about everybody
except maybe Curtis Smoote.

1513
01:27:14.685 --> 01:27:17.282
He's an officer from over
Valdosta, Georgia.

1514
01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:20.490
He's been looking for the same man
for almost five years.

1515
01:27:20.545 --> 01:27:22.740
Very stubborn fella.

1516
01:27:22.844 --> 01:27:25.109
<i>He loves our barbecue.</i>

1517
01:27:26.276 --> 01:27:27.949
<i>Mommy!</i>

1518
01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.773
<i>Mommy, help!</i>

1519
01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.305
Buddy!

1520
01:27:36.041 --> 01:27:37.932
Buddy. Buddy!

1521
01:27:37.971 --> 01:27:39.651
- Everybody out of the way.
- Let me in.

1522
01:27:39.683 --> 01:27:41.018
Give him here.
Give him here.

1523
01:27:41.057 --> 01:27:42.761
- Get him to the doctor, now!
- Come on.

1524
01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:44.533
Let him go.
I got him. Let him go.

1525
01:27:44.588 --> 01:27:46.639
- Please, hurry!
- I know. Let me with him.

1526
01:27:46.664 --> 01:27:47.723
You're gonna be all right.

1527
01:27:47.748 --> 01:27:49.319
- Open the door!
- He's gonna be fine.

1528
01:27:49.362 --> 01:27:50.885
All right, calm down.

1529
01:27:51.190 --> 01:27:52.580
Put him, yeah.
Put him in the back.

1530
01:27:52.605 --> 01:27:55.124
Get him in the car.
It's all right, honey.

1531
01:28:16.307 --> 01:28:19.827
I can understand
having a funeral for an arm.

1532
01:28:19.921 --> 01:28:23.934
I just don't know why
she insists on calling him "Stump"?

1533
01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:26.958
Well, she said everybody else
is gonna be calling him that.

1534
01:28:26.989 --> 01:28:29.481
So we might just as well be the first.

1535
01:28:31.667 --> 01:28:34.965
<i>Okay, ice cream and cakes
for everybody in the cafÃ©.</i>

1536
01:28:35.022 --> 01:28:36.929
Go on.

1537
01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:39.983
- Ice cream and cake.
- All right, I am first.

1538
01:28:41.741 --> 01:28:45.975
My daddy always used to say
there was a separate God for children.

1539
01:28:48.795 --> 01:28:52.334
<i>The good Lord was
watching over Stump that day.</i>

1540
01:28:52.664 --> 01:28:55.615
<i>But then, it started to rain that month.</i>

1541
01:28:55.764 --> 01:29:00.600
<i>And it rained and it rained
and it flooded parts of Whistle Stop.</i>

1542
01:29:00.966 --> 01:29:03.782
<i>And that's why Grady's
deputy stumbled on to</i>

1543
01:29:03.829 --> 01:29:06.056
<i>Frank Bennett's pick-up truck.</i>

1544
01:29:06.247 --> 01:29:10.688
<i>And I just knew Idgie'd
never get out of this mess.</i>

1545
01:29:10.726 --> 01:29:12.446
Now, are you in or out?

1546
01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.461
Remember, Ruth,
I didn't take any cards.

1547
01:29:14.501 --> 01:29:16.712
Look at me, Idgie Threadgoode.
Let me see your face.

1548
01:29:16.758 --> 01:29:18.719
- Idgie, I have to talk to you.
- You're bluffing.

1549
01:29:18.829 --> 01:29:21.649
Hi, Grady, why don't you sit in?
I'll deal you a new hand.

1550
01:29:21.674 --> 01:29:22.860
Gladys won't mind.

1551
01:29:22.902 --> 01:29:24.649
In private, Idgie.

1552
01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:26.850
Excuse us, Ruth.

1553
01:29:28.233 --> 01:29:29.553
Well.

1554
01:29:30.022 --> 01:29:32.389
I'm just trying to teach you
not to fall for any tricks.

1555
01:29:32.427 --> 01:29:34.615
You're doing a great job.

1556
01:29:43.808 --> 01:29:45.813
What's your hurry?

1557
01:29:45.974 --> 01:29:48.073
And what is so important?

1558
01:29:51.006 --> 01:29:52.287
What's that?

1559
01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:55.683
Somebody found
Frank Bennett's truck in the river.

1560
01:29:56.730 --> 01:29:58.793
What's that got to do with me?

1561
01:29:58.883 --> 01:30:02.457
Well, officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

1562
01:30:02.668 --> 01:30:05.250
You're in my custody until tomorrow.

1563
01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:08.968
I'm supposed to take you over to Georgia
first thing in the morning.

1564
01:30:09.996 --> 01:30:12.269
Unless, of course--

1565
01:30:12.822 --> 01:30:15.035
Well, some people have been known

1566
01:30:15.067 --> 01:30:18.051
to pack up and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night.

1567
01:30:22.029 --> 01:30:24.145
What about Big George?

1568
01:30:24.897 --> 01:30:26.794
Well, the way I figure it,...

1569
01:30:26.856 --> 01:30:29.474
they'd be satisfied if they had him.

1570
01:30:30.409 --> 01:30:32.414
Idgie, this is serious.

1571
01:30:32.505 --> 01:30:34.817
We're talking murder of a white man.

1572
01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:36.989
Someone's gonna have to pay.

1573
01:30:37.239 --> 01:30:39.301
Nobody wants to hang a woman.

1574
01:30:41.598 --> 01:30:43.270
No deal.

1575
01:30:43.911 --> 01:30:46.505
Hey, Idgie, I know how
you feel about Big George.

1576
01:30:46.536 --> 01:30:48.249
Hell, we all do.

1577
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.163
But, these are just the facts of life.

1578
01:30:54.617 --> 01:30:56.261
I can't do that.

1579
01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.683
Take me to jail if you have to.

1580
01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:01.862
Well, that's what I thought you'd say!

1581
01:31:02.121 --> 01:31:04.665
Cos you are absolutely,
unconditionally,

1582
01:31:04.708 --> 01:31:08.704
positively the most stubborn person
I've ever known in my life!

1583
01:31:10.587 --> 01:31:15.310
<i>So, Idgie and Big George went
to the county jail in Valdosta,...</i>

1584
01:31:15.393 --> 01:31:18.841
<i>to await trial for the murder
of Frank Bennett.</i>

1585
01:31:19.231 --> 01:31:21.401
<i>They didn't have to wait too long.</i>

1586
01:31:21.458 --> 01:31:23.270
Did you know Frank Bennett?

1587
01:31:23.338 --> 01:31:24.661
No, sir.

1588
01:31:25.006 --> 01:31:26.192
You mean to tell me...

1589
01:31:26.232 --> 01:31:28.661
you never met the man
whose wife, Ruth,...

1590
01:31:28.708 --> 01:31:30.388
is your business partner?

1591
01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:31.770
<i>That's right.</i>

1592
01:31:31.838 --> 01:31:34.176
And you never threatened
to kill Frank Bennett,...

1593
01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:38.646
at his home in front of
his hired man, in June of 1932,...

1594
01:31:38.686 --> 01:31:41.170
the same Frank Bennett
you did not know?

1595
01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:43.715
<i>Oh, that was me, all right.</i>

1596
01:31:43.779 --> 01:31:46.185
<i>I thought you wanted to know
if we'd ever met.</i>

1597
01:31:46.232 --> 01:31:48.209
<i>The answer's "no". Um...</i>

1598
01:31:48.422 --> 01:31:50.834
<i>I threatened to kill him, but...</i>

1599
01:31:50.974 --> 01:31:53.733
we were never what you might say,
properly introduced.

1600
01:31:53.763 --> 01:31:56.771
Is it not true that
in September of 1932,

1601
01:31:56.796 --> 01:32:00.193
you came to Valdosta and took
Frank Bennett's wife and child

1602
01:32:00.232 --> 01:32:01.700
back to Alabama with you?

1603
01:32:01.747 --> 01:32:03.177
Mmm, just the wife.

1604
01:32:03.208 --> 01:32:04.372
The child came later.

1605
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.122
How much later?

1606
01:32:06.388 --> 01:32:08.958
The usual.
Nine months.

1607
01:32:09.497 --> 01:32:11.779
Well, I suggest that you bribed...

1608
01:32:11.823 --> 01:32:14.661
this poor weak woman
with promises of...

1609
01:32:14.724 --> 01:32:16.318
liquor and money...

1610
01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:17.538
and she lost...

1611
01:32:17.585 --> 01:32:20.130
control of her senses, momentarily.

1612
01:32:20.175 --> 01:32:23.286
And when her husband came back
to get her and take her home,...

1613
01:32:23.336 --> 01:32:24.927
you and your coloured man...

1614
01:32:24.974 --> 01:32:28.372
murdered him in cold blood.

1615
01:32:29.569 --> 01:32:30.930
No, sir.

1616
01:32:31.235 --> 01:32:32.258
Well...

1617
01:32:32.297 --> 01:32:36.109
Where were you on the night of
September 30th, 1933?

1618
01:32:36.156 --> 01:32:38.484
I was at the town hall,
doing a show.

1619
01:32:38.523 --> 01:32:40.148
And after that?

1620
01:32:40.336 --> 01:32:42.227
I was over at my mother's house.

1621
01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:44.188
Oh, yeah?
Who was with you?

1622
01:32:44.281 --> 01:32:46.408
Just Big George and myself.

1623
01:32:46.435 --> 01:32:48.977
What about your mother?
Can she confirm that?

1624
01:32:49.023 --> 01:32:51.180
No, sir.
She died a year ago.

1625
01:32:51.242 --> 01:32:53.758
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
But, Miss Threadgoode,

1626
01:32:53.789 --> 01:32:57.305
you expect 12 intelligent men
to believe you,...

1627
01:32:57.385 --> 01:33:00.236
although one witness is dead
and the other is a coloured man

1628
01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:01.510
known to be a...

1629
01:33:01.555 --> 01:33:03.617
worthless, no-good, lying nigger?

1630
01:33:03.642 --> 01:33:06.316
You expect these men
to take your word for it

1631
01:33:06.361 --> 01:33:08.781
<i>just because you say so?</i>

1632
01:33:08.808 --> 01:33:13.128
That's right, you gump-faced,
blown-up, baboon-assed bastard!

1633
01:33:13.173 --> 01:33:14.705
Oh.

1634
01:33:15.931 --> 01:33:19.634
One more outburst like that,
I'll hold you in contempt of court.

1635
01:33:19.681 --> 01:33:21.126
You understand?

1636
01:33:21.399 --> 01:33:22.860
Yes, sir.

1637
01:33:24.767 --> 01:33:26.181
Lord!

1638
01:33:26.755 --> 01:33:28.743
Next witness, please.

1639
01:33:31.142 --> 01:33:35.457
<i>Did you know that you were pregnant
at the time you left Valdosta?</i>

1640
01:33:35.496 --> 01:33:36.735
<i>Yes.</i>

1641
01:33:36.806 --> 01:33:37.970
<i>And yet...</i>

1642
01:33:38.001 --> 01:33:41.149
<i>you tell us over and over...</i>

1643
01:33:41.251 --> 01:33:44.314
<i>that you went with this woman...</i>

1644
01:33:44.384 --> 01:33:45.931
willingly?

1645
01:33:46.243 --> 01:33:50.001
Yes, I wouldn't raise my child
with Frank Bennett.

1646
01:33:50.046 --> 01:33:52.051
<i>But, why?</i>

1647
01:33:52.204 --> 01:33:55.163
<i>Did this woman promise you money?</i>

1648
01:33:55.225 --> 01:33:56.470
No.

1649
01:33:56.549 --> 01:33:58.587
<i>A bigger home?</i>

1650
01:33:59.137 --> 01:34:00.634
No.

1651
01:34:00.853 --> 01:34:02.173
No.

1652
01:34:02.290 --> 01:34:04.860
<i>Then tell us, Mrs. Bennett,</i>

1653
01:34:05.032 --> 01:34:07.745
<i>why would a respectable
Christian woman...</i>

1654
01:34:07.792 --> 01:34:10.120
<i>go anywhere with this
Idgie Threadgoode,...</i>

1655
01:34:10.159 --> 01:34:12.393
<i>- whose reputation is known
- Objection!</i>

1656
01:34:12.425 --> 01:34:16.333
- far and wide as a notorious liar...
- Objection sustained.

1657
01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:25.950
<i>Why did you leave with
Idgie Threadgoode that day?</i>

1658
01:34:28.407 --> 01:34:30.911
<i>Answer the question, Mrs. Bennett.</i>

1659
01:34:32.619 --> 01:34:34.478
Because she...

1660
01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:40.861
she's the best friend I ever had.

1661
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:42.626
And I love her.

1662
01:34:43.991 --> 01:34:46.291
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Bennett.
That will be all.</i>

1663
01:34:46.374 --> 01:34:49.572
<i>The defense calls as its last witness,...</i>

1664
01:34:49.658 --> 01:34:52.806
the Reverend Herbert Scroggins.

1665
01:34:54.533 --> 01:34:56.916
Place your right hand on the Bible,
please, Reverend.

1666
01:34:56.963 --> 01:34:59.611
I brought my own,
if you don't mind.

1667
01:35:00.805 --> 01:35:04.141
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1668
01:35:04.186 --> 01:35:05.665
I do.

1669
01:35:08.612 --> 01:35:12.110
<i>Do you have information
about the whereabouts of...</i>

1670
01:35:12.157 --> 01:35:14.559
<i>Idgie Threadgoode
and her coloured man,</i>

1671
01:35:14.607 --> 01:35:16.161
known as Big George,...

1672
01:35:16.231 --> 01:35:20.262
on the night of
September 30th, 1933?

1673
01:35:20.336 --> 01:35:21.801
Yes, sir, I do.

1674
01:35:21.857 --> 01:35:24.411
<i>Really?
It has been suggested here...</i>

1675
01:35:24.481 --> 01:35:27.864
<i>that she and her coloured man
were at her mother's house.</i>

1676
01:35:27.975 --> 01:35:29.756
<i>Can you confirm that?</i>

1677
01:35:29.883 --> 01:35:31.295
No, sir.

1678
01:35:31.444 --> 01:35:33.194
That is a lie.

1679
01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.811
Oh, shit.

1680
01:35:35.069 --> 01:35:36.624
<i>It has been my habit...</i>

1681
01:35:36.687 --> 01:35:38.444
<i>to write down all the dates...</i>

1682
01:35:38.475 --> 01:35:41.296
<i>of the activities of
the church in my Bible.</i>

1683
01:35:41.379 --> 01:35:46.217
<i>And I show that the night
of September 30th, 1933...</i>

1684
01:35:46.291 --> 01:35:49.124
was the start of our annual revival...

1685
01:35:49.194 --> 01:35:51.749
down at the Baptist camp ground.

1686
01:35:52.426 --> 01:35:54.890
Sister Threadgoode was there,...

1687
01:35:55.027 --> 01:35:58.332
<i>along with her hired man,
George Pullman,...</i>

1688
01:35:58.512 --> 01:36:01.052
who was in charge of the barbecue,...

1689
01:36:01.152 --> 01:36:03.238
just as he has been every year

1690
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:05.520
<i>- for the last ten years.
- Objection!</i>

1691
01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:06.926
That doesn't mean anything.

1692
01:36:06.965 --> 01:36:10.067
Murder could have taken place
any time in the next few days.

1693
01:36:10.121 --> 01:36:13.270
Have you ever been
to one of our revivals, sir?

1694
01:36:13.324 --> 01:36:14.903
<i>Well, no.</i>

1695
01:36:15.106 --> 01:36:18.137
Do you attend church regularly, sir?

1696
01:36:18.231 --> 01:36:19.590
Of course, I do.

1697
01:36:19.676 --> 01:36:20.926
<i>Good.</i>

1698
01:36:21.035 --> 01:36:24.098
<i>Well, maybe if you attended
one of our revivals,...</i>

1699
01:36:24.153 --> 01:36:28.044
you'd know they last
three days and three nights.

1700
01:36:28.089 --> 01:36:29.543
Your Honour.

1701
01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:34.444
<i>Approach the bench.</i>

1702
01:36:34.882 --> 01:36:36.061
Percy,...

1703
01:36:36.108 --> 01:36:38.795
it don't look like
you've got a case at all.

1704
01:36:38.904 --> 01:36:41.397
In the first place, there's no body.

1705
01:36:41.475 --> 01:36:44.826
Second, we've got us a preacher
nobody's going to dispute.

1706
01:36:44.873 --> 01:36:47.654
- But, Your Honour--
- I'm telling you what you've got...

1707
01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.592
is a whole lot of nothing.

1708
01:36:49.733 --> 01:36:52.295
<i>I say Frank Bennett
got himself drunk,...</i>

1709
01:36:52.413 --> 01:36:54.186
<i>drove into the river...</i>

1710
01:36:54.264 --> 01:36:55.990
<i>and was long ago eaten up.</i>

1711
01:36:56.022 --> 01:36:59.686
And I don't give
a good goddamn!

1712
01:36:59.928 --> 01:37:03.405
What we got us here
is a case of accidental death.

1713
01:37:03.455 --> 01:37:05.342
Case dismissed!

1714
01:37:05.413 --> 01:37:06.725
Whoo!

1715
01:37:14.542 --> 01:37:17.075
See you in church, sister?

1716
01:37:18.233 --> 01:37:19.919
Reverend.

1717
01:37:20.708 --> 01:37:24.012
I can't believe he actually
swore on the Bible.

1718
01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:27.012
Well, not really.

1719
01:37:27.076 --> 01:37:28.965
If that judge had looked any closer,...

1720
01:37:29.013 --> 01:37:32.325
he'd have seen it was really
a copy of Moby Dick.

1721
01:37:34.367 --> 01:37:36.395
But, why did he do it?

1722
01:37:36.462 --> 01:37:38.668
For the sheer joy of
seeing you in church again,...

1723
01:37:38.724 --> 01:37:41.583
which I suggested to him
might be your penance.

1724
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:44.192
- You didn't promise him?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

1725
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:46.176
And I never break my word.

1726
01:37:46.231 --> 01:37:50.544
If I live a thousand years,
I will never forgive you for this.

1727
01:37:50.685 --> 01:37:53.398
I don't know what's worse,
church or jail.

1728
01:38:06.075 --> 01:38:07.513
There now.

1729
01:38:07.622 --> 01:38:09.427
Don't you look pretty?

1730
01:38:09.583 --> 01:38:11.419
Oh, yes, honey.

1731
01:38:11.833 --> 01:38:15.621
You'll have me looking like
Ginger Rogers before you're done.

1732
01:38:15.802 --> 01:38:17.957
But, don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.

1733
01:38:17.997 --> 01:38:20.426
He's liable to go wild.

1734
01:38:21.755 --> 01:38:24.801
Well, I'm glad to see
you're in a good mood.

1735
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:27.895
And you've slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks.

1736
01:38:27.973 --> 01:38:29.895
I'm just so happy...

1737
01:38:29.958 --> 01:38:32.505
Big George and Idgie got off.

1738
01:38:32.598 --> 01:38:35.598
I would have killed
Frank Bennett if I could.

1739
01:38:35.739 --> 01:38:38.216
Did anybody really think she did it?

1740
01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:40.840
Some said yes, some said no.

1741
01:38:41.028 --> 01:38:44.059
Of course, the only one who
really knew was Frank Bennett.

1742
01:38:44.145 --> 01:38:45.973
And you know what they say.

1743
01:38:46.083 --> 01:38:49.012
Dead men tell no tales.

1744
01:38:50.237 --> 01:38:53.105
Towanda!

1745
01:39:16.245 --> 01:39:18.823
Evelyn, what in the hell
are you doing?

1746
01:39:18.859 --> 01:39:20.909
I need some light and air.

1747
01:39:21.959 --> 01:39:23.580
Why don't you step outside...

1748
01:39:23.611 --> 01:39:25.650
and take one of your walks
or your jog or...

1749
01:39:25.690 --> 01:39:27.675
whatever it is you do?

1750
01:39:28.779 --> 01:39:31.090
And there's no dinner, either!

1751
01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:33.910
Ed, you have any idea...

1752
01:39:33.949 --> 01:39:36.191
why I've been going
to all these classes?

1753
01:39:36.230 --> 01:39:37.246
<i>No.</i>

1754
01:39:37.285 --> 01:39:39.754
I've been trying to save our marriage.

1755
01:39:39.867 --> 01:39:41.215
What's the point of my trying

1756
01:39:41.246 --> 01:39:43.817
if you're gonna just sit
on your butt drinking beer...

1757
01:39:43.864 --> 01:39:45.746
and watching baseball...

1758
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:48.277
basketball...

1759
01:39:48.329 --> 01:39:49.590
football...

1760
01:39:49.636 --> 01:39:51.902
bowling and hockey and...

1761
01:39:51.941 --> 01:39:53.426
golf and...

1762
01:39:53.668 --> 01:39:56.191
challenge of the Gladiators?

1763
01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:04.299
Mrs. Couch?

1764
01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:06.799
I'm Sue, Mrs. Otis's daughter-in-law.

1765
01:40:06.831 --> 01:40:09.002
Well, hi.
How are you?

1766
01:40:09.033 --> 01:40:11.064
I've heard so much about you
from Mrs. Threadgoode.

1767
01:40:11.096 --> 01:40:12.494
Oh, she is so sweet.

1768
01:40:12.534 --> 01:40:14.940
She's been looking after
my mother-in-law for years now.

1769
01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:17.135
Well, now, how is Mrs. Otis doing,
by the way?

1770
01:40:17.190 --> 01:40:18.885
Oh, much better.
Thank you.

1771
01:40:18.963 --> 01:40:22.283
I guess it just takes time
getting used to a strange place.

1772
01:40:22.309 --> 01:40:23.410
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1773
01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:26.419
I know Mrs. Threadgoode's been anxious
to get home for some time now.

1774
01:40:26.453 --> 01:40:28.080
Mrs. Couch,...

1775
01:40:28.213 --> 01:40:30.432
Mrs. Threadgoode doesn't
have a house any more.

1776
01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:32.198
They tore that down.

1777
01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:33.690
What?

1778
01:40:33.729 --> 01:40:35.356
Well, they had to.
It was falling apart.

1779
01:40:35.386 --> 01:40:37.067
And it was condemned.

1780
01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:39.591
Oh, no.

1781
01:40:40.961 --> 01:40:42.432
Does she know that?

1782
01:40:42.488 --> 01:40:45.197
No, well, we didn't see
any point in telling her.

1783
01:40:45.248 --> 01:40:48.216
It would just break her heart,
poor old thing.

1784
01:40:49.179 --> 01:40:51.932
But, I am so glad
I got a chance to meet you.

1785
01:40:51.973 --> 01:40:54.404
You take care of yourself, now.
Bye-bye.

1786
01:42:04.835 --> 01:42:05.881
Oh.

1787
01:42:05.926 --> 01:42:07.639
Evelyn, hey.

1788
01:42:07.678 --> 01:42:09.428
Hey.

1789
01:42:09.739 --> 01:42:12.013
Do you like my roses?

1790
01:42:12.217 --> 01:42:14.123
Since I can't get home...

1791
01:42:14.239 --> 01:42:18.076
to look at my own roses,
I made myself a paper garden.

1792
01:42:18.148 --> 01:42:21.763
- I've got everything but the bugs.
- They're lovely.

1793
01:42:22.004 --> 01:42:23.310
You been here long?

1794
01:42:23.373 --> 01:42:24.943
Happy birthday!

1795
01:42:24.974 --> 01:42:25.983
Oh.

1796
01:42:26.013 --> 01:42:28.638
- I shouldn't have woken you up.
- Of course, you should.

1797
01:42:28.701 --> 01:42:31.959
Don't you never let me sleep
through a visitor's day, honey.

1798
01:42:31.987 --> 01:42:33.928
I look forward to them all week.

1799
01:42:33.965 --> 01:42:36.412
So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode.
So do I.

1800
01:42:36.959 --> 01:42:38.201
Oh!

1801
01:42:38.236 --> 01:42:40.378
I can't believe you remembered!

1802
01:42:40.417 --> 01:42:43.323
You made me fried green tomatoes!

1803
01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:46.065
Mmm.

1804
01:42:46.128 --> 01:42:47.674
Mm, mmm.

1805
01:42:47.831 --> 01:42:50.151
- They're delicious.
- It's your recipe.

1806
01:42:50.190 --> 01:42:51.456
Are they cold?

1807
01:42:51.534 --> 01:42:55.354
No. They're just the way we used to
have them at the Whistle Stop CafÃ©.

1808
01:42:55.401 --> 01:42:57.159
Mmm.

1809
01:42:57.247 --> 01:43:00.229
You couldn't be sweeter to me
if you were my own daughter.

1810
01:43:00.279 --> 01:43:02.463
Mmm-hmm.
Here's your napkin.

1811
01:43:02.530 --> 01:43:04.416
And wait, wait, wait.

1812
01:43:04.807 --> 01:43:06.549
- Queen! Queen!
- Oh!

1813
01:43:10.622 --> 01:43:11.945
You know...

1814
01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:14.641
I don't feel 83.

1815
01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:17.195
It sort of slipped up on me.

1816
01:43:21.102 --> 01:43:24.358
I never expected to live this long.

1817
01:43:24.764 --> 01:43:28.561
Of course, the Lord takes us home
when he wants us.

1818
01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:41.102
Are you all right?

1819
01:43:42.948 --> 01:43:45.232
I was thinking about Ruth.

1820
01:43:46.869 --> 01:43:48.639
After the trial was over,...

1821
01:43:48.678 --> 01:43:50.897
everything went back to normal.

1822
01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:54.571
<i>Till that fall when Ruth lost her appetite.</i>

1823
01:43:55.225 --> 01:43:58.904
<i>By the time Dr. Hadley looked at her,
he said the cancer was so bad,</i>

1824
01:43:58.936 --> 01:44:01.498
<i>she only had a couple of weeks.</i>

1825
01:44:02.201 --> 01:44:04.811
<i>Well, we moved her to
the Threadgoode house and...</i>

1826
01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:08.021
<i>put her downstairs,
so she'd be more comfortable.</i>

1827
01:44:09.295 --> 01:44:13.264
<i>Sipsey moved in with her
and never left her side.</i>

1828
01:44:14.522 --> 01:44:19.944
<i>- Hold on, baby, I'm right here.
- Idgie just prayed for a miracle.</i>

1829
01:44:39.498 --> 01:44:41.695
Now, listen to me.

1830
01:44:43.238 --> 01:44:45.796
Make sure he graduates.

1831
01:44:46.125 --> 01:44:47.609
And don't...

1832
01:44:48.777 --> 01:44:50.296
let him come to the funeral.

1833
01:44:50.336 --> 01:44:53.062
I don't want him going
through that mess.

1834
01:44:53.094 --> 01:44:55.578
Would you quit talking like that?

1835
01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:57.882
What funeral?

1836
01:44:58.687 --> 01:45:03.078
You're gonna be back on your feet
feeling just fine in just a few days.

1837
01:45:04.035 --> 01:45:05.718
Just you wait.

1838
01:45:07.224 --> 01:45:08.466
Oh.

1839
01:45:08.508 --> 01:45:10.533
What's the matter, son?

1840
01:45:15.654 --> 01:45:18.174
Well, let's go for a walk.

1841
01:45:20.061 --> 01:45:22.229
<i>Did you get into a fight?</i>

1842
01:45:22.903 --> 01:45:24.346
I got punched in the nose.

1843
01:45:24.373 --> 01:45:26.768
I can't play like everyone else.

1844
01:45:28.257 --> 01:45:30.752
Hey, did I ever tell you
the story about...

1845
01:45:30.948 --> 01:45:32.299
the oysters?

1846
01:45:32.354 --> 01:45:34.471
All the millions of them
just lying around--

1847
01:45:34.497 --> 01:45:37.190
And God puts sand in one of them
and it makes a pearl.

1848
01:45:37.352 --> 01:45:38.745
Oh.

1849
01:45:40.924 --> 01:45:43.604
Did I ever tell you about
Eva's three-legged dog?

1850
01:45:43.686 --> 01:45:45.659
How it never felt sorry for itself,

1851
01:45:45.704 --> 01:45:47.698
and howl ought to be
smarter than a dumb dog,

1852
01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:50.080
and not feel sorry for myself?

1853
01:45:51.233 --> 01:45:54.229
You listen to everything I say,
don't you?

1854
01:45:54.604 --> 01:45:56.917
You get real mad at me
when I don't.

1855
01:45:58.417 --> 01:45:59.807
Well.

1856
01:46:01.921 --> 01:46:03.926
You know about your mama.

1857
01:46:04.982 --> 01:46:06.651
She's sick.

1858
01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:08.995
Mmm-hmm.

1859
01:46:11.096 --> 01:46:12.314
You see, now...

1860
01:46:12.344 --> 01:46:14.330
is the time for courage.

1861
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:17.533
I guess you already know that...

1862
01:46:18.146 --> 01:46:21.447
there are angels masquerading as people
walking around this planet,

1863
01:46:21.478 --> 01:46:23.884
and your mom is
the bravest one of those.

1864
01:46:29.403 --> 01:46:30.884
Come here.

1865
01:46:38.739 --> 01:46:41.373
Mommy, I got hit!
You should see me.

1866
01:46:41.398 --> 01:46:44.171
Aunt Idgie, she hit me
in the back with a curve ball.

1867
01:46:44.234 --> 01:46:46.805
I didn't duck and I hardly cried.

1868
01:46:47.127 --> 01:46:48.843
She hit you?

1869
01:46:49.930 --> 01:46:51.250
Well.

1870
01:46:51.351 --> 01:46:53.843
She did that to me once, too, but...

1871
01:46:53.929 --> 01:46:56.273
I think I did cry.

1872
01:46:59.631 --> 01:47:01.087
Mama?

1873
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:03.265
I'm sorry if you're sad.

1874
01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:05.203
Well.

1875
01:47:05.245 --> 01:47:08.992
Give me a big kiss, then,
and I'll never be sad again.

1876
01:47:15.695 --> 01:47:18.477
And you best not be sad neither.

1877
01:47:18.906 --> 01:47:20.651
You understand?

1878
01:47:22.153 --> 01:47:23.789
You promise?

1879
01:47:24.949 --> 01:47:26.320
Promise.

1880
01:47:26.799 --> 01:47:28.062
Attaboy.

1881
01:47:28.155 --> 01:47:30.062
You can go and wash up.

1882
01:47:54.265 --> 01:47:56.174
Sweet baby.

1883
01:47:59.766 --> 01:48:01.812
You two be alone now.

1884
01:48:04.166 --> 01:48:05.633
Hey, girl.

1885
01:48:09.902 --> 01:48:11.382
No, no.

1886
01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.029
That's nice.

1887
01:48:19.228 --> 01:48:21.509
Will you do one thing for me?

1888
01:48:21.847 --> 01:48:23.509
Yeah, anything.

1889
01:48:23.856 --> 01:48:25.821
Be good to yourself.

1890
01:48:26.126 --> 01:48:27.603
Even...

1891
01:48:28.505 --> 01:48:33.689
settle down if you can find someone
who can beat you in poker.

1892
01:48:41.508 --> 01:48:43.000
There are so many...

1893
01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:45.859
things I wanna say to you.

1894
01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:47.929
No.

1895
01:48:49.881 --> 01:48:51.968
I love your stories.

1896
01:48:52.653 --> 01:48:54.296
Tell me a story...

1897
01:48:54.429 --> 01:48:55.780
Idgie.

1898
01:48:59.851 --> 01:49:00.968
Oh...

1899
01:49:01.013 --> 01:49:02.281
God.

1900
01:49:02.485 --> 01:49:04.934
Go on, you old bee charmer.

1901
01:49:05.544 --> 01:49:08.325
Tell me a good tall tale.

1902
01:49:10.808 --> 01:49:13.546
Tell me the one about the lake.

1903
01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:16.812
What lake?

1904
01:49:16.844 --> 01:49:18.398
The one...

1905
01:49:18.765 --> 01:49:20.765
that used to be here.

1906
01:49:22.445 --> 01:49:23.788
Oh.

1907
01:49:26.311 --> 01:49:29.101
Well, that was just a lie.

1908
01:49:29.978 --> 01:49:32.038
I know that, fool.

1909
01:49:32.856 --> 01:49:34.655
Tell me anyway.

1910
01:49:36.349 --> 01:49:38.171
Tell me the story.

1911
01:49:40.015 --> 01:49:41.523
Well.

1912
01:49:45.434 --> 01:49:47.101
One time...

1913
01:49:47.974 --> 01:49:49.921
there was this lake.

1914
01:49:55.245 --> 01:49:56.323
And uh...

1915
01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.745
it was right outside of town.
And...

1916
01:50:00.115 --> 01:50:02.333
we used to go fishing and uh...

1917
01:50:02.388 --> 01:50:04.565
swimming and canoeing in it.

1918
01:50:05.151 --> 01:50:06.838
And uh...

1919
01:50:07.491 --> 01:50:10.650
see, one November,
this big flock of ducks...

1920
01:50:10.838 --> 01:50:12.916
came in and landed on that lake.

1921
01:50:12.971 --> 01:50:14.409
And uh...

1922
01:50:15.957 --> 01:50:20.466
And then, the temperature dropped so fast
that the lake just froze right there.

1923
01:50:20.862 --> 01:50:22.432
And the uh...

1924
01:50:23.198 --> 01:50:24.932
The ducks, they...

1925
01:50:27.158 --> 01:50:30.848
flew off, you see, and
they took that lake with them.

1926
01:50:31.137 --> 01:50:32.559
And...

1927
01:50:34.516 --> 01:50:38.051
Now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

1928
01:50:39.482 --> 01:50:41.332
Can you imagine?

1929
01:51:40.196 --> 01:51:42.201
It's all right, honey.

1930
01:51:43.687 --> 01:51:45.222
Let her go.

1931
01:51:46.332 --> 01:51:47.957
Let her go.

1932
01:51:49.746 --> 01:51:52.753
You know, Miss Ruth was a lady.

1933
01:51:54.049 --> 01:51:57.184
And a lady always knows...

1934
01:51:57.357 --> 01:51:59.036
when to leave.

1935
01:52:06.475 --> 01:52:10.271
<i>When I think on our departed sister,
Ruth Jamison,</i>

1936
01:52:10.529 --> 01:52:13.638
<i>I'm reminded of our Lord's
Sermon on the Mount.</i>

1937
01:52:13.857 --> 01:52:15.779
and how his teachings was amplified--

1938
01:52:15.818 --> 01:52:19.849
<i>It's funny how strong
Ruth affected everyone.</i>

1939
01:52:20.253 --> 01:52:22.677
<i>Even Smokey Lonesome.</i>

1940
01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:26.341
<i>When he died a few years back,...</i>

1941
01:52:26.488 --> 01:52:28.981
<i>he had one possession on him.</i>

1942
01:52:29.464 --> 01:52:31.880
<i>A picture of Ruth.</i>

1943
01:52:33.208 --> 01:52:36.763
<i>He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.</i>

1944
01:52:37.367 --> 01:52:39.193
<i>We all were.</i>

1945
01:52:46.283 --> 01:52:48.836
I shouldn't have told you this.

1946
01:52:50.639 --> 01:52:52.414
I hate death.

1947
01:52:52.951 --> 01:52:54.687
It scares me so.

1948
01:52:54.726 --> 01:52:57.125
Death is nothing to be afraid of.

1949
01:52:57.289 --> 01:52:59.461
Look at me.
I'm at the jumping-off place,

1950
01:52:59.516 --> 01:53:01.641
and I ain't afraid one bit.

1951
01:53:03.673 --> 01:53:05.493
Oh, Ninny.

1952
01:53:05.992 --> 01:53:07.969
You're so brave.

1953
01:53:08.963 --> 01:53:10.626
Ruth and Idgie were brave.

1954
01:53:10.672 --> 01:53:12.196
Not me.

1955
01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:16.133
I wouldn't be afraid
of death if I was you.

1956
01:53:16.389 --> 01:53:18.079
I'd be more afraid of

1957
01:53:18.139 --> 01:53:20.829
driving in rush-hour traffic.

1958
01:53:23.613 --> 01:53:28.761
âª Oh oh ooh ooh âª

1959
01:53:28.801 --> 01:53:31.300
âª Just listen to that rain âª

1960
01:53:31.668 --> 01:53:33.889
âª Raining in the north âª

1961
01:53:34.113 --> 01:53:36.238
âª Raining in the south âª

1962
01:53:36.606 --> 01:53:38.707
âª Raining in the east âª

1963
01:53:39.090 --> 01:53:41.082
âª Raining in the west âª

1964
01:53:41.199 --> 01:53:43.748
âª Ooh-ooh âª

1965
01:53:43.916 --> 01:53:47.454
âª Tell me didn't it rain, children? âª

1966
01:53:47.490 --> 01:53:50.186
âª Rain, oh my Lord, didn't it? âª

1967
01:53:50.233 --> 01:53:51.584
âª You know it did âª

1968
01:53:51.670 --> 01:53:56.035
âª I said, oh my good Lord,
didn't it rain? âª

1969
01:53:56.125 --> 01:53:59.663
âª Hey, it rained 40 days and
40 nights without stopping âª

1970
01:53:59.688 --> 01:54:02.139
âª Noah got worried
and the rain kept a dropping âª

1971
01:54:02.164 --> 01:54:04.563
âª He sent out a raven, sent out a dove âª

1972
01:54:04.610 --> 01:54:06.953
âª The water, good God,
came down from above âª

1973
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.242
âª They tell me my God
when it started to rain âª

1974
01:54:09.274 --> 01:54:11.651
âª The women and the children
began to scream âª

1975
01:54:11.676 --> 01:54:14.122
âª They knocked on the window
and they batted at the door âª

1976
01:54:14.147 --> 01:54:16.792
âª While they, hoo-hoo, take on more âª

1977
01:54:16.849 --> 01:54:19.135
âª Noah said: No more, my friend âª

1978
01:54:19.184 --> 01:54:21.323
âª God's got the key, I can't let you in âª

1979
01:54:21.354 --> 01:54:23.956
âª Hoo, hoo âª

1980
01:54:24.034 --> 01:54:26.378
âª Listen to the rain âª

1981
01:54:26.487 --> 01:54:28.473
âª Oh-oh âª

1982
01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:31.208
âª Just listen to the rain âª

1983
01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:33.489
âª Listen to the rain âª

1984
01:54:33.575 --> 01:54:35.215
âª Just listen to the rain âª

1985
01:54:35.263 --> 01:54:36.442
âª Oh-oh, listen âª

1986
01:54:36.481 --> 01:54:37.653
âª Listen to the rain âª

1987
01:54:37.692 --> 01:54:38.958
âª Oh-oh, listen âª

1988
01:54:38.989 --> 01:54:40.137
âª Listen to the rain âª

1989
01:54:40.177 --> 01:54:41.357
âª Yeah, yeah, listen âª

1990
01:54:41.387 --> 01:54:42.606
âª Listen to the rain âª

1991
01:54:42.646 --> 01:54:43.833
âª Oh-oh, listen âª

1992
01:54:43.872 --> 01:54:45.069
âª Listen to the rain âª

1993
01:54:45.116 --> 01:54:46.319
âª Yeah, yeah, listen âª

1994
01:54:46.366 --> 01:54:48.038
âª Last chance âª

1995
01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:50.342
âª Listen to the rain now âª

1996
01:54:50.827 --> 01:54:53.555
âª And then drip, drop, drip, drop âª

1997
01:54:53.619 --> 01:54:56.157
âª Drip, drop, drip-drip a-drop âª

1998
01:54:56.197 --> 01:54:57.798
âª Drip, drop âª

1999
01:54:57.852 --> 01:55:00.298
âª Yeah, drip-drip a-drop âª

2000
01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:02.634
âª Now, drip, drop âª

2001
01:55:03.059 --> 01:55:05.212
âª Have drip-drip a-drop âª

2002
01:55:16.666 --> 01:55:18.346
- Hi, honey.
- Oh.

2003
01:55:18.418 --> 01:55:19.799
Look what I got you.

2004
01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:20.948
Oh.

2005
01:55:21.941 --> 01:55:23.104
Ed.

2006
01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.988
How sweet!

2007
01:55:25.389 --> 01:55:26.588
Lilies.

2008
01:55:26.635 --> 01:55:27.877
- Yeah.
- My favourite.

2009
01:55:27.917 --> 01:55:29.073
I know.

2010
01:55:29.111 --> 01:55:31.057
Sometimes, I even amaze myself.

2011
01:55:31.115 --> 01:55:32.502
What's the occasion?

2012
01:55:32.604 --> 01:55:33.627
Oh.

2013
01:55:33.663 --> 01:55:35.153
Honey, I just...

2014
01:55:35.317 --> 01:55:36.471
feel sorry about...

2015
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:38.247
the past few months,
you know?

2016
01:55:38.395 --> 01:55:40.174
I don't know what you're really up to,...

2017
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:42.174
what's going on with you, but...

2018
01:55:42.506 --> 01:55:45.522
I guess I could have been more helpful
with your job and everything.

2019
01:55:45.651 --> 01:55:46.952
You know?

2020
01:55:48.092 --> 01:55:49.866
Well, why are you uh...

2021
01:55:49.952 --> 01:55:53.092
Why are you putting up this wall
where you just tore one down?

2022
01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:54.358
Well...

2023
01:55:54.592 --> 01:55:56.475
I changed my mind.

2024
01:55:56.678 --> 01:55:58.163
Well, I don't mean to seem...

2025
01:55:58.226 --> 01:56:01.015
dense or anything,
but what's changed?

2026
01:56:01.118 --> 01:56:03.123
The air and the light.

2027
01:56:05.565 --> 01:56:07.075
Ed...

2028
01:56:08.282 --> 01:56:10.639
You remember how
you used to tell me...

2029
01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.366
you always wanted
two women in your house?

2030
01:56:13.428 --> 01:56:14.971
Oh, God.

2031
01:56:15.908 --> 01:56:17.346
Yeah.

2032
01:56:17.689 --> 01:56:19.049
Well...

2033
01:56:19.684 --> 01:56:22.557
what if I was the younger of the two?

2034
01:56:23.059 --> 01:56:25.385
I don't believe I get your drift.

2035
01:56:26.273 --> 01:56:30.198
I want something more than
I've ever wanted anything before.

2036
01:56:31.012 --> 01:56:33.537
I want to bring Mrs. Threadgoode...

2037
01:56:33.792 --> 01:56:35.441
to our home.

2038
01:56:36.085 --> 01:56:38.399
I want her to live here with us.

2039
01:56:38.825 --> 01:56:41.242
I want to give her the love
she's given me.

2040
01:56:42.370 --> 01:56:43.729
You're kidding me, aren't you?

2041
01:56:43.775 --> 01:56:45.828
I'm absolutely serious.

2042
01:56:46.076 --> 01:56:49.158
That's why I'm putting the wall
to Kyle's room back up.

2043
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:51.678
Well, honey.

2044
01:56:51.938 --> 01:56:54.413
This isn't something
you're just gonna do. I mean...

2045
01:56:54.506 --> 01:56:56.053
She's an old woman.

2046
01:56:56.385 --> 01:56:57.920
What if she got sick or something?

2047
01:56:57.967 --> 01:56:59.893
I mean, who, who's
gonna take care of her?

2048
01:56:59.929 --> 01:57:01.321
I will.

2049
01:57:01.476 --> 01:57:03.744
I can't leave her in that place.

2050
01:57:03.829 --> 01:57:07.200
She's not a stray cat or something.
Hell, she isn't even family.

2051
01:57:07.311 --> 01:57:09.981
- She's family to me.
- Now, Evelyn.

2052
01:57:11.427 --> 01:57:12.809
Evelyn.

2053
01:57:14.571 --> 01:57:15.950
Honey.

2054
01:57:16.527 --> 01:57:18.215
Uh, look.

2055
01:57:18.331 --> 01:57:20.309
Have, have, have you mentioned this...

2056
01:57:20.410 --> 01:57:22.911
harebrained idea of yours to her?

2057
01:57:22.958 --> 01:57:24.301
Not yet.

2058
01:57:24.364 --> 01:57:25.856
Well, good.

2059
01:57:25.991 --> 01:57:28.395
Then we'll just pretend
it never happened.

2060
01:57:28.450 --> 01:57:31.598
I'm making my own money now.
I'll pay for everything.

2061
01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:34.090
You don't have to do a thing.

2062
01:57:35.322 --> 01:57:36.793
Evelyn...

2063
01:57:38.319 --> 01:57:40.270
it's never gonna happen.

2064
01:57:40.321 --> 01:57:42.270
So, just forget about it.

2065
01:57:44.575 --> 01:57:47.323
Don't you ever say "never" to me.

2066
01:57:56.429 --> 01:57:59.105
Someone helped put a mirror up
in front of my face.

2067
01:57:59.195 --> 01:58:01.668
And I didn't like what I saw one bit.

2068
01:58:01.828 --> 01:58:03.480
And you know what I did?

2069
01:58:03.644 --> 01:58:05.347
I changed.

2070
01:58:05.872 --> 01:58:07.465
And that someone...

2071
01:58:07.543 --> 01:58:09.535
was Mrs. Threadgoode.

2072
01:58:09.738 --> 01:58:11.691
She needs my love and care now.

2073
01:58:11.729 --> 01:58:13.722
And I'm gonna give it to her.

2074
01:58:15.959 --> 01:58:18.938
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the gym.

2075
01:58:25.783 --> 01:58:27.673
And if you won't listen to reason,...

2076
01:58:27.731 --> 01:58:30.212
there's always Towanda.

2077
01:58:42.618 --> 01:58:44.282
I knew that.

2078
01:58:44.978 --> 01:58:46.126
<i>Listen.</i>

2079
01:58:46.171 --> 01:58:47.878
Hey, Nin--

2080
01:58:52.167 --> 01:58:54.058
What are you doing?

2081
01:58:54.801 --> 01:58:56.394
Those are her things.

2082
01:58:56.433 --> 01:58:57.909
Those are Mrs. Threadgoode's things.

2083
01:58:57.941 --> 01:58:59.933
What are you doing in here?
Where is Mrs. Threadgoode?

2084
01:58:59.967 --> 01:59:00.972
Who?

2085
01:59:01.006 --> 01:59:03.292
Mrs. Threadgoode,
the woman who lives here.

2086
01:59:03.324 --> 01:59:04.402
Are you deaf?

2087
01:59:04.433 --> 01:59:05.697
I'm sorry, miss.

2088
01:59:05.722 --> 01:59:06.896
All they told me was

2089
01:59:06.921 --> 01:59:09.546
that the woman who lived
in here died this morning.

2090
01:59:12.764 --> 01:59:14.622
Oh, my God.

2091
01:59:14.939 --> 01:59:16.364
What...

2092
01:59:17.531 --> 01:59:19.224
What are you saying?

2093
01:59:19.306 --> 01:59:21.521
<i>Well, she died early this morning.</i>

2094
01:59:21.597 --> 01:59:23.778
They were short-handed,
so they asked me to...

2095
01:59:23.818 --> 01:59:26.192
take all this stuff down.
That's all I know.

2096
01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:49.598
Stop that!

2097
01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:51.950
What is the matter with you people?

2098
01:59:52.300 --> 01:59:55.231
Can't you wait a goddamn day,
for Christ's sake?

2099
01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:57.270
Do you have no respect?

2100
01:59:57.309 --> 01:59:58.817
These are her things!

2101
01:59:58.863 --> 02:00:02.340
Well, I'm sorry, miss, but they told me
to get this room ready for another patient.

2102
02:00:02.373 --> 02:00:04.856
Well, she may be just
another patient to you,...

2103
02:00:04.911 --> 02:00:06.919
but she was my friend.

2104
02:00:06.975 --> 02:00:08.606
And I loved her.

2105
02:00:08.649 --> 02:00:09.933
Sorry.

2106
02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:11.379
I'm just following orders.

2107
02:00:11.418 --> 02:00:13.402
What is going on here?

2108
02:00:13.442 --> 02:00:14.848
Why didn't you call me?

2109
02:00:14.888 --> 02:00:16.450
You could have at least called me

2110
02:00:16.475 --> 02:00:18.456
- before you sent that idiot here.
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Couch.

2111
02:00:18.481 --> 02:00:21.348
It just never occurred to me
that you would take it this hard.

2112
02:00:21.376 --> 02:00:23.606
I didn't even get
to tell her goodbye.

2113
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:26.419
Oh, I know,
these things are difficult.

2114
02:00:26.450 --> 02:00:28.895
But, she died peacefully in her sleep.

2115
02:00:28.969 --> 02:00:32.575
And to tell the truth, I thought
you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.

2116
02:00:32.616 --> 02:00:34.168
- Happy?
- Why, yes.

2117
02:00:34.184 --> 02:00:37.207
- This is what she wanted.
- What, to be dead?

2118
02:00:37.268 --> 02:00:39.332
No, to go home.
You just missed her.

2119
02:00:39.373 --> 02:00:42.356
She left in a yellow cab
about a half-hour ago.

2120
02:00:42.475 --> 02:00:44.114
I don't understand.

2121
02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.468
What, a cab?

2122
02:00:45.522 --> 02:00:48.163
Well, yeah. She said there wasn't
no reason for her to stay

2123
02:00:48.195 --> 02:00:50.070
now that Mrs. Otis had died.

2124
02:00:50.183 --> 02:00:51.614
Mrs...

2125
02:00:52.411 --> 02:00:54.481
Otis is dead?

2126
02:00:55.665 --> 02:00:58.246
Wow, Mrs. Otis died.

2127
02:00:58.347 --> 02:01:00.393
Mrs. Otis died!

2128
02:01:00.439 --> 02:01:01.520
Mrs. Otis!

2129
02:01:01.559 --> 02:01:02.802
Oh, God!

2130
02:01:02.827 --> 02:01:03.981
Mrs. O--

2131
02:01:04.018 --> 02:01:06.528
Not that I'm,
I'm glad that Mrs. Otis died.

2132
02:01:06.553 --> 02:01:07.967
It's just--
Oh, God.

2133
02:01:08.024 --> 02:01:10.238
Oh, God.
I've got to stop her.

2134
02:01:10.277 --> 02:01:11.699
Oh.

2135
02:01:49.947 --> 02:01:51.254
Hey, Evelyn.

2136
02:01:51.317 --> 02:01:53.277
Somebody stole my house.

2137
02:01:53.421 --> 02:01:55.973
It was right here when I left.

2138
02:01:56.213 --> 02:01:57.449
Unless--

2139
02:01:57.519 --> 02:01:58.801
Oh, Evelyn.

2140
02:01:58.855 --> 02:02:01.496
You don't reckon
I'm crazy, do you?

2141
02:02:01.736 --> 02:02:03.613
It was here when I left.

2142
02:02:03.644 --> 02:02:05.559
No, honey, you're not crazy.

2143
02:02:05.605 --> 02:02:07.348
This is the place.

2144
02:02:08.238 --> 02:02:11.801
Well, why would anyone want
to steal an old lady's home?

2145
02:02:12.321 --> 02:02:14.223
It wasn't worth nothing.

2146
02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:15.856
Oh, honey.

2147
02:02:15.996 --> 02:02:17.863
Nobody stole it.

2148
02:02:18.004 --> 02:02:20.121
They had to tear it down.

2149
02:02:20.288 --> 02:02:22.129
It was condemned.

2150
02:02:22.525 --> 02:02:24.840
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

2151
02:02:24.926 --> 02:02:27.324
Well, somebody should have told me.

2152
02:02:27.519 --> 02:02:29.824
I'm old.
I'm, I'm not a child.

2153
02:02:29.869 --> 02:02:31.387
I'm sorry.

2154
02:02:32.465 --> 02:02:35.659
My husband, Cleo, and I
lived in this house for...

2155
02:02:35.862 --> 02:02:37.823
more than 40 years.

2156
02:02:38.328 --> 02:02:40.744
Now it's, it's gone.

2157
02:02:41.963 --> 02:02:44.532
83 years worth of living...

2158
02:02:44.607 --> 02:02:47.067
and all that's left of me
is what's in this box.

2159
02:02:47.128 --> 02:02:49.684
A bunch of old cards and pictures.

2160
02:02:49.887 --> 02:02:51.043
Come on.

2161
02:02:51.098 --> 02:02:52.184
I'll take you home.

2162
02:02:52.218 --> 02:02:54.082
This is my home!

2163
02:02:54.251 --> 02:02:55.965
And now it's gone.

2164
02:02:56.285 --> 02:02:58.738
And Mrs. Otis has gone.

2165
02:02:58.958 --> 02:03:00.442
Yeah.

2166
02:03:01.105 --> 02:03:03.613
I, I don't quite know
what to do. I...

2167
02:03:03.817 --> 02:03:07.996
This is the first time I can remember
when I don't have a soul to look after.

2168
02:03:08.195 --> 02:03:10.449
You can come look after me and Ed.

2169
02:03:10.536 --> 02:03:12.152
Oh, you're sweet.

2170
02:03:12.191 --> 02:03:15.606
But, I think you're doing
just fine on your own.

2171
02:03:15.844 --> 02:03:19.012
Don't you know
you'd be like a gift for us?

2172
02:03:19.831 --> 02:03:22.636
You're the reason
I get up every morning.

2173
02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:26.059
And that Mary Kay's having
such a good year.

2174
02:03:26.340 --> 02:03:30.606
And that I don't look like
some blob from a horror movie.

2175
02:03:31.044 --> 02:03:34.090
Well, with a little help
from Idgie and Ruth.

2176
02:03:35.137 --> 02:03:36.629
Come on.

2177
02:03:36.746 --> 02:03:39.067
I've got your room all ready.

2178
02:03:39.307 --> 02:03:41.762
What does Ed say about all this?

2179
02:03:41.873 --> 02:03:43.848
He'll learn to love it.

2180
02:03:49.138 --> 02:03:50.716
Did I ever tell you...

2181
02:03:50.841 --> 02:03:53.294
that Mrs. Otis was
Sipsey's baby sister?

2182
02:03:53.317 --> 02:03:55.544
- No, ma'am.
- Yes, she was.

2183
02:03:55.934 --> 02:03:59.809
Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey and me
the night Sipsey died.

2184
02:04:00.089 --> 02:04:05.286
Sipsey told me a story that night
I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.

2185
02:04:05.618 --> 02:04:08.302
<i>The story about what really happened...</i>

2186
02:04:08.411 --> 02:04:11.232
<i>the night Frank Bennett disappeared.</i>

2187
02:04:44.194 --> 02:04:45.545
- Hi, there.
- Miss Idgie,

2188
02:04:45.585 --> 02:04:47.124
you've got to come quick.

2189
02:04:47.742 --> 02:04:48.937
Well...

2190
02:04:48.987 --> 02:04:50.733
the show's hardly begun.

2191
02:04:50.871 --> 02:04:53.485
You've got to come quick now,
you hear me?

2192
02:04:58.570 --> 02:04:59.999
Run now and get help!

2193
02:05:00.039 --> 02:05:01.597
- Go get help, quick!
- Where's the baby?

2194
02:05:01.628 --> 02:05:03.188
- Run!
- Never mind.

2195
02:05:22.734 --> 02:05:24.508
Excuse me, sir.

2196
02:05:24.859 --> 02:05:28.523
I don't believe you should be
going anywhere with Ruth's baby.

2197
02:05:41.279 --> 02:05:43.685
Like I said,
you ain't going nowhere.

2198
02:05:43.724 --> 02:05:46.904
Damn, you're a thick-headed
son of a bitch, ain't you?

2199
02:05:51.792 --> 02:05:56.126
I told you you ain't going nowheres
with Miss Ruth's baby.

2200
02:06:02.453 --> 02:06:03.874
Come on, angel.

2201
02:06:03.906 --> 02:06:05.086
Come on.

2202
02:06:05.127 --> 02:06:06.781
Come on, sweetheart.

2203
02:06:06.880 --> 02:06:08.499
It's all right.

2204
02:06:08.828 --> 02:06:10.015
Come on.

2205
02:06:10.062 --> 02:06:11.960
It's all right, baby.

2206
02:06:14.741 --> 02:06:17.079
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

2207
02:06:17.581 --> 02:06:21.618
I don't know why any white jury
would care why I did it.

2208
02:06:21.796 --> 02:06:24.814
- Well, I saw it, and I can testify.
- Uh, excuse me here.

2209
02:06:24.858 --> 02:06:26.863
I don't mean no offense here.

2210
02:06:26.930 --> 02:06:30.064
But, I don't know who is less
likely to convince the jury,...

2211
02:06:30.111 --> 02:06:31.603
my mama...

2212
02:06:31.681 --> 02:06:33.545
or Mr. Smokey here.

2213
02:06:33.664 --> 02:06:35.431
No offense taken.

2214
02:06:35.941 --> 02:06:37.962
You're a good man, Mr. Smokey.

2215
02:06:38.014 --> 02:06:39.079
You did good.

2216
02:06:39.110 --> 02:06:41.228
The sun's almost up.

2217
02:06:45.368 --> 02:06:46.501
George?

2218
02:06:46.548 --> 02:06:47.899
Mmm-hmm.

2219
02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:51.118
I think...

2220
02:06:51.531 --> 02:06:53.977
it's hog-boiling time.

2221
02:06:55.131 --> 02:06:56.914
God, no, ma'am.

2222
02:06:56.968 --> 02:06:59.710
- It ain't cold enough.
- It's hog-boiling time.

2223
02:07:04.561 --> 02:07:06.443
- Hey, George?
- Uh-huh.

2224
02:07:06.481 --> 02:07:08.404
When is that barbecue
gonna be ready?

2225
02:07:08.442 --> 02:07:10.638
Oh, it's gonna be ready
any time now.

2226
02:07:10.779 --> 02:07:13.638
It smells so damn good.
I just can't wait to get me some.

2227
02:07:15.768 --> 02:07:18.193
Now, don't you forget to call me
when that's ready.

2228
02:07:18.233 --> 02:07:19.742
All right.

2229
02:07:33.704 --> 02:07:35.423
Here you go.

2230
02:07:37.652 --> 02:07:39.657
- Miss Idgie.
- Yeah.

2231
02:07:39.802 --> 02:07:41.658
Smokey left town.

2232
02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:44.697
I thought it'd be best
under the circumstances.

2233
02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:48.072
He asked that
you tell Ruth goodbye.

2234
02:07:49.464 --> 02:07:51.541
Shame he had to go.

2235
02:08:00.881 --> 02:08:02.366
Hold on!

2236
02:08:02.475 --> 02:08:04.077
I'm coming.

2237
02:08:08.774 --> 02:08:09.844
What you want?

2238
02:08:09.883 --> 02:08:11.399
We want some barbecue.

2239
02:08:11.430 --> 02:08:12.852
Oh, not today, you don't.

2240
02:08:12.884 --> 02:08:14.259
Go on, now.

2241
02:08:28.879 --> 02:08:32.143
Why, this is about
the best barbecue I ever ate.

2242
02:08:33.644 --> 02:08:35.769
The secret's in the sauce.

2243
02:08:45.252 --> 02:08:46.904
Sipsey?

2244
02:08:47.341 --> 02:08:48.935
My God.

2245
02:08:49.008 --> 02:08:52.693
That frying pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

2246
02:08:53.928 --> 02:08:55.264
Oh.

2247
02:08:55.326 --> 02:08:58.201
Did Idgie really barbecue
Frank Bennett?

2248
02:08:58.269 --> 02:08:59.889
Oh, you're pulling my leg.

2249
02:08:59.930 --> 02:09:03.060
Secret's in the sauce,
or so I've been told.

2250
02:09:06.937 --> 02:09:10.572
Now you know why
Idgie had to go on trial.

2251
02:09:10.875 --> 02:09:13.291
She knew the law would
never believe Sipsey.

2252
02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:14.456
No!

2253
02:09:14.518 --> 02:09:17.283
Sipsey or Big George
or anyone else of colour

2254
02:09:17.315 --> 02:09:19.237
would have been hanging
from the nearest tree.

2255
02:09:19.275 --> 02:09:20.478
Mmm.

2256
02:09:20.697 --> 02:09:21.885
To this day,

2257
02:09:21.925 --> 02:09:25.620
I'm still not sure whether
Ruth ever believed that...

2258
02:09:25.719 --> 02:09:28.557
Idgie didn't kill Frank Bennett.

2259
02:09:29.839 --> 02:09:32.761
Truth's a funny thing sometimes.

2260
02:09:34.878 --> 02:09:36.456
I feel better now.

2261
02:09:36.501 --> 02:09:37.846
Good.

2262
02:09:38.207 --> 02:09:41.526
I feel better because
all these people will live...

2263
02:09:41.628 --> 02:09:43.815
as long as you remember them.

2264
02:09:44.742 --> 02:09:46.483
You reminded me...

2265
02:09:46.655 --> 02:09:49.921
about what the most
important thing in life is.

2266
02:09:50.225 --> 02:09:52.436
- You know what I think it is?
- No, ma'am.

2267
02:09:52.585 --> 02:09:53.905
Friends.

2268
02:09:54.032 --> 02:09:55.577
Best friends.

2269
02:09:55.917 --> 02:09:57.960
Oh, Ninny.

2270
02:10:00.617 --> 02:10:02.016
Look.

2271
02:10:07.015 --> 02:10:08.492
Oh.

2272
02:10:29.078 --> 02:10:30.617
Idgie?

2273
02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:35.563
Idgie's alive?

2274
02:10:36.375 --> 02:10:37.781
Oh, yes.

2275
02:10:37.836 --> 02:10:41.627
She's still out and about,
charming bees and selling honey.

2276
02:10:41.851 --> 02:10:45.031
Sometimes, I think
I catch a glimpse of her.

2277
02:10:52.277 --> 02:10:54.483
Maybe, we'll see her today.

2278
02:10:54.888 --> 02:10:56.272
Maybe.

2279
02:10:58.634 --> 02:11:00.074
Let's go.

2280
02:11:13.074 --> 02:11:16.973
<i>After Ruth died and
the rail road stopped running,...</i>

2281
02:11:17.121 --> 02:11:21.817
<i>the cafÃ© shut down and
everybody just scattered to the winds.</i>

2282
02:11:22.463 --> 02:11:25.746
<i>It was never more than
just a little knockabout place.</i>

2283
02:11:25.879 --> 02:11:28.535
<i>But now that I look back on it,...</i>

2284
02:11:28.746 --> 02:11:31.002
<i>when that cafÃ© closed,...</i>

2285
02:11:31.082 --> 02:11:34.199
<i>the heart of the town
just stopped beating.</i>

2286
02:11:35.266 --> 02:11:38.129
<i>It's funny how a little place like this...</i>

2287
02:11:38.223 --> 02:11:41.262
<i>brought so many people together.</i>

2288
02:12:37.227 --> 02:12:40.514
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2289
02:12:42.626 --> 02:12:46.899
âª <i>When I've forgotten all the rest</i> âª

2290
02:12:49.747 --> 02:12:53.684
âª <i>You to me were true</i> âª

2291
02:12:55.770 --> 02:12:59.825
âª <i>You to me were the best</i> âª

2292
02:13:00.622 --> 02:13:03.427
âª <i>When there is no more</i> âª

2293
02:13:04.044 --> 02:13:06.880
âª <i>You cut to the core</i> âª

2294
02:13:08.208 --> 02:13:12.677
âª <i>Quicker than anyone that I knew</i> âª

2295
02:13:13.255 --> 02:13:16.888
âª <i>Now when the roses fade</i> âª

2296
02:13:17.187 --> 02:13:21.083
âª <i>And I'm in the shade, baby</i> âª

2297
02:13:21.489 --> 02:13:24.833
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2298
02:13:26.684 --> 02:13:27.936
âª <i>Didn't I?</i> âª

2299
02:13:28.015 --> 02:13:29.062
âª <i>Didn't I?</i> âª

2300
02:13:29.110 --> 02:13:31.233
âª <i>Didn't I love you?</i> âª

2301
02:13:31.273 --> 02:13:33.242
âª <i>Didn't I love you, baby?</i> âª

2302
02:13:33.288 --> 02:13:35.358
âª <i>Didn't I?</i> âª

2303
02:13:35.421 --> 02:13:38.804
âª <i>Didn't I care?</i> âª

2304
02:13:39.507 --> 02:13:41.030
âª <i>Didn't I sleep</i> âª

2305
02:13:41.093 --> 02:13:44.132
âª <i>And didn't I weep beside you?</i> âª

2306
02:13:44.202 --> 02:13:45.679
âª <i>Oh, yes, you did</i> âª

2307
02:13:45.717 --> 02:13:48.516
âª With a rain that was blowing

2308
02:13:48.626 --> 02:13:51.040
âª <i>In your hair</i> âª

2309
02:13:51.111 --> 02:13:54.001
âª <i>Oh oh oh oh</i> âª

2310
02:13:54.204 --> 02:13:57.345
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2311
02:13:58.368 --> 02:14:00.641
âª <i>When the wind blows</i> âª

2312
02:14:00.697 --> 02:14:03.775
âª <i>On through the piny wood</i> âª

2313
02:14:03.853 --> 02:14:06.181
âª <i>Oh oh oh oh</i> âª

2314
02:14:06.251 --> 02:14:09.516
âª <i>It was you who came right through</i> âª

2315
02:14:09.634 --> 02:14:12.267
âª <i>For me, baby</i> âª

2316
02:14:12.727 --> 02:14:16.282
âª <i>It was you who understood</i> âª

2317
02:14:17.501 --> 02:14:19.384
âª <i>Though I'd never say</i> âª

2318
02:14:19.439 --> 02:14:20.892
âª <i>I'd never say</i> âª

2319
02:14:20.938 --> 02:14:23.269
âª <i>That I've earned the way</i> âª

2320
02:14:23.301 --> 02:14:25.402
âª <i>Oh oh oh oh</i> âª

2321
02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:28.890
âª <i>That you have led me to</i> âª

2322
02:14:28.966 --> 02:14:30.583
âª <i>Oh oh oh oh</i> âª

2323
02:14:30.614 --> 02:14:33.841
âª <i>Darling, in the end</i> âª

2324
02:14:34.403 --> 02:14:36.325
âª <i>My dear sweet friend</i> âª

2325
02:14:36.364 --> 02:14:38.318
âª <i>Sweet friend</i> âª

2326
02:14:38.497 --> 02:14:41.449
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2327
02:14:41.757 --> 02:14:43.546
âª <i>Yes, I will, now</i> âª

2328
02:14:43.601 --> 02:14:45.531
âª <i>I will, now</i> âª

2329
02:14:45.593 --> 02:14:48.218
âª <i>- I'll remember you âª
âª - I'll remember</i> âª

2330
02:14:48.272 --> 02:14:50.952
âª <i>- Yes, I will, now âª
âª - I'll remember you</i> âª

2331
02:14:52.834 --> 02:14:54.749
âª <i>I'll remember</i> âª

2332
02:14:56.050 --> 02:14:58.017
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2333
02:14:58.498 --> 02:15:00.503
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2334
02:15:00.633 --> 02:15:02.011
âª <i>Yes, I will</i> âª

2335
02:15:03.447 --> 02:15:05.744
âª <i>Help me out</i> âª

2336
02:15:07.190 --> 02:15:09.393
âª <i>Don't matter what happens</i> âª

2337
02:15:09.791 --> 02:15:12.643
âª <i>Time ain't gonna change nothing, baby</i> âª

2338
02:15:13.674 --> 02:15:16.338
âª <i>We could be halfway across âª
âª the world from each other</i> âª

2339
02:15:16.908 --> 02:15:19.252
âª <i>It don't make no difference</i> âª

2340
02:15:20.322 --> 02:15:22.268
âª <i>I'll remember</i> âª

2341
02:15:22.323 --> 02:15:24.088
âª <i>I'll remember</i> âª

2342
02:15:25.283 --> 02:15:26.760
âª <i>I'll remember</i> âª

2343
02:15:26.807 --> 02:15:29.651
âª <i>Every hour, every second</i> âª

2344
02:15:29.862 --> 02:15:31.630
âª <i>Every moment that we had</i> âª

2345
02:15:31.691 --> 02:15:34.458
âª <i>We do it, we do it</i> âª

2346
02:15:35.462 --> 02:15:38.700
âª <i>We do it don't do it</i> âª

2347
02:15:38.749 --> 02:15:40.231
âª <i>Gonna do it</i> âª

2348
02:15:40.294 --> 02:15:42.224
âª <i>Do it, do it, do it</i> âª

2349
02:15:42.304 --> 02:15:46.247
âª <i>Do it, do it, do it, do it, âª
âª do it, do it, do it</i> âª

2350
02:15:46.442 --> 02:15:48.148
âª <i>I'll remember</i> âª

2351
02:15:48.203 --> 02:15:49.680
âª <i>I'll remember</i> âª

2352
02:15:49.726 --> 02:15:52.757
âª <i>Oh, I'll remember you</i> âª

2353
02:15:52.908 --> 02:15:57.617
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2354
02:15:57.679 --> 02:16:01.962
âª <i>Oh oh oh oh</i> âª

2355
02:16:02.494 --> 02:16:04.861
âª <i>I'll remember you</i> âª

2356
02:16:05.044 --> 02:16:07.330
âª <i>Yes, I will</i> âª
