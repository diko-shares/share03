1
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.432
Yes, ma'am, how ya doin'?

2
00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:52.400
Is this Rose Hill?

3
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.435
Good, This is Ed Couch.

4
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.946
I'm Vesta Adcock's nephew.

5
00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:00.244
I need to get up there
and see her,

6
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:04.310
but I'm gonna be late
'cause I'm lost out here.

7
00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:06.856
We're off the Alabama interstate
but I don't know where.

8
00:03:43.281 --> 00:03:47.195
- Did you hear that?
- What?

9
00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:49.323
The train.

10
00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:52.266
No, I didn't hear
no train.

11
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.369
Oh, nothin',
I guess.

12
00:03:56.428 --> 00:04:00.843
- Where's "Whistle Stop" on the map?
- I can't find it.

13
00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:04.779
Why did you tell me to
turn right 10 miles back there?

14
00:04:06.304 --> 00:04:09.842
God, you got a negative
sense of direction, hon.

15
00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:12.787
I'm sorry.

16
00:04:12.844 --> 00:04:17.054
Oh, Ed,your aunt's gonna be
so disappointed we're late.

17
00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:21.120
I know she's been looking forward
to this visit all week long.

18
00:04:21.186 --> 00:04:24.463
Bless her sweet,
little ol' heart.

19
00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:31.472
Hey, how's my sweet Auntie V
this afternoon?

20
00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:34.135
Remember us?

21
00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.271
- Don't you look pretty!
- We brought you something.

22
00:04:37.335 --> 00:04:40.509
- Let me look at you.

23
00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.178
Don't you know
Evelyn loves you?

24
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:48.088
Well, honey, I guess it'd be
better if you wait out here for me.

25
00:04:48.146 --> 00:04:52.617
- I'll get all this stuff.
- Well, if you think it's best.

26
00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:55.995
Yeah, I do this time.
Okay?

27
00:04:56.054 --> 00:04:58.227
Have a nice day,
Aunt Vesta.

28
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.236
Don't you pitch a fit
like that'

29
00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:14.911
Did you know
they took my gallbladder out?

30
00:05:16.341 --> 00:05:18.480
No, I didn't.

31
00:05:18.543 --> 00:05:22.218
Oh, yes. Still
in the hospital in ajar.

32
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.093
I guess that's where
they keep 'em.

33
00:05:27.152 --> 00:05:29.132
I guess.

34
00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:31.428
When I was
in the hospital,

35
00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:35.460
the nurse gave me one of them
Fleet enemas they're so fond of.

36
00:05:35.527 --> 00:05:38.133
Mrs. Cleo Threadgoode,

37
00:05:38.196 --> 00:05:41.507
82 year old widow,
imagine that.

38
00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:44.706
Actually,
everybody calls me Ninny.

39
00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:47.010
'Course I'm
just visitin' here.

40
00:05:47.072 --> 00:05:52.351
Did you ever have
one of them Fleet enemas?

41
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.356
Um,well?

42
00:05:54.412 --> 00:05:56.483
No.

43
00:05:56.548 --> 00:05:59.791
You'd remember it.

44
00:05:59.851 --> 00:06:03.526
Me and my friend, Mrs. Otis,
come from Whistle Stop.

45
00:06:03.588 --> 00:06:05.795
You ever been
to Whistle Stop?

46
00:06:05.857 --> 00:06:09.270
Why, yes. I just
passed by there today.

47
00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:14.208
She's lived down the street
from me for 30 years or more.

48
00:06:14.265 --> 00:06:16.267
After her son died,

49
00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:19.941
her daughter-in-law had a fit for
her to come live at the nursing home.

50
00:06:20.004 --> 00:06:23.315
They asked me to come
and be her roommate.

51
00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:27.619
Mrs. Otis don't know it, but I'm going
home just soon as she gets settled in good.

52
00:06:29.948 --> 00:06:33.361
Does the name "Idgie
Threadgoode" ring a bell?

53
00:06:33.418 --> 00:06:36.956
Um, no, ma'am.
I don't think so.

54
00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.831
You'd remember her.

55
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:43.805
You see, I was practically
adopted by the Threadgoode family.

56
00:06:43.862 --> 00:06:46.206
- I married her brother, Cleo.
- Oh, uh-huh.

57
00:06:46.264 --> 00:06:51.043
Idgie and her friend Ruth,
ran the Whistle Stop Cafe.

58
00:06:51.102 --> 00:06:53.048
Oh.

59
00:06:53.104 --> 00:06:55.812
Idgie was a character,
all right.

60
00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:59.219
But how anybody
could've thought...

61
00:06:59.277 --> 00:07:03.316
she murdered that man
is beyond me.

62
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.361
I beg your pardon?

63
00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:08.990
You sit and relax a while.
I'll tell you all about it.

64
00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:11.693
Oh, now, let's see.

65
00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:15.226
I 'member the day they pulled
that truck up out of the river.

66
00:07:15.293 --> 00:07:19.264
That same rainy
summer day...

67
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.279
Idgie Threadgoode was arrested for
the murder of the owner of that truck,

68
00:07:24.335 --> 00:07:27.316
Frank Bennett.

69
00:07:29.607 --> 00:07:32.053
I guess,
to understand Idgie,

70
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.819
you'd have to start way back
with her brother, Buddy.

71
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.829
Idgie was Buddy's pet
from the day she was born.

72
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:46.998
I 'member the day we was all
gettin' ready for Leona's weddin'.

73
00:07:47.058 --> 00:07:49.038
The war had just ended,

74
00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:51.437
the Great one,
you know.

75
00:07:51.496 --> 00:07:56.172
And another one was about to
begin in the Threadgoode house.

76
00:07:56.234 --> 00:07:58.680
Sipsey hone )4
is that finished?

77
00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:03.185
- Buddy, get dressed honey.
- Mama?

78
00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:05.221
Leona, what is it?

79
00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.153
Idgie's upstairs
in her room...

80
00:08:07.212 --> 00:08:09.192
and says she won't come out
as long as she lives.

81
00:08:09.247 --> 00:08:11.386
- She is gonna ruin my weddin'!
- Shh.

82
00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.259
Leona, you're gonna be
the most beautiful bride.

83
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:17.596
Of course she is, Papa.

84
00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:21.603
Your papa has spent every last
nickel he has just to make you happy.

85
00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:25.471
Now, you try to act
a little grateful, young lady.

86
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.636
Imogene Louise Threadgoode!

87
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.237
This is your mama!

88
00:08:33.638 --> 00:08:38.587
You come down here right now.
Do you hear me?

89
00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:41.283
- Buddy, fetch her. She'll listen to you.
- Come on down, little bit.

90
00:08:41.346 --> 00:08:43.917
There's no firin'
squad waitin' for you.

91
00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:49.330
Ohh! Come on, honey
Let us see you.

92
00:08:49.387 --> 00:08:51.560
You look so pretty.

93
00:08:51.623 --> 00:08:54.467
- I see London,
I see- - Hush!

94
00:08:56.194 --> 00:08:59.641
Julian, hush.

95
00:08:59.697 --> 00:09:02.439
Come ahead, sweetheart.

96
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.243
You look awful nice
in that.

97
00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:07.908
- Mama!
- You look fine.

98
00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:10.475
She looks like a monkey

99
00:09:10.542 --> 00:09:12.351
Julian, stop it
right this second!

100
00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.755
Take it back! Take it back! Idgie, hey!

101
00:09:15.813 --> 00:09:18.919
I told you she
was gonna ruin my weddin'!

102
00:09:18.983 --> 00:09:21.361
- Idgie, get up.
- Take it back!

103
00:09:21.419 --> 00:09:23.592
Take it back!

104
00:09:23.655 --> 00:09:27.000
- I'll get you for this.
- No, Buddy.

105
00:09:30.795 --> 00:09:33.867
We have to be careful
when she's dressing up.

106
00:09:33.932 --> 00:09:35.878
She's just a pain!

107
00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:39.472
Leona, will you
stop shrieking'

108
00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:42.245
This is your
weddin ' day'

109
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:56.095
I oaks like you got yourself
up a tree, little bit.

110
00:09:56.154 --> 00:09:59.192
I'm sick of people
makin' fun of me.

111
00:09:59.257 --> 00:10:01.794
So you're gonna stay up here
all day long.

112
00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:05.068
Yep.
The hell with them.

113
00:10:05.129 --> 00:10:09.077
Who wants to wear
that stupid ol' dress anyway?

114
00:10:09.133 --> 00:10:12.512
- I ever tell you about the oysters?
- Oysters?

115
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.516
- I tell you about the oysters?
- No.

116
00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:19.248
Think about the millions of
oysters lyin' around the ocean.

117
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.654
Then one day...

118
00:10:21.713 --> 00:10:24.523
God comes along and sees one
and he says,

119
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.495
"I think I'm gonna make
that one different."

120
00:10:27.552 --> 00:10:29.759
You know what he does?

121
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:32.995
He puts a little
piece of sand in it.

122
00:10:33.057 --> 00:10:37.301
- Guess what it can do that the others can't.
- What?

123
00:10:37.362 --> 00:10:40.673
It can make
a beautiful pearl.

124
00:10:40.732 --> 00:10:42.905
What if God
made a mistake?

125
00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:48.076
Well, the way I figure it,
he never makes mistakes.

126
00:10:48.139 --> 00:10:50.915
I mean, he made sure
we got together.

127
00:10:50.975 --> 00:10:52.977
He made sure you got
the best looking,

128
00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:55.251
most charmin' brother
in the world...

129
00:10:55.313 --> 00:10:58.692
- who's gonna beat you to the chocolate cake.
- You will not.

130
00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.128
Got you out of the tree,
didn't I?

131
00:11:01.185 --> 00:11:04.132
Did not!

132
00:11:04.188 --> 00:11:07.829
Into this estate,
these two come now to be joined

133
00:11:07.892 --> 00:11:09.997
If any man present
can show cause...

134
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:12.473
why they may not lawfully
be joined together,

135
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:17.673
let him speak now or
forever after hold his peace.

136
00:11:17.735 --> 00:11:20.409
Please be seated.

137
00:11:22.774 --> 00:11:24.981
If either of you
know any reason...

138
00:11:25.043 --> 00:11:28.024
why you may not justly be
joined together in holy matrimony

139
00:11:28.079 --> 00:11:30.559
do you now confess it?

140
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:42.899
It is then your will
to proceed.

141
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.669
Do you,
Charles Osgood justice-

142
00:11:52.503 --> 00:11:55.848
Thank you. I don't know what
we'd do without your generosity.

143
00:11:55.907 --> 00:11:58.888
Sipsey, especially you.
Look what you've clone!

144
00:11:58.943 --> 00:12:02.891
Thank you, Mrs. Threadgoode.
Gimme that, you rascal!

145
00:12:07.218 --> 00:12:09.789
John!
Jump on my back

146
00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:13.495
I don't think there ever was a
sweeter boy than Buddy Threadgoode.

147
00:12:13.558 --> 00:12:18.064
- You look beautiful, Lily.
- Yes, Lily, you sure do.

148
00:12:18.129 --> 00:12:21.576
I had the biggest crush
on him.

149
00:12:21.632 --> 00:12:23.976
He was a terrible flirt!

150
00:12:24.035 --> 00:12:27.278
But his heart belonged
to Ruth Jamison.

151
00:12:27.338 --> 00:12:30.512
She was the daughter of
a friend of his mama's...

152
00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:33.385
who was visitin'
that summer.

153
00:12:33.444 --> 00:12:36.914
Ruth Jamison, you're just
the one I've been lookin' for.

154
00:12:36.981 --> 00:12:40.087
- Are you thirsty?
- Let's go visit someplace else.

155
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.335
Think that's a big lake, you should've
seen the one next to our house.

156
00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:51.532
We used to swim in it
and fish.

157
00:12:51.596 --> 00:12:54.270
I sure do miss it.
Sure do.

158
00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:57.074
What happened to it?
Did it dry up?

159
00:12:57.135 --> 00:12:59.081
No, worse than that.

160
00:12:59.137 --> 00:13:01.208
Last fall, a flock of ducks,

161
00:13:01.272 --> 00:13:05.550
40 or 50 of 'em, landed right
smack in the middle of it.

162
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.487
This fluke thing
happened.

163
00:13:07.545 --> 00:13:10.025
The temperature dropped so fast
that the whole lake froze...

164
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.083
in three seconds,
just like that!

165
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.460
Those poor little ducks.
Did it kill them?

166
00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:17.728
No, they flew off
and took the lake with 'em.

167
00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:21.168
To this very day, that lake
is somewhere over in Georgia.

168
00:13:21.225 --> 00:13:24.672
Buddy Threadgoode.

169
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.985
Come a little closer.
I wanna give you something.

170
00:13:39.043 --> 00:13:41.489
Come here.

171
00:13:45.349 --> 00:13:47.590
Whoop!

172
00:13:51.722 --> 00:13:55.135
Come back here, hat. Where
do you think you're gain'?

173
00:13:57.361 --> 00:13:59.307
Whoa!

174
00:13:59.363 --> 00:14:02.469
I got it. Hold on, Ruth.
Hold on, little bit.

175
00:14:06.871 --> 00:14:09.613
It's all right.
I got it.

176
00:14:11.742 --> 00:14:15.485
Come here, you damn hat. Got it!

177
00:14:15.546 --> 00:14:18.493
Oh, I meant
to do that.

178
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.293
I... got it!

179
00:14:23.354 --> 00:14:25.231
Ta-da!

180
00:14:27.024 --> 00:14:29.561
All right.
Damn!

181
00:14:29.627 --> 00:14:31.607
Come on.

182
00:14:38.236 --> 00:14:43.117
Come on. Get out.
Get out.

183
00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.120
Buddy!

184
00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:48.419
- Buddy!
- Buddy Threadgoode!

185
00:14:50.047 --> 00:14:51.754
Come on, Buddy!

186
00:14:51.816 --> 00:14:53.557
Get out.

187
00:14:55.019 --> 00:14:57.158
Get out of there.

188
00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:02.301
Buddy!

189
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.500
- Come on, Buddy!
- Buddy'

190
00:15:05.563 --> 00:15:08.169
Buddy!

191
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.307
No-o-o!

192
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:17.217
Buddy!

193
00:15:17.275 --> 00:15:20.688
Buddy, no!
No!

194
00:15:20.745 --> 00:15:23.521
No! Buddy!
No-o-o!

195
00:15:23.581 --> 00:15:26.619
No! Buddy!
Let me go!

196
00:15:28.085 --> 00:15:31.897
' No!
- Buddy!

197
00:15:31.956 --> 00:15:35.597
- You got to go back to the house.

198
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:38.163
Come on.
We're gonna go home.

199
00:15:38.229 --> 00:15:41.073
- Buddy!
- You have to be strong.

200
00:15:41.132 --> 00:15:44.045
- It'll be okay.
- Buddy!

201
00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:47.048
"The Lord is my Shepherd,

202
00:15:47.104 --> 00:15:49.311
I shall not want."

203
00:15:49.373 --> 00:15:52.377
Oh, it like
to have killed us all

204
00:15:52.443 --> 00:15:55.117
But nary a one took it
as hard as Idgie,

205
00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:03.688
everyone thought she 'o' die
right along with him.

206
00:16:20.338 --> 00:16:24.616
Night alter night,
she stayed by the river.

207
00:16:24.675 --> 00:16:28.851
Big George was the only soul
she'd let near her,

208
00:16:28.913 --> 00:16:32.451
and he watched over her
night and day

209
00:16:32.516 --> 00:16:35.326
You know,
a heart can be broken,

210
00:16:35.386 --> 00:16:38.458
but it still keeps a-beatin'
just the same.

211
00:16:38.522 --> 00:16:41.162
Miss Idgie, you'll have
to keep this blanket on...

212
00:16:41.225 --> 00:16:44.138
or you'll catch your death
of cold, you hear me now?

213
00:16:44.195 --> 00:16:48.610
That's so sad.

214
00:16:54.005 --> 00:16:56.611
Ah.

215
00:16:56.674 --> 00:16:58.676
Would you like
one of these?

216
00:16:58.743 --> 00:17:00.745
Oh, thank ya,
honey.

217
00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:02.688
Evelyn?

218
00:17:02.747 --> 00:17:04.920
Honey,
we gotta get goin'.

219
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:07.394
The Braves' game's
fixin' to start...

220
00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:09.089
and you're gonna miss
your... thing.

221
00:17:09.153 --> 00:17:12.896
Excuse me.
That's my husband, Ed.

222
00:17:12.957 --> 00:17:15.028
Hi, ma'am.
How you doin'?

223
00:17:15.092 --> 00:17:18.539
Um.

224
00:17:18.596 --> 00:17:20.667
I can't believe
Buddy died.

225
00:17:20.731 --> 00:17:23.337
Neither could I.

226
00:17:23.401 --> 00:17:26.814
Oh, well, I enjoyed
talkin' to you, honey.

227
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:28.873
What's your name?

228
00:17:28.939 --> 00:17:32.011
Evelyn...
Evelyn Couch.

229
00:17:32.076 --> 00:17:36.855
- I've got to go.
- You come back and see me, you hear?

230
00:17:36.914 --> 00:17:40.828
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

231
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:43.294
First of all,
I want you...

232
00:17:43.354 --> 00:17:45.960
to truly
dedicate yourselves...

233
00:17:46.023 --> 00:17:50.062
to finding little ways to
putting that magic, that spark...

234
00:17:50.127 --> 00:17:52.334
back into your marriage.

235
00:17:52.396 --> 00:17:56.344
When we think of
romance and marriage,

236
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.439
- what is the first thought that comes into your mind?
- Divorce!

237
00:18:00.504 --> 00:18:04.213
Remember when counselors used to tell
you to wrap yourself in cellophane...

238
00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:06.482
to put a little charge
into your marriage?

239
00:18:06.544 --> 00:18:09.354
Do we really pay
for these lectures?

240
00:18:09.413 --> 00:18:12.121
You can see,
it is truly up to you...

241
00:18:12.183 --> 00:18:15.687
to put romance back
into your relationship.

242
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.360
Evelyn,
have you gone insane?

243
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:47.362
My God
people can see you!

244
00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:49.489
What if I had been
the paperboy?

245
00:18:49.553 --> 00:18:51.328
Get in there!

246
00:18:51.388 --> 00:18:54.198
What are you
thinking about?

247
00:18:54.992 --> 00:18:58.337
Evelyn?

248
00:18:58.395 --> 00:19:00.705
- Evelyn!
- Oh.

249
00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:04.735
You know, what we really need
instead of this baloney...

250
00:19:04.802 --> 00:19:08.875
is an assertiveness training
class for Southern women.

251
00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:12.512
But that's a contradiction
in terms, isn't it?

252
00:19:12.576 --> 00:19:15.819
Especially you, sweetheart.
You're livin' in the Dark Ages.

253
00:19:39.069 --> 00:19:41.675
- Hi, honey. I need one of those.
- Hi!

254
00:19:41.739 --> 00:19:44.515
Mmm, you smell good too.

255
00:19:44.575 --> 00:19:46.612
I need one of these.

256
00:19:46.677 --> 00:19:49.624
- Oh, this looks good!
- Uh-huh.

257
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.626
Yes, indeedy.

258
00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:03.772
Ed.

259
00:20:05.462 --> 00:20:07.635
Why don't you come in?
and sit down at the table...

260
00:20:07.698 --> 00:20:11.646
- and have dinner with me?
- I'm sorry. The game's almost over.

261
00:20:11.702 --> 00:20:14.546
I just want to see a little bit
of it. Why you so dressed up?

262
00:20:14.605 --> 00:20:17.108
Honey, don't get in the way.
Scoot over a bit.

263
00:20:21.245 --> 00:20:22.815
Ed?

264
00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.884
If I'd answered the door
wearing only cellophane,

265
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.261
would you still be
watching the baseball game?

266
00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:33.063
No, honey. I'd probably be
checking you into a looney bin.

267
00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:59.623
Hi, sugar.

268
00:20:59.683 --> 00:21:01.629
- How's my dumplin'?
- Trick or treat!

269
00:21:01.685 --> 00:21:03.631
You 're not gonna throw
them hissy-fits, are you?

270
00:21:03.687 --> 00:21:06.930
Happy Halloween!
Oh, no. No, no, no!

271
00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:09.096
You 're meaner
than a damn snake.

272
00:21:09.159 --> 00:21:11.161
I'm glad
you're feeling better.

273
00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:14.471
- Get back in bed
- Good thing your eyesight's failing.

274
00:21:24.108 --> 00:21:27.248
- Hey!
- Mmm. Oh.

275
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:30.724
- Hey.
- I was hopin' you'd be here.

276
00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:34.854
My roommate, Mrs. Otis,
said I could visit her family,

277
00:21:34.918 --> 00:21:36.864
but I said,
"Thank you kindly,

278
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.560
but I think I might have
my own visitor."

279
00:21:39.623 --> 00:21:41.625
And here you are.

280
00:21:41.692 --> 00:21:43.968
- Well, sit down.
- Thank you.

281
00:21:44.028 --> 00:21:47.566
And doughnuts to boot!
You can't beat that.

282
00:21:47.631 --> 00:21:50.475
- Well, help yourself, Mrs. Threadgoode.
- Thank you.

283
00:21:51.201 --> 00:21:52.236
How's your friend?

284
00:21:52.303 --> 00:21:54.305
- Mrs. Otis?
- Uh-huh.

285
00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:57.318
- Well, not so good.
- Oh.

286
00:21:57.374 --> 00:22:00.116
Looks like I won't be
gettin' home for quite a while,

287
00:22:00.177 --> 00:22:03.624
and I sure miss it.

288
00:22:03.681 --> 00:22:06.958
Funny what you miss
when you're away from home.

289
00:22:07.017 --> 00:22:09.429
I miss
the smell of coffee...

290
00:22:09.486 --> 00:22:12.296
and bacon fryin'.

291
00:22:12.356 --> 00:22:16.862
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a
plate of fried green tomatoes...

292
00:22:16.927 --> 00:22:19.635
like we used to have
at the cafe.

293
00:22:19.697 --> 00:22:22.109
Ooh!

294
00:22:25.636 --> 00:22:28.708
I never told you about the cafe, did I?

295
00:22:28.772 --> 00:22:30.718
No, ma'am.

296
00:22:30.774 --> 00:22:35.382
Oh, well...
now let me back up a bit.

297
00:22:35.446 --> 00:22:40.691
You see, Idgie never
quite got over losing Buddy.

298
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.092
She hardly
ever come home.

299
00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:49.035
Only Big George
knew how to find her.

300
00:22:49.093 --> 00:22:53.838
She just didn't seem to care
about anythin' anymore.

301
00:22:53.897 --> 00:22:55.843
Then, one summer day

302
00:22:55.899 --> 00:22:58.880
her mama sent for her.

303
00:22:58.936 --> 00:23:00.882
Like they say

304
00:23:00.938 --> 00:23:04.442
God never shuts one door
without opening another.

305
00:23:04.508 --> 00:23:08.149
- That was also the day Idgie met Frank Bennett,
- Mama!

306
00:23:08.212 --> 00:23:10.954
The man whose murder
got her arrested

307
00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:15.053
Well, hello there, miss.
And who might you be?

308
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.623
Towanda to you.
Who are you?

309
00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:22.933
Oh, Frank Bennett's
the name, Miss Towanda.

310
00:23:22.993 --> 00:23:26.998
I must say you are lookin'
mighty fine today.

311
00:23:27.064 --> 00:23:29.066
You a politician...

312
00:23:29.133 --> 00:23:32.342
or does lying
just run in your family?

313
00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.344
Mama!

314
00:23:36.407 --> 00:23:38.284
Well, there you are!

315
00:23:38.342 --> 00:23:41.346
Well, it's about time,
Idgie.

316
00:23:44.148 --> 00:23:47.061
If you don't look like
the wild man of Borneo.

317
00:23:47.117 --> 00:23:50.724
- Here you go.
- Well, thank you.

318
00:23:50.788 --> 00:23:53.132
Guess who's here?
Who?

319
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:55.864
Ruth. She's stayin'
with us this summer...

320
00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:59.339
and will be in charge of all the young
people's activities at the church.

321
00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:04.175
- Is that why you wanted to see me?
- We have so many things planned.

322
00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:06.373
Ruth?

323
00:24:06.437 --> 00:24:09.941
- You remember my youngest child?
- Of course I do.

324
00:24:10.007 --> 00:24:11.953
Hi, Idgie.

325
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.013
Hi.

326
00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:22.792
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

327
00:24:22.853 --> 00:24:25.424
Oh, it's got to work.

328
00:24:25.489 --> 00:24:28.993
Somebody's got to help her. I can't.

329
00:24:29.693 --> 00:24:33.368
Are you sure you want to go
to this river club, Miss Ruth?

330
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.376
These ain't no
churchgoing folks.

331
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:38.675
I'll do just fine, George,
thank you.

332
00:24:38.735 --> 00:24:41.181
Oh, excuse me.

333
00:24:41.238 --> 00:24:44.549
Is Idgie Threadgoode here
by any chance?

334
00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:47.418
Come on in, honey.
She's right down here.

335
00:24:47.478 --> 00:24:50.925
- Here? Okay.
- Uh-huh.

336
00:24:50.981 --> 00:24:53.621
I'll see you,
Grady Kilgore,

337
00:24:53.684 --> 00:24:55.755
and I'll
raise you twenty.

338
00:24:55.819 --> 00:24:58.390
You ain't got nothin'!

339
00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:01.766
Maybe I do and
maybe I don't.

340
00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:06.069
Put your money where
your mouth is, Mr. Sheriff.

341
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.740
Well, look what
the cat drug in!

342
00:25:12.803 --> 00:25:16.683
I came to talk to you.

343
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.118
You're gonna have to wait.
I'm busy.

344
00:25:19.176 --> 00:25:21.782
Come on, Grady, this is your
big chance. You in or out?

345
00:25:21.845 --> 00:25:24.291
I'll make you
a rich man.

346
00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:27.352
You just bluffin' again
as usual

347
00:25:27.417 --> 00:25:30.421
I'm afraid you're gonna have to excuse
Idgie. She's goin' home for dinner.

348
00:25:30.487 --> 00:25:32.660
- Say good-bye, Idgie.
- Where you goin'?

349
00:25:32.723 --> 00:25:37.103
- Where the hell you goin' with my money?
- We're goin' home!

350
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.108
- Who are you to boss me around?
- The one holdin' your money!

351
00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:43.110
Give it back.

352
00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:45.305
Now, get in the car.

353
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.413
All right.
I'll get in the car.

354
00:25:50.474 --> 00:25:52.977
You win!

355
00:25:53.043 --> 00:25:56.024
Come on.

356
00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:57.649
Sucker!

357
00:25:57.714 --> 00:25:59.751
I'll leave when I want!

358
00:25:59.816 --> 00:26:03.628
I don't know how you can break
your mother's heart like you do.

359
00:26:03.687 --> 00:26:05.860
I'm not doin' anything
to my mother.

360
00:26:05.923 --> 00:26:08.494
Oh, no? Why do you think
I'm here for the summer?

361
00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:11.938
Your mother was so worried, she thought I
might be able to talk some sense into you.

362
00:26:11.995 --> 00:26:14.339
But you're too busy
being selfish!

363
00:26:14.398 --> 00:26:17.379
What are you
talkin' about?

364
00:26:17.434 --> 00:26:21.143
You're not the only one
who lost Buddy.

365
00:26:21.204 --> 00:26:23.309
We all miss him...

366
00:26:23.373 --> 00:26:26.252
but turning your back on
your family is not gonna help.

367
00:26:28.612 --> 00:26:30.683
What's he got to do
with anything?

368
00:26:30.747 --> 00:26:34.889
I oaks like you 're the one with
the problem forgetting my brother.

369
00:26:39.256 --> 00:26:41.759
Why just ten miles a way..

370
00:26:41.825 --> 00:26:43.736
Down by the river,

371
00:26:43.794 --> 00:26:46.035
there lurks
a den of the devil...

372
00:26:46.096 --> 00:26:49.942
Where liquor
and gamblin'...

373
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.844
and sin abide!

374
00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:56.578
Snakes and serpents-

375
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.813
Hey, Scroggins!

376
00:26:58.875 --> 00:27:02.846
You're finally preachin' about
somethin' you're kin to... snakes!

377
00:27:02.913 --> 00:27:06.224
As I said,

378
00:27:06.283 --> 00:27:11.426
snakes and serpents
take many disguises.

379
00:27:11.488 --> 00:27:14.765
Let's turn to page 53
in our hymnal.

380
00:27:20.864 --> 00:27:23.868
Yoo-hoo!

381
00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:28.747
Big George thought
I might find you here.

382
00:27:31.608 --> 00:27:36.455
If you give me a chance,
a chance to get to know you,

383
00:27:36.513 --> 00:27:40.256
maybe it'll be fun!

384
00:27:40.317 --> 00:27:43.730
Fun?

385
00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:47.064
Idgie,just spend
some time with me.

386
00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:49.070
Please?

387
00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:51.072
Suit yourself.

388
00:27:51.762 --> 00:27:54.436
You sure you don't
wanna back out?

389
00:27:54.498 --> 00:27:57.707
- It's not too late.
- I'm sure.

390
00:27:57.768 --> 00:28:00.112
Here, hold this.

391
00:28:02.105 --> 00:28:04.813
Tell me now,
you like trains?

392
00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:08.687
- Yes.
- Good.

393
00:28:08.745 --> 00:28:12.659
We'll get along
just fine!

394
00:28:14.151 --> 00:28:17.655
Boy, did we
luck out tonight.

395
00:28:20.524 --> 00:28:22.765
Hop in.

396
00:28:22.826 --> 00:28:25.363
Hop?

397
00:28:25.429 --> 00:28:28.467
Oh. Give me
your hand.

398
00:28:28.532 --> 00:28:31.012
Put your foot
up there.

399
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.449
Hold that.

400
00:28:43.346 --> 00:28:46.156
Ooo-ooo!
Look at all this!

401
00:28:50.754 --> 00:28:54.327
Don't you think we should get off
the train? It's startin' to move.

402
00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:58.203
No. The fun
just started!

403
00:29:01.531 --> 00:29:03.943
You all right?

404
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.244
Well, sometimes I get
a little dizzy lookin' down.

405
00:29:08.305 --> 00:29:11.013
Don't look down.

406
00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:27.664
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Look.

407
00:29:27.724 --> 00:29:30.637
They're throwin'
away food!

408
00:29:34.464 --> 00:29:37.104
You talk about
"give unto others."

409
00:29:37.167 --> 00:29:40.239
Yes, but this food
isn't yours to give.

410
00:29:40.303 --> 00:29:42.476
That's church talk.

411
00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:45.543
I've seen those same people
over at church on Sunday...

412
00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:48.249
over at the river club every
other night of the week,

413
00:29:48.311 --> 00:29:52.191
doin' anything
but pray. Come on.

414
00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:09.736
- More!
- Give me some.

415
00:30:35.058 --> 00:30:38.437
Okay, time to get off.

416
00:30:39.062 --> 00:30:41.042
We gotta jump.

417
00:30:41.097 --> 00:30:43.703
Lump?

418
00:30:43.767 --> 00:30:46.839
Yeah jump. The next stop's
five miles down the tracks.

419
00:30:46.903 --> 00:30:48.905
I don't wanna walk
that far back.

420
00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:51.851
Are you crazy?

421
00:30:51.908 --> 00:30:54.286
You're not kiddin'.

422
00:30:54.344 --> 00:30:58.019
Well...

423
00:30:58.081 --> 00:31:00.561
I give up. Jump. -

424
00:31:00.617 --> 00:31:03.894
I'll tell Mama I'm not
a good influence on you-

425
00:31:03.954 --> 00:31:06.230
You'll never jump,
will you?

426
00:31:08.258 --> 00:31:11.398
Don't say "never"
to me.

427
00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.216
Towanda!

428
00:31:39.089 --> 00:31:41.695
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

429
00:31:41.758 --> 00:31:45.331
I'm all right.

430
00:31:45.395 --> 00:31:47.534
Ow!

431
00:31:47.597 --> 00:31:49.941
Does this hurt?

432
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.776
Guess so.

433
00:31:52.836 --> 00:31:55.146
- We better get you to
a doc-doctor. - Shit!

434
00:31:55.205 --> 00:31:57.310
Which way is it?

435
00:31:57.374 --> 00:32:00.981
About two miles
down the tracks.

436
00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.285
All right.
let's go.

437
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:08.585
You'll never be able
to carry me that far.

438
00:32:08.652 --> 00:32:11.360
I know.
Never say never.

439
00:32:11.421 --> 00:32:15.563
I'm not carryin' you.
You're walkin'.

440
00:32:21.498 --> 00:32:26.243
Thank you, Julian.
I owe you one.

441
00:32:38.148 --> 00:32:40.094
Uh. Ow.

442
00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:43.723
Aren't you ready yet?

443
00:32:43.787 --> 00:32:45.892
What?

444
00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:51.030
This doesn't have anything
to do with trains, does it?

445
00:32:51.928 --> 00:32:54.169
You like honey?

446
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.210
Yeah, I like honey.

447
00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:58.268
- Fresh honey?
- Yeah.

448
00:32:58.335 --> 00:33:01.873
Me too.
There it is.

449
00:33:01.938 --> 00:33:06.148
There what... is?

450
00:33:06.209 --> 00:33:10.089
You'll see soon enough.

451
00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.291
Now... stay here.

452
00:33:16.353 --> 00:33:19.300
No matter what happens,
don't move.

453
00:33:19.356 --> 00:33:22.633
What are you
gonna do?

454
00:33:57.627 --> 00:33:59.732
Ah.

455
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.937
Here you are, madam.
This is for you.

456
00:34:38.001 --> 00:34:42.381
Why did you do that?
You could have been killed.

457
00:34:42.439 --> 00:34:45.943
I'm sorry.

458
00:34:46.009 --> 00:34:48.717
Don't you want
the honey?

459
00:34:48.778 --> 00:34:52.123
I got it
just for you.

460
00:34:52.182 --> 00:34:54.662
It's all right.
I do it all the time.

461
00:34:54.717 --> 00:34:58.494
I never get stung,
honest.

462
00:34:58.555 --> 00:35:00.557
Don't be
mad at me, Ruth.

463
00:35:00.623 --> 00:35:04.537
Idgie.
I'm not mad at you.

464
00:35:04.594 --> 00:35:07.165
No foolin'?

465
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.678
Is it bad,
what I did?

466
00:35:16.739 --> 00:35:19.083
No.

467
00:35:19.142 --> 00:35:21.315
I thought I might
be crazy or somethin'.

468
00:35:21.377 --> 00:35:24.187
No, no.

469
00:35:24.247 --> 00:35:27.922
I've heard there were people
who could charm bees.

470
00:35:27.984 --> 00:35:31.625
I've just never seen
it done... before today.

471
00:35:33.523 --> 00:35:37.903
You're just a bee charmer,
Idgie Threadgoode.

472
00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:42.432
That's what you are,
a bee charmer.

473
00:35:42.499 --> 00:35:45.241
Here, you want
to taste it?

474
00:35:51.374 --> 00:35:54.116
"Satan started to laugh
at job's devotion.

475
00:35:54.177 --> 00:35:59.422
"He bet God that job would
never have so much faith...

476
00:35:59.482 --> 00:36:01.587
"if he didn't have
so many blessings.

477
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:05.531
"He went on and on so long and
so much that God finally agreed...

478
00:36:05.588 --> 00:36:08.296
"to let Satan
put Job to a test.

479
00:36:08.358 --> 00:36:11.498
"Suddenly from bein'
on top of the world,

480
00:36:11.561 --> 00:36:15.202
Job was plunged down into
the deepest pits of misery."

481
00:36:17.233 --> 00:36:19.975
Surprise!

482
00:36:22.238 --> 00:36:24.184
Idgie Threadgoode!

483
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.186
Tonight we're gonna have
a real party.

484
00:36:26.242 --> 00:36:28.483
Drink this... and then,
we're gonna play some poker.

485
00:36:28.545 --> 00:36:32.425
I don't know how to play
poker and I never drink...

486
00:36:32.482 --> 00:36:34.484
but thank you anyway.

487
00:36:39.622 --> 00:36:42.125
Here comes the windup.

488
00:36:42.192 --> 00:36:44.536
Burn that ball in here.
Burn 'em in here!

489
00:36:44.594 --> 00:36:48.974
- Right in the pocket.
- I don't know how to bat.

490
00:36:49.032 --> 00:36:51.842
And you don't drink,
either.

491
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:55.007
- It's gonna be a spitter.
- Hold the bat and swing

492
00:36:55.071 --> 00:36:56.812
Spitter?

493
00:36:56.873 --> 00:37:00.082
- She gonna spit at me?
- She's gonna spit on the ball

494
00:37:00.143 --> 00:37:03.352
Swing that bat!
Take another crack at it.

495
00:37:03.413 --> 00:37:05.586
I'm gonna take
another crack at it.

496
00:37:05.648 --> 00:37:08.857
Get 'em in here.

497
00:37:16.359 --> 00:37:19.169
Now run, Ruth.
Run!

498
00:37:19.229 --> 00:37:21.231
Come on
around the bases!

499
00:37:21.297 --> 00:37:23.299
Don't kiss everybody.
Run!

500
00:37:23.366 --> 00:37:26.404
I have never had
so much fun...

501
00:37:26.469 --> 00:37:28.813
in my whole life.

502
00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:32.182
I even got a home run.

503
00:37:32.242 --> 00:37:35.223
A clean one
at that!

504
00:37:35.278 --> 00:37:38.487
A straight beats
three of a kind.

505
00:37:43.586 --> 00:37:47.830
You know,
poker isn't half bad.

506
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:50.063
What's your mother
gonna say...

507
00:37:50.126 --> 00:37:53.505
when she sees us both...
drunk?

508
00:37:53.563 --> 00:37:57.477
- You gotta stop worrying about what people think.
- I know.

509
00:37:57.533 --> 00:37:59.535
You've always done
the right thing.

510
00:37:59.602 --> 00:38:03.049
You took care of your daddy,
the preacher, when he took sick.

511
00:38:03.106 --> 00:38:06.986
You take care of all the kids
over at the church school.

512
00:38:07.043 --> 00:38:09.785
You're gonna
take care of your mama.

513
00:38:09.846 --> 00:38:13.384
And I'm gonna marry
the man I'm supposed to.

514
00:38:13.449 --> 00:38:15.725
You gettin' married?

515
00:38:15.785 --> 00:38:20.063
As soon as
the summer's over.

516
00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:27.302
Oh, am I
gonna miss you.

517
00:38:27.363 --> 00:38:30.503
This is
the best birthday...

518
00:38:30.566 --> 00:38:33.547
I ever had.

519
00:38:46.082 --> 00:38:49.689
Ruth invited Idgie
to the weddin',

520
00:38:49.752 --> 00:38:52.358
but Idgie never did
write back.

521
00:38:52.422 --> 00:38:56.837
No, but she did drive all night
to Valdosta, Georgia,

522
00:38:56.893 --> 00:38:58.839
to watch from afar.

523
00:38:58.895 --> 00:39:01.876
Oh, here we go!

524
00:39:01.931 --> 00:39:05.435
And she swore
she'd never see Ruth again.

525
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:08.744
No sir!
Whew!

526
00:39:08.805 --> 00:39:13.083
Now, Mama Jamison,
you put that down.

527
00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:15.748
Oh, my Lord!

528
00:39:22.251 --> 00:39:24.390
During these next few weeks,

529
00:39:24.454 --> 00:39:28.800
we will be learning to reclaim
our own power as women!

530
00:39:28.858 --> 00:39:30.963
Hallelujah!

531
00:39:31.027 --> 00:39:35.806
And tonight, we're gonna
begin to explore...

532
00:39:35.865 --> 00:39:38.072
our own femaleness...

533
00:39:38.134 --> 00:39:42.708
by examining the source
of our strength...

534
00:39:42.772 --> 00:39:45.150
and our separateness.

535
00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:47.188
Our vaginas.

536
00:39:49.145 --> 00:39:51.955
So if ya'll will just
slip off your panties...

537
00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:55.552
and straddle your mirrors.

538
00:39:55.618 --> 00:40:01.801
Ms. Couch!

539
00:40:01.858 --> 00:40:06.238
Um, I need to be excused
for a minute.

540
00:40:06.295 --> 00:40:10.368
Um, Missy, could you come
with me to the ladies' room?

541
00:40:10.433 --> 00:40:14.176
- Do you find this threatening?
- Uh, well, um-

542
00:40:14.237 --> 00:40:18.379
- do you have a problem with your sexuality?
- No, ma'am.

543
00:40:18.441 --> 00:40:21.479
But I do have a problem
with my girdle.

544
00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:49.808
All right, fried chicken!
My favorite.

545
00:40:55.678 --> 00:41:00.952
Ed?

546
00:41:01.017 --> 00:41:05.523
Those classes I've been taking
aren't helpin' us one bit.

547
00:41:05.588 --> 00:41:08.262
Let's go to Florida...

548
00:41:08.324 --> 00:41:10.668
like when
we got married.

549
00:41:10.726 --> 00:41:14.071
Kyle's gone,
busy with his own life.

550
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.132
It'd be
just the two of us.

551
00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:19.146
Well, honey, it's just
the two of us here now.

552
00:41:19.202 --> 00:41:21.910
Boy, you got a good scald
on that chicken!

553
00:41:21.971 --> 00:41:24.975
- I'm tellin' you, that's really good.
- Thank you.

554
00:41:25.041 --> 00:41:26.987
We could rent a boat...

555
00:41:27.043 --> 00:41:30.718
and drift around
in the hot sun.

556
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.885
What do you
think about it?

557
00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:35.953
I'm just gettin' used to it
being quiet around here.

558
00:41:36.018 --> 00:41:39.795
Honey, if those classes
aren't doin' you any good,

559
00:41:39.856 --> 00:41:42.837
then don't go to 'em.

560
00:41:42.892 --> 00:41:45.498
Everyone needs a miracle
in their life.

561
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:49.703
Damn, game's
blacked out!

562
00:41:57.607 --> 00:42:00.213
Yoo-hoo,
Mrs. Threadgoode?

563
00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:03.689
Hey. Evelyn!

564
00:42:03.746 --> 00:42:05.953
Do you like it?

565
00:42:06.015 --> 00:42:09.394
Oooh! Well,

566
00:42:09.452 --> 00:42:12.399
- who did it for ya, darlin'?
- Believe it or not,

567
00:42:12.455 --> 00:42:14.401
It was a student,
a little bitty thing,

568
00:42:14.457 --> 00:42:18.064
no bigger than a midget
from the beauty college.

569
00:42:18.127 --> 00:42:21.472
Sometimes they come out here
and do our hair for free...

570
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:24.341
just for the practice,
you know.

571
00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.940
- Is Ed with ya?
- No, ma'am.

572
00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:32.748
His aunt said she didn't want
visitors anymore, especially us.

573
00:42:32.808 --> 00:42:37.052
It's a shame.
I know he feels bad,

574
00:42:37.113 --> 00:42:40.117
but Lord if he'll
talk to me about it.

575
00:42:45.054 --> 00:42:47.295
Oh, thank you.

576
00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:50.337
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

577
00:42:51.794 --> 00:42:54.707
Mrs. Threadgoode-

578
00:42:57.967 --> 00:43:01.915
How about tellin' me
some more... about Idgie?

579
00:43:01.971 --> 00:43:04.349
Oh, well, now,
let me see.

580
00:43:04.407 --> 00:43:09.720
Where were we? Ruth had just
gotten married to Frank Bennett?

581
00:43:09.779 --> 00:43:12.123
Wasn't that the man Idgie
was arrested for murderin'?

582
00:43:12.181 --> 00:43:15.390
That's right.

583
00:43:15.451 --> 00:43:21.026
After Ruth left, Idgie
went back to her old ways,

584
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:25.630
Hangin' out with Grady and
the boys at the river club.

585
00:43:25.695 --> 00:43:31.577
But after a few years,
temptation got the better of her.

586
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:38.316
I don't wanna wake you, Miss Idgie,
but it's an all-day drive to Valdosta.

587
00:43:38.374 --> 00:43:41.412
Your mama said if you're goin', she
wants you to take this pie to Miss Ruth.

588
00:43:41.477 --> 00:43:46.426
- How does she know where I'm going?
- I told her.

589
00:43:46.482 --> 00:43:49.929
Don't you go stirrin' up
no trouble for Miss Ruth now.

590
00:43:49.986 --> 00:43:52.296
- Yes, ma'am.
- Don't "yes, ma'am" me.

591
00:43:52.355 --> 00:43:54.335
You can stay in my house
as long as you want,

592
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.098
but don't treat me
like you treat your mama.

593
00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:59.571
- Grandma!
- Yes, ma'am.

594
00:44:26.756 --> 00:44:28.702
Hi there.

595
00:44:28.758 --> 00:44:32.672
- Yes?
- Uh, is Ruth at home?

596
00:44:32.728 --> 00:44:34.867
Who's callin'?

597
00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:39.242
You just tell her it's the
bee charmer from Alabama.

598
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:42.282
Ruth,

599
00:44:42.338 --> 00:44:46.150
there's some bee person
here to see you.

600
00:44:59.088 --> 00:45:02.729
- Idgie.
- Hi.

601
00:45:02.792 --> 00:45:06.399
You got a real nice home,
real nice things and all.

602
00:45:06.462 --> 00:45:08.464
Mm-hmm,
thank you.

603
00:45:08.531 --> 00:45:13.002
Mama said to give you
this pie.

604
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:15.845
So-

605
00:45:17.907 --> 00:45:22.913
Idgie Threadgoode,
how are ya?

606
00:45:22.978 --> 00:45:27.586
You look so...
so grown up.

607
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:32.224
All the guys
must be wild about you.

608
00:45:32.288 --> 00:45:36.065
Tell me,
do you have a fella yet?

609
00:45:36.125 --> 00:45:40.574
A... couple.

610
00:45:40.629 --> 00:45:43.007
I haven't decided
on any.

611
00:45:43.065 --> 00:45:45.011
Grady's the most
persistent, but-

612
00:45:45.067 --> 00:45:47.980
- Grady Kilgore?
- Don't say it so loud.

613
00:45:48.037 --> 00:45:50.711
Ruth, honey
who's down there?

614
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:53.821
- Hey-
- Well-

615
00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:56.356
- What happened to you?
- Nothin'.

616
00:45:56.412 --> 00:45:58.551
Nothin'!
Where'd you get the shiner?

617
00:45:58.614 --> 00:46:00.560
Well, I-
Who's down there?

618
00:46:00.616 --> 00:46:03.790
- You'd better leave now.
- Did he hit you?

619
00:46:03.853 --> 00:46:07.562
- Did he beat you? Somebody's got to talk to him.
- Idgie.

620
00:46:07.623 --> 00:46:09.762
- You're not gonna do anything.
- I'm gonna kill him.

621
00:46:09.825 --> 00:46:11.896
I'm gonna have a
conversation with him about...

622
00:46:11.961 --> 00:46:14.737
- You're not gonna do anything.
- ... pickin' on somebody his own size.

623
00:46:14.797 --> 00:46:17.277
You're not gonna do
anything, understand?

624
00:46:17.333 --> 00:46:19.540
If you care about me,
if you really do,

625
00:46:19.602 --> 00:46:23.516
you'll turn around and leave
this minute. You understand?

626
00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:40.194
Well, what'd
she want?

627
00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:45.534
Nothin'.

628
00:46:55.371 --> 00:46:59.945
Ruth's a grown woman, and
she knows what's best for her.

629
00:47:00.009 --> 00:47:03.513
Mmm, I'm not so sure
about that.

630
00:47:04.013 --> 00:47:06.050
Idgie?

631
00:47:06.115 --> 00:47:08.425
Grady.
Hi.

632
00:47:08.484 --> 00:47:12.125
- Idgie,will you dance with me?
- No.

633
00:47:12.188 --> 00:47:14.828
Come on.
It's only a dance.

634
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:21.733
- Miss Idgie Threadgoode...
- Get your butt off the floor.

635
00:47:21.797 --> 00:47:25.040
Will you dance
with me?

636
00:47:27.269 --> 00:47:32.014
I will not dance with you,
and I will not marry you.

637
00:47:32.074 --> 00:47:35.248
Go marry Gladys Moats.
She just adores you.

638
00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:39.282
But she did fall on her
head when she was a child.

639
00:47:40.482 --> 00:47:43.793
You're just a goofy girl,
Idgie, a goofy girl.

640
00:47:43.853 --> 00:47:45.855
- Who're you callin'
a goof? - Ow-ow-ow!

641
00:47:45.921 --> 00:47:49.095
- Who you callin' a goof?
- Stop that before I get mad and hurt ya.

642
00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:51.331
Oh, yeah.
You try it.

643
00:47:51.393 --> 00:47:54.931
- Grady!
- There now, you give up?

644
00:47:54.997 --> 00:47:56.977
No, I'll never
give up!

645
00:47:57.032 --> 00:48:01.572
Grady finally got dizzy
and give up.

646
00:48:01.637 --> 00:48:06.279
Try as they might, none of them
fellas could tame Idgie.

647
00:48:06.976 --> 00:48:09.183
Now,
a little while later,

648
00:48:09.245 --> 00:48:13.022
a letter
come from Ruth.

649
00:48:17.586 --> 00:48:20.294
Oh.
It's an obituary.

650
00:48:20.356 --> 00:48:23.803
Oh, no, honey,
Ruth's mother died.

651
00:48:23.859 --> 00:48:25.805
Oh.

652
00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:27.966
And this
is from the Bible.

653
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.601
It's from
the book of Ruth.

654
00:48:30.666 --> 00:48:35.911
"And Ruth said,
whither thou goest, I will go;

655
00:48:35.971 --> 00:48:38.315
"where thou lodgest,
I will lodge;

656
00:48:38.374 --> 00:48:42.083
thy people
shall be my people."

657
00:48:59.929 --> 00:49:04.036
All right Julian,
you and Big George wait here.

658
00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:19.252
- Mama died.
- I know.

659
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:25.764
And I'm pregnant.

660
00:49:43.072 --> 00:49:46.679
Julian, I got another box here
when you're done!

661
00:49:57.419 --> 00:49:59.456
I never seen anybody
with so many hats.

662
00:49:59.521 --> 00:50:01.694
Why don't we put
three in one box?

663
00:50:01.757 --> 00:50:04.704
I don't think we can fit
all these in the car.

664
00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.866
We're gonna need a separate
truck for all your stuff.

665
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:09.876
What the hell
is going on here?

666
00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:11.878
Looks like your wife's
leavin' you, mister.

667
00:50:11.934 --> 00:50:16.781
- Sure she is. Don't
you touch her! Let go.

668
00:50:16.839 --> 00:50:20.446
You bastard!

669
00:50:20.509 --> 00:50:22.455
Put her down!

670
00:50:22.511 --> 00:50:24.752
- Bastard!
- Whoooo!

671
00:50:24.813 --> 00:50:26.952
Stop it!

672
00:50:29.752 --> 00:50:31.425
Don't you hurt her!

673
00:50:31.487 --> 00:50:34.400
Frank!

674
00:50:37.693 --> 00:50:41.072
I wouldn't do that
if I was you, mister.

675
00:50:43.632 --> 00:50:47.444
See, the thing is,
you might upset Big George.

676
00:50:47.503 --> 00:50:49.915
And he's crazy

677
00:50:49.972 --> 00:50:54.079
There's no tellin'
what he might do.

678
00:51:14.863 --> 00:51:18.242
Go on,
get outta here.

679
00:51:28.343 --> 00:51:30.983
Hey!

680
00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:34.357
Come on! Hey hey!
Come on now!

681
00:51:34.416 --> 00:51:37.420
Let's go. Come on.
You okay?

682
00:51:37.486 --> 00:51:40.092
Let's get Miss Ruth
and get outta here.

683
00:51:40.155 --> 00:51:43.864
Come on, Miss Ruth.
Come on.

684
00:51:45.394 --> 00:51:49.365
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you.

685
00:51:55.037 --> 00:51:58.280
Well, I sure as hell
scared him, didn't I?

686
00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.980
Yeah you sure scared him.

687
00:52:01.043 --> 00:52:04.024
Towanda,
the amazing Amazon woman!

688
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:06.081
Towanda?

689
00:52:06.148 --> 00:52:08.958
Towanda! Towanda!

690
00:52:11.854 --> 00:52:14.801
Evelyn?
Evelyn!

691
00:52:14.857 --> 00:52:17.030
Oh!
I'm sorry.

692
00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:19.163
I was just lookin'
at the pictures, Missy.

693
00:52:19.228 --> 00:52:22.573
They have the greatest stories
in that magazine, don't they?

694
00:52:22.631 --> 00:52:25.009
Will I see you
in group tonight?

695
00:52:25.067 --> 00:52:27.604
We'll be talking about
masturbation.

696
00:52:27.669 --> 00:52:31.776
No, I don't think so. I think I've
had enough learnin' for the time bein'.

697
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.617
Thank you.
Thank you.

698
00:52:35.677 --> 00:52:38.419
Oh!
Excuse me.

699
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.484
Screw you!

700
00:52:48.223 --> 00:52:50.260
Excuse me,
young man.

701
00:52:50.325 --> 00:52:54.137
There was no reason for you
to be so rude to me.

702
00:52:54.196 --> 00:52:56.767
- Get away from me, you fat cow.
- What did you call me?

703
00:52:56.832 --> 00:52:59.335
Beat it,
you old bitch.

704
00:52:59.401 --> 00:53:02.382
Why are you being
so mean to me?

705
00:53:02.437 --> 00:53:05.611
What did I ever
do to you-

706
00:53:05.674 --> 00:53:09.144
I don't understand!

707
00:53:17.486 --> 00:53:20.558
Look at my Stove Top!

708
00:53:27.029 --> 00:53:29.873
BOO!

709
00:53:29.932 --> 00:53:34.540
Oh, honey, what in the world
is the matter?

710
00:53:34.603 --> 00:53:37.345
I don't know.

711
00:53:39.107 --> 00:53:42.486
Come on.

712
00:53:42.544 --> 00:53:45.548
Come on.
I need some exercise.

713
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:59.471
Now, you tell me what's
botherin' you, sugar.

714
00:53:59.528 --> 00:54:04.102
I just-
I just feel so useless.

715
00:54:04.166 --> 00:54:08.012
So-
So powerless.

716
00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:13.019
- Everybody goes through that.
- But I can't stop eatin'.

717
00:54:13.075 --> 00:54:18.024
Every day I try and try
and every day I go off.

718
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:24.087
I hide candy bars
all over the house.

719
00:54:24.152 --> 00:54:27.133
A candy bar ain't
gonna hurt ya none.

720
00:54:27.189 --> 00:54:31.535
One, no.
But 10 or 11?

721
00:54:32.928 --> 00:54:36.307
I can't even look
at my own vagina.

722
00:54:36.365 --> 00:54:39.835
I can't help ya
on that one.

723
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:44.316
I wish I had the courage to get
it over with and get really fat.

724
00:54:48.243 --> 00:54:52.692
Oh, Mrs. Threadgoode,
I just-

725
00:54:52.748 --> 00:54:57.254
I'm too young to be old
and I'm too old to be young.

726
00:54:59.154 --> 00:55:01.998
Maybe I'm just
goin' crazy.

727
00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:06.801
You get hot flashes?

728
00:55:06.862 --> 00:55:08.808
Sometimes.

729
00:55:08.864 --> 00:55:12.903
You get the sweats and your
hearts starts a-poundin'?

730
00:55:12.968 --> 00:55:15.312
- How did you know?
- Simple, honey.

731
00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:19.079
- You're going through
the change.

732
00:55:19.141 --> 00:55:23.647
I used to burst into tears
for no reason at all.

733
00:55:25.314 --> 00:55:27.624
You need some hormones. Hmm?

734
00:55:27.683 --> 00:55:31.290
Maybe some Stresstabs
number 4 for good measure.

735
00:55:31.353 --> 00:55:34.823
- Really? Is that all?
- Sure, honey.

736
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:37.234
You get yourself
some hormones.

737
00:55:37.292 --> 00:55:40.796
Then you get outta
the house and get a job.

738
00:55:42.164 --> 00:55:44.610
With your
pretty complexion...

739
00:55:44.666 --> 00:55:48.443
I'll bet you'll be
great with cosmetics.

740
00:55:49.838 --> 00:55:53.411
I know how
you feel.

741
00:55:53.475 --> 00:55:56.922
I was about your age
when I had my child.

742
00:55:56.978 --> 00:55:59.481
Then I went through
the change of life.

743
00:55:59.548 --> 00:56:04.190
- I didn't know you had a child.
- Yes, I did.

744
00:56:04.252 --> 00:56:07.233
Albert.

745
00:56:07.289 --> 00:56:11.897
When he was born, the doctor said
it would be best if I didn't see him.

746
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.067
He said his mind would never
develop past the age of five,

747
00:56:16.131 --> 00:56:19.112
and I should just put him
in an institution...

748
00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:23.843
because the burden of raisin' a
child like that would be too great.

749
00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.887
Well, I thought
about Ruth.

750
00:56:31.446 --> 00:56:33.790
She always said...

751
00:56:33.849 --> 00:56:37.296
there was a separate
God for children.

752
00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:42.267
Sol smiled at him and
I asked for the baby.

753
00:56:42.324 --> 00:56:47.034
Oh, how could anybody think
that sweet, precious baby...

754
00:56:47.095 --> 00:56:49.336
could ever
be a burden?

755
00:56:49.398 --> 00:56:53.710
Why, from the minute he was born,
Albert was the joy of my life,

756
00:56:53.769 --> 00:56:56.807
the Lord's
greatest gift.

757
00:56:56.872 --> 00:57:01.446
I don't believe there was a purer
soul ever lived on this earth.

758
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:04.491
I had him with me
till he was 30.

759
00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:08.824
Then he went to sleep
and didn't wake up.

760
00:57:10.218 --> 00:57:12.960
Sometimes I can't wait to get
to heaven to see him again.

761
00:57:16.591 --> 00:57:18.537
Whoa!

762
00:57:18.593 --> 00:57:21.870
Shit!
It's a boy!

763
00:57:24.065 --> 00:57:27.774
I think a prayer of
thanksgivin' would be in order.

764
00:57:27.836 --> 00:57:31.841
Goddamn it to hell, son-of-a-bitch,
she did it! Here's to Ruth!

765
00:57:31.907 --> 00:57:36.185
Idgie always did have a way
with words around the reverend.

766
00:57:36.878 --> 00:57:40.382
Well, Ruth had a baby

767
00:57:40.449 --> 00:57:43.191
She named him Buddy-
Buddy junior.

768
00:57:43.251 --> 00:57:48.394
Papa went out and borrowed money so
Ruth and Idgie could start a cafe,

769
00:57:48.457 --> 00:57:50.698
the Whistle Stop 6.22%.

770
00:58:26.928 --> 00:58:29.204
Miss Idgie
can you get the door?

771
00:58:29.264 --> 00:58:32.871
Yes.
Big George.

772
00:58:32.934 --> 00:58:36.245
Miss Ruth, me and the missus
want to thank you...

773
00:58:36.304 --> 00:58:38.477
for sendin' that soup
over last night.

774
00:58:38.540 --> 00:58:42.784
- I'll pay you when I get ahead.
- You don't owe me, Ocie.

775
00:58:42.844 --> 00:58:45.518
- Thank you.
- I'm just glad they're better.

776
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:49.255
- How is this, by the way?
- It's good, very good.

777
00:58:49.317 --> 00:58:52.787
I'm not happy
till I see clean plates.

778
00:58:55.457 --> 00:58:57.994
Can't go on,
Idgie.

779
00:58:58.059 --> 00:59:00.369
I'm talking to you
as a friend.

780
00:59:00.428 --> 00:59:04.899
- There's people in this town,
paying customers too- - There you go.

781
00:59:04.966 --> 00:59:08.607
But some people
don't like you...

782
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.843
sellin' to coloreds.

783
00:59:10.906 --> 00:59:12.886
Here you go.

784
00:59:12.941 --> 00:59:16.855
Tell you what. Next time
those "some people" come here,

785
00:59:16.912 --> 00:59:19.358
I'm gonna ask if they
don't want anybody to know...

786
00:59:19.414 --> 00:59:21.587
who they are
under those sheets...

787
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:25.757
when they go marchin'
in those stupid parades,

788
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.664
how come they don't have
sense to change their shoes?

789
00:59:28.755 --> 00:59:32.100
- Hold on there.
- Y'all ain't foolin' anybody.

790
00:59:32.159 --> 00:59:36.369
I'd recognize those size 14
clodhoppers you got anywhere.

791
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:39.570
- Just a minute, Idgie.
- More pie, Grady?

792
00:59:39.633 --> 00:59:42.136
No, thank you, Ruth.

793
00:59:42.202 --> 00:59:45.775
Idgie, I'll talk
to the boys.

794
00:59:45.839 --> 00:59:48.012
You just keep them
on out back there, ya hear?

795
00:59:48.075 --> 00:59:52.854
- Bye, Ruth.
- Bye, Grady.

796
00:59:53.547 --> 00:59:54.992
You're gonna get yourself
in a heap of trouble.

797
00:59:55.048 --> 00:59:59.053
What, Grady?
He's harmless.

798
00:59:59.119 --> 01:00:03.158
You shoulda seen that
big ox down by the river.

799
01:00:03.223 --> 01:00:07.262
Three solid days, drunk as
a dog, cryin' like a baby...

800
01:00:07.327 --> 01:00:10.103
'cause Joe, that ol' colored
man that raised him, died.

801
01:00:10.163 --> 01:00:12.109
- Remember that, Sipsey?
- Yes'm.

802
01:00:12.165 --> 01:00:14.873
- He sure ain't' jokin' now, is he, son?
- No, ma'am.

803
01:00:14.935 --> 01:00:17.313
He won't even sit in the same
room and have a meal today.

804
01:00:17.371 --> 01:00:22.320
Don't make no sense. Big ox like Grady
won't sit next to a colored child,

805
01:00:22.376 --> 01:00:25.823
but he eats eggs
- Shoot right out of a chicken's ass.

806
01:00:50.737 --> 01:00:53.411
Come on, Smokey,
let's go for a walk.

807
01:01:02.382 --> 01:01:05.158
I'm sorry about
spillin' my food, ma'am.

808
01:01:05.218 --> 01:01:08.893
I'll just
head on.

809
01:01:17.597 --> 01:01:20.635
See that piece
of land over there?

810
01:01:20.701 --> 01:01:23.511
See it?
That used to be a lake.

811
01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.572
Yeah.

812
01:01:25.639 --> 01:01:27.585
This one November,

813
01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:29.587
all these ducks
come by...

814
01:01:29.643 --> 01:01:32.920
and they landed
on that lake.

815
01:01:32.979 --> 01:01:37.086
Then the temperature dropped so
fast, the whole lake just froze.

816
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:40.188
Then the ducks took off
and took the lake with 'em.

817
01:01:40.253 --> 01:01:43.063
Now that lake's somewhere
in Georgia, the way I hear it.

818
01:01:43.123 --> 01:01:45.797
Go on now.

819
01:01:59.406 --> 01:02:01.886
God bless you,
ma'am.

820
01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:33.147
Here, try this.

821
01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:40.949
- So what do you think?
- They're okay.

822
01:02:41.014 --> 01:02:44.723
- The truth.
- Well-

823
01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.096
They're terrible.

824
01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:55.106
Oh, well, don't be shy.
Tell me how you feel.

825
01:02:55.162 --> 01:02:57.699
I will.

826
01:03:10.377 --> 01:03:12.550
What'd you go
and do that for?

827
01:03:15.348 --> 01:03:18.625
I just thought you needed
a little coolin' off.

828
01:03:18.685 --> 01:03:22.792
You're right.

829
01:03:36.136 --> 01:03:39.549
Try these.

830
01:03:43.376 --> 01:03:46.050
I think we need
to make a little paste.

831
01:04:05.131 --> 01:04:07.873
What in the name of
Christmas are you two doing?

832
01:04:07.934 --> 01:04:09.880
She's tryin' to teach me how to cook.

833
01:04:09.936 --> 01:04:12.815
Look at those
fried green tomatoes.

834
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:21.256
You better stop this. I'm gonna have
to arrest you for disorderly conduct.

835
01:04:21.314 --> 01:04:23.794
Arrest us then.
Let me handle this.

836
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:26.126
- All right.
- Grady.

837
01:04:27.921 --> 01:04:30.424
Ha-ha-ha!

838
01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:34.666
Arrest us.
Go ahead, arrest us.

839
01:04:34.728 --> 01:04:39.108
Ruth, I have to say it. I believe
Idgie's been a bad influence on ya.

840
01:04:39.165 --> 01:04:42.305
I agree.

841
01:05:21.308 --> 01:05:24.414
I'll be back in a minute.

842
01:05:24.477 --> 01:05:26.548
Y'all keep the show
going till then.

843
01:05:26.613 --> 01:05:28.650
We ain't goin'
nowhere.

844
01:05:29.783 --> 01:05:32.923
- ... down again.
- She's still poorly.

845
01:05:32.986 --> 01:05:35.990
Where's the baby?
Who are you?

846
01:05:38.358 --> 01:05:40.736
What do you want?

847
01:05:40.794 --> 01:05:43.638
Frank!

848
01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:47.938
Get outta here.

849
01:05:48.001 --> 01:05:51.744
- Get on outta here!
- Go on, get outta here and leave us alone.

850
01:05:51.805 --> 01:05:54.115
Come on now, Ruth.

851
01:05:54.174 --> 01:05:58.884
You wouldn't deny a father the
right to see his son, would ya?

852
01:05:58.945 --> 01:06:01.755
You git, I say.
Scat you!

853
01:06:01.815 --> 01:06:05.695
Damn! Gimme that. Let it go!

854
01:06:12.459 --> 01:06:17.568
Well, that's my boy,
isn't it?

855
01:06:22.369 --> 01:06:24.975
Everything all right, ma'am?

856
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:30.745
Our guest
is just leavin'.

857
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.756
Come on, Frank,
let's go.

858
01:06:36.216 --> 01:06:39.163
I'll be back.

859
01:06:39.219 --> 01:06:42.996
In the end, you and
the baby gonna be back.

860
01:06:46.159 --> 01:06:50.198
I ain't scared
of you! No, sir!

861
01:06:50.263 --> 01:06:53.676
You should be.

862
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:05.788
Mind your manners, boy!

863
01:07:14.687 --> 01:07:17.065
Grady,

864
01:07:17.123 --> 01:07:20.366
what does Gladys think
of you stayin' out late...

865
01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:24.739
and losin' your money to me
in poker night after night?

866
01:07:25.565 --> 01:07:28.409
She likes it
just fine.

867
01:07:32.972 --> 01:07:35.612
- They got Big George.
- Idgie!

868
01:07:35.675 --> 01:07:38.178
- Let go of him!
- Let me handle this!

869
01:07:38.244 --> 01:07:42.124
We seen how you treat your niggers
around here and we don't like it.

870
01:07:42.182 --> 01:07:46.460
I'm the law in these parts. I don't
care what you like or don't like.

871
01:07:46.519 --> 01:07:48.499
Turn him loose.

872
01:07:48.555 --> 01:07:51.764
Don't get riled up,
nigger lover.

873
01:07:51.825 --> 01:07:56.296
You deaf or somethin'?
I said, let him go!

874
01:07:56.362 --> 01:07:59.343
- Before you get yourselves in a whole lot of trouble!
- Calm down.

875
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:02.175
We wanted to have
a little get-together...

876
01:08:02.235 --> 01:08:05.216
and make sure we see
eye to eye on some things.

877
01:08:05.271 --> 01:08:08.718
You hear me now?

878
01:08:08.775 --> 01:08:10.812
Let's let him go, boys.

879
01:08:10.877 --> 01:08:12.584
We've had enough fun
for one night.

880
01:08:12.645 --> 01:08:14.591
- Turn him loose.
- Come on.

881
01:08:14.647 --> 01:08:16.627
No, you're gonna
get in trouble.

882
01:08:19.185 --> 01:08:21.722
Well, now,
that's more like it.

883
01:08:21.788 --> 01:08:24.735
Seems I don't recognize
any of you boys.

884
01:08:24.791 --> 01:08:27.032
Y'all ain't from Whistle Stop,
are you?

885
01:08:30.063 --> 01:08:32.134
This ought to do it.

886
01:08:32.198 --> 01:08:35.202
I want to thank you,
Miss Idgie.

887
01:08:35.268 --> 01:08:40.445
Forget it. You'd have
done the same for me.

888
01:08:40.507 --> 01:08:44.319
Try to get some sleep.

889
01:08:49.115 --> 01:08:52.221
Who the hell
were those assholes?

890
01:08:52.285 --> 01:08:57.564
They's just some old boys from Georgia
come over here to put a scare in you.

891
01:08:57.624 --> 01:09:00.070
Well, it worked.

892
01:09:00.126 --> 01:09:02.834
One of 'em was here
the other day for something,

893
01:09:02.896 --> 01:09:05.433
seen you sellin' food
to coloreds.

894
01:09:05.498 --> 01:09:09.571
They decided to come back,
shake you up a bit.

895
01:09:09.636 --> 01:09:13.083
I told 'em we don't need anybody
from Georgia comin' over here...

896
01:09:13.139 --> 01:09:15.676
tellin' us what
we can or cannot do.

897
01:09:15.742 --> 01:09:20.919
They won't be back. I
guaran-gol-damn-tee you that.

898
01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.052
One other thing,
little Miss Smarty-pants,

899
01:09:24.117 --> 01:09:28.395
I do not wear a size 14 shoe...

900
01:09:28.454 --> 01:09:32.027
and I don't
much care for parades,

901
01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:35.698
bedsheets or otherwise.

902
01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.649
Hey. What's the matter?

903
01:09:52.712 --> 01:09:56.125
It was Frank.
He saw the baby.

904
01:09:56.182 --> 01:09:59.288
- You sure it was him?
- Yes, I'm sure.

905
01:09:59.352 --> 01:10:02.265
So that's why those
Kluxers were here.

906
01:10:02.322 --> 01:10:05.667
Let me take him.

907
01:10:07.093 --> 01:10:11.303
Don't worry. I mean, if he's
dumb enough to come back here,

908
01:10:11.364 --> 01:10:14.277
Grady and the Alabama boys
will take care of him.

909
01:10:14.334 --> 01:10:18.373
If they don't,
I'll think of somethin'.

910
01:10:18.438 --> 01:10:21.351
Don't take
any chances.

911
01:10:21.407 --> 01:10:24.718
Promise me you won't do
anythin' crazy, no matter what.

912
01:10:24.777 --> 01:10:28.350
Me?
Not me.

913
01:10:30.416 --> 01:10:33.795
I'm gonna
put him down.

914
01:10:33.853 --> 01:10:35.730
Hey little Buddy

915
01:10:35.922 --> 01:10:39.165
That was the last
anyone saw of Frank Bennett...

916
01:10:39.225 --> 01:10:41.535
until the night
of the town follies.

917
01:10:41.594 --> 01:10:46.009
Ruth was away at one of the
Reverend Scroggins' many revivals.

918
01:10:46.065 --> 01:10:49.012
One thing a woman expects
when she gets married...

919
01:10:49.068 --> 01:10:51.014
is sympathy.

920
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:53.482
Haven't you got that
since you married me?

921
01:10:53.539 --> 01:10:58.010
I sure have...
from the whole town.

922
01:11:29.042 --> 01:11:32.387
- Hey there!
- You got to come quick.

923
01:11:32.445 --> 01:11:35.619
Well, the show
has hardly begun.

924
01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:38.424
You got to come quick now.
You hear me?

925
01:11:41.154 --> 01:11:43.464
- Run, get help! Run, quick!
- Where's the baby?

926
01:11:43.523 --> 01:11:45.560
Never mind.

927
01:12:04.977 --> 01:12:10.518
Excuse me, sir. I don't believe
you should be goin' anywhere...

928
01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:13.154
with Ruth's baby.

929
01:12:57.897 --> 01:12:59.877
Thank you.

930
01:12:59.932 --> 01:13:02.378
Hi there. What can I do for you boys?

931
01:13:02.435 --> 01:13:04.381
- Idgie.
- Grady.

932
01:13:04.437 --> 01:13:07.611
- This here is Sheriff Curtis Smoote.
- Hi there.

933
01:13:07.673 --> 01:13:10.745
- He's over here from Georgia. He's lookin' for a fella.
- Oh.

934
01:13:13.913 --> 01:13:15.950
- You recognize him?
- No.

935
01:13:16.015 --> 01:13:20.794
That's my husband, but I
haven't seen him in months.

936
01:13:20.853 --> 01:13:24.096
I heard he got run over
by a Brinks armored truck.

937
01:13:24.157 --> 01:13:26.194
What's he done?

938
01:13:26.259 --> 01:13:30.264
Nothin' that we know of. We're tryin'
to find out what's been did to him.

939
01:13:30.329 --> 01:13:33.833
He told his hired man he was
comin' to see his wife and baby,

940
01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:37.905
but he ain't never
showed up back home.

941
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:40.678
Hell, I told him
if he showed up in this town,

942
01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:42.879
we'd all have known.

943
01:13:42.942 --> 01:13:45.388
Looks a little sissified
to me.

944
01:13:45.445 --> 01:13:49.450
From what I hear,
most you boys in Georgia...

945
01:13:49.515 --> 01:13:50.960
are a little light
on your feet

946
01:13:51.017 --> 01:13:54.191
That's the way
I heard it.

947
01:13:54.253 --> 01:13:56.392
Could I interest you
in some pie?

948
01:13:56.456 --> 01:14:00.370
No, ma'am, but that
barbecue sure smells good.

949
01:14:00.426 --> 01:14:03.873
Best damn barbecue
in the state of Alabama.

950
01:14:33.092 --> 01:14:35.732
Here you go.
That's your 4th one today.

951
01:14:35.795 --> 01:14:38.639
I swear you're about
to eat up all my barbecue.

952
01:14:38.698 --> 01:14:44.515
Sit down.

953
01:14:46.105 --> 01:14:48.312
You ain't foolin' me,
girlie girl.

954
01:14:48.374 --> 01:14:51.048
I know who you are.

955
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:54.284
I heard from Bennett's hired hand
that you threatened to kill Frank.

956
01:14:54.347 --> 01:14:57.556
He ain't showed up
dead yet.

957
01:14:57.617 --> 01:15:01.394
But if he does, you in a whole
mess of trouble. You understand?

958
01:15:01.454 --> 01:15:05.527
What we talkin' about
is murder here.

959
01:15:05.591 --> 01:15:08.800
Runnin' afoul of the law
and nobody gets away with that,

960
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:12.673
not even a bunch
of Alabama smart alecks.

961
01:15:12.732 --> 01:15:15.372
If I find so much
as a hair of his head,

962
01:15:15.434 --> 01:15:18.108
I'll arrest you faster
than you can slap a tick,

963
01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:23.745
'cause I'm the law,
and you cant beat the law

964
01:15:43.996 --> 01:15:47.375
Hey there.

965
01:15:47.433 --> 01:15:50.039
Tell me what he said.

966
01:15:50.102 --> 01:15:54.983
Smoote's? I told you.
He said...

967
01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:58.352
that was the best damn
barbecue he ever had.

968
01:15:58.411 --> 01:16:01.153
- That's all?
- No.

969
01:16:01.213 --> 01:16:07.630
- What else?
- He said the pie was pretty good too.

970
01:16:12.558 --> 01:16:15.232
You sure you ain't
never seen this man, boy?

971
01:16:15.294 --> 01:16:18.935
Yes, sir, and I already told ya,
I ain't never seen him.

972
01:16:18.998 --> 01:16:21.501
You'd do anything for
Miss Idgie, wouldn't ya, boy?

973
01:16:23.402 --> 01:16:25.348
Yes, sir.

974
01:16:28.574 --> 01:16:32.181
Would ya kill for her?
Did ya kill for her?

975
01:16:39.552 --> 01:16:41.691
No, sir.

976
01:16:41.754 --> 01:16:46.601
Well, now, maybe one of these
days you'll tell the truth.

977
01:16:48.628 --> 01:16:51.336
Just remember, we hang
lyin' niggers in Georgia...

978
01:16:51.397 --> 01:16:54.378
just as fast as
they do in Alabama.

979
01:16:54.433 --> 01:16:58.210
Yes, sir, I remember.

980
01:17:35.775 --> 01:17:40.224
Sorry.

981
01:17:40.279 --> 01:17:45.228
- What are ya doin' in here?
- No milk in the house.

982
01:17:45.284 --> 01:17:47.389
Where were you?

983
01:17:47.453 --> 01:17:50.400
Takin' care of business,
havin' a good time.

984
01:17:53.125 --> 01:17:56.698
I've been thinkin'
maybe I should move on...

985
01:17:56.762 --> 01:17:59.242
because of Frank
and all.

986
01:17:59.298 --> 01:18:04.247
I just don't want
you to feel like...

987
01:18:04.303 --> 01:18:07.250
you have
to look out for us.

988
01:18:07.306 --> 01:18:09.752
I just...

989
01:18:09.809 --> 01:18:12.050
don't want to be selfish,
that's all.

990
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:14.455
Maybe if I wasn't here,
you'd settle down.

991
01:18:14.513 --> 01:18:19.428
I'm as settled
as I ever hope to be.

992
01:18:34.033 --> 01:18:38.743
Then... why can't you
tell me where you were?

993
01:18:48.848 --> 01:18:52.352
I had a dream...
the other night.

994
01:18:52.418 --> 01:18:57.731
I dreamt that
Buddy was gone.

995
01:18:57.790 --> 01:19:02.261
I ran to his crib and there
he was, sleepin' like an angel.

996
01:19:02.328 --> 01:19:04.968
You know,
I thanked God...

997
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:08.011
for lettin' me
still have Buddy.

998
01:19:08.067 --> 01:19:10.638
And I remembered...

999
01:19:10.703 --> 01:19:14.446
havin' the same reaction
after Frank would beat me,

1000
01:19:14.507 --> 01:19:18.216
thankin' the Lord for givin' me
the strength to take it.

1001
01:19:18.277 --> 01:19:20.450
And I remembered...

1002
01:19:20.513 --> 01:19:24.962
thankin' the Lord
for each day my mother lived,

1003
01:19:26.018 --> 01:19:29.329
even when she was
spittin' up blood...

1004
01:19:29.388 --> 01:19:33.268
and prayin' for me
to kill her.

1005
01:19:33.325 --> 01:19:37.432
I looked in my mother's eyes
pleadin' for me to help her...

1006
01:19:37.496 --> 01:19:42.002
and all I could do
was pray.

1007
01:19:45.771 --> 01:19:49.776
While you were gone,
as I was holdin' Buddy,

1008
01:19:49.842 --> 01:19:54.313
I thought if that bastard,
Frank Bennett...

1009
01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:59.090
ever tries
to take my child,

1010
01:19:59.151 --> 01:20:02.598
I won't pray.

1011
01:20:02.655 --> 01:20:05.261
I'll break his neck.

1012
01:20:08.594 --> 01:20:12.633
Ruth, you don't have to worry
about Frank Bennett anymore.

1013
01:20:12.698 --> 01:20:16.339
How can you say that?
It's his child too.

1014
01:20:16.402 --> 01:20:19.144
He won't give up
on his blood.

1015
01:20:19.205 --> 01:20:22.584
I'm only gonna
tell you this one time.

1016
01:20:24.476 --> 01:20:27.923
Frank Bennett won't
be bothering you no more.

1017
01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:30.756
Understand?

1018
01:20:32.785 --> 01:20:35.197
You killed him,

1019
01:20:35.254 --> 01:20:38.133
didn't you?

1020
01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:40.466
No!

1021
01:20:47.366 --> 01:20:49.312
You don't believe me.

1022
01:20:49.368 --> 01:20:53.942
Right now, I don't know
what to believe.

1023
01:20:56.408 --> 01:20:59.719
Believe me when I tell ya
I don't want ya to move out.

1024
01:21:25.304 --> 01:21:28.649
Finally.

1025
01:21:28.707 --> 01:21:32.450
Thanks, I've been
out here all day.

1026
01:21:59.605 --> 01:22:02.017
Excuse me.
I was waiting for that space.

1027
01:22:02.074 --> 01:22:07.023
- Yeah? Tough!
- Face it, lady, we're younger and faster.

1028
01:22:27.566 --> 01:22:30.479
Towanda.

1029
01:22:33.973 --> 01:22:37.011
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

1030
01:22:37.076 --> 01:22:41.991
Yeah!
Whooo!

1031
01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:48.832
Towanda!

1032
01:22:53.692 --> 01:22:56.502
Yes, ma'am.

1033
01:22:56.562 --> 01:22:59.270
Whoooo!

1034
01:23:02.267 --> 01:23:05.771
- Help, someone!
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?

1035
01:23:05.838 --> 01:23:10.787
Face it, girls. I'm older,
and I have more insurance.

1036
01:23:19.385 --> 01:23:23.026
I never get mad, Mrs.
Threadgoode. Never!

1037
01:23:23.088 --> 01:23:25.659
The way I was raised
it was bad manners.

1038
01:23:25.724 --> 01:23:28.898
Well, I got mad
and it felt terrific.

1039
01:23:28.961 --> 01:23:32.272
I felt like I could beat
the shit outta all those punks!

1040
01:23:32.331 --> 01:23:35.073
Excuse my language.
just beat 'em to a pulp!

1041
01:23:35.134 --> 01:23:37.273
Beat 'em till
they begged for mercy.

1042
01:23:37.336 --> 01:23:39.373
Towanda, the avenger!

1043
01:23:39.438 --> 01:23:42.476
After I wipe out
all the punks of this world,

1044
01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:45.021
I'll take on the wife beaters,
like Frank Bennett,

1045
01:23:45.077 --> 01:23:48.650
and machine gun
their genitals.

1046
01:23:48.714 --> 01:23:50.990
Towanda
will go on the rampage.

1047
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:53.758
I'll put tiny bombs
in Penthouse and Playboy...

1048
01:23:53.819 --> 01:23:56.026
so they'll explode
when you open 'em.

1049
01:23:56.088 --> 01:24:00.559
I'll ban all fashion models
who weigh less than 130 pounds.

1050
01:24:02.361 --> 01:24:05.934
I'll give half the military
budget to people over 65...

1051
01:24:05.998 --> 01:24:08.740
and declare wrinkles
sexually desirable.

1052
01:24:08.801 --> 01:24:13.443
Towanda, righter of wrongs,
queen beyond compare!

1053
01:24:13.505 --> 01:24:16.816
How many of them
hormones you takin', honey?

1054
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:34.794
what I can't
understand is...

1055
01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:38.467
how in the hell
you can hit someone...

1056
01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:40.771
six times
by accident.

1057
01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:43.871
Oh, Ed, don't make
such a big deal about it.

1058
01:24:50.275 --> 01:24:54.815
- What the hell is this?
- A low cholesterol meal.

1059
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.826
Happy Valentine's.

1060
01:25:00.085 --> 01:25:03.032
My God!
Are you tryin' to kill me?

1061
01:25:03.088 --> 01:25:06.365
If I was gonna kill ya,
I'd use my hands.

1062
01:25:23.275 --> 01:25:25.881
I'm worried about
my little friend Evelyn.

1063
01:25:25.944 --> 01:25:28.515
She said her husband...

1064
01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:30.890
will just be watching
his sports on TV...

1065
01:25:30.949 --> 01:25:34.123
and she has an urge to hit him
in the head with a baseball bat.

1066
01:25:34.186 --> 01:25:37.065
Hell, that
seems normal to me.

1067
01:25:37.122 --> 01:25:39.124
- Hi Janeen.
- Mm-hmm

1068
01:25:39.191 --> 01:25:41.671
Mrs. Threadgoode, would
you like some crudites?

1069
01:25:41.727 --> 01:25:46.142
Thank you, but this raw stuff
don't sit good with me.

1070
01:25:46.198 --> 01:25:50.374
Mrs. Threadgoode, you
have to tell me something.

1071
01:25:50.435 --> 01:25:55.214
- Did Idgie murder Frank Bennett or not?
- Hold your horses, honey.

1072
01:25:55.274 --> 01:25:58.312
Where were we?

1073
01:25:58.377 --> 01:26:01.119
You didn't kill Ed,
did ya?

1074
01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:04.855
- Not yet.
- Oh, good.

1075
01:26:04.917 --> 01:26:09.593
Anyway, five years had passed
since Frank Bennett disappeared.

1076
01:26:09.655 --> 01:26:14.365
And Smokey Lonesome been missin'
ever since that same terrible night.

1077
01:26:14.426 --> 01:26:17.498
I member the day
when he showed up again.

1078
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:20.410
My God, son.

1079
01:26:20.465 --> 01:26:22.638
You're the spittin'
image of Ruth.

1080
01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:26.046
Buddy Threadgood,Jr.
Nice to meet you, sir.

1081
01:26:26.104 --> 01:26:28.482
Well, sir,
Smokey Lonesome.

1082
01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:31.749
Curtis Smoote was making one of
his visits to Whistle Stop, Alabama,

1083
01:26:31.810 --> 01:26:34.620
still huntin' and peckin'
for any scrap of evidence...

1084
01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.718
about Frank Bennett's
whereabouts.

1085
01:26:37.783 --> 01:26:40.286
Who wants to begin?
Oh, I do.

1086
01:26:40.352 --> 01:26:42.195
- I do, Miss Ruth.
- Thank you.

1087
01:26:42.254 --> 01:26:45.531
We'll begin
on page five.

1088
01:26:45.591 --> 01:26:48.868
Life has a funny way
of working things out.

1089
01:26:48.927 --> 01:26:50.770
Well, hey there!

1090
01:26:50.829 --> 01:26:54.402
- Smokey!
- Idgie?

1091
01:26:54.466 --> 01:26:58.004
Smokey Lonesome!
If it isn't old home week.

1092
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:01.677
- How are you?
- Well, I'm rattlin' but I'm rollin'.

1093
01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:05.313
- What brings you to these parts?
- Smell of good cookin'.

1094
01:27:05.377 --> 01:27:06.981
Hey, Smokey.

1095
01:27:07.045 --> 01:27:10.117
- Sipsey.
- Let me fix you some lunch.

1096
01:27:10.182 --> 01:27:14.597
You know just about everybody
except Curtis Smoote.

1097
01:27:14.653 --> 01:27:18.157
He's the officer from
over at Valdosta, Georgia.

1098
01:27:18.223 --> 01:27:22.330
He's been lookin' for the same man for
almost 5 years. Very stubborn fella.

1099
01:27:22.394 --> 01:27:26.342
He loves our barbecue.

1100
01:27:26.398 --> 01:27:27.741
Mommy! Mommy!

1101
01:27:35.907 --> 01:27:37.853
Buddy.

1102
01:27:37.909 --> 01:27:39.855
Everybody
outta the way.

1103
01:27:39.911 --> 01:27:43.688
Give him here.
Let him go. I've got him.

1104
01:27:45.651 --> 01:27:47.858
Come on. You're
gonna be all right.

1105
01:27:47.919 --> 01:27:50.263
Open the door!

1106
01:27:50.322 --> 01:27:54.395
Put him in the car.
It's all right, honey

1107
01:28:15.614 --> 01:28:17.525
I can understand...

1108
01:28:17.582 --> 01:28:20.119
having a funeral
for an arm.

1109
01:28:20.185 --> 01:28:23.723
I just don't know why she
insists on callin' him "Stump."?

1110
01:28:23.789 --> 01:28:26.793
She say everybody else gonna
be callin' him that...

1111
01:28:26.858 --> 01:28:30.965
so we might just as well
be the first.

1112
01:28:31.029 --> 01:28:35.205
Okay, ice cream
and cake for everybody.

1113
01:28:35.267 --> 01:28:37.076
Go on.

1114
01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.345
My daddy always used to say there
was a separate God for children.

1115
01:28:49.214 --> 01:28:52.752
The good Lord was watchin'
over stump that day.

1116
01:28:52.818 --> 01:28:56.197
But then it started to rain
that month.

1117
01:28:56.254 --> 01:29:01.101
It rained and rained and it
flooded parts of Whistle Stop.

1118
01:29:01.159 --> 01:29:06.302
That's why Grady's deputies stumbled
on to Frank Bennett's pickup truck,

1119
01:29:06.365 --> 01:29:10.370
and I just knew Idgie'd
never get out of this mess.

1120
01:29:10.435 --> 01:29:14.212
Now, you in or out? Remember,
I didn't take any cards.

1121
01:29:14.272 --> 01:29:16.718
Look at me and
let me see your face.

1122
01:29:16.775 --> 01:29:19.016
Idgie, I have to talk
to you. You're bluffin'.

1123
01:29:19.077 --> 01:29:22.854
Why don't you sit in? I'll deal
you a new hand. Gladys won't mind.

1124
01:29:22.914 --> 01:29:25.019
In private, Idgie.

1125
01:29:25.083 --> 01:29:28.121
Excuse us, Ruth.

1126
01:29:28.186 --> 01:29:32.464
- A-ha. - I'm just tryin' to teach
you not to fall for any tricks.

1127
01:29:32.524 --> 01:29:35.164
You're doin'
a great job.

1128
01:29:43.969 --> 01:29:46.210
What's your hurry?

1129
01:29:46.271 --> 01:29:49.514
And what is
so important?

1130
01:29:49.574 --> 01:29:51.815
What's that?

1131
01:29:51.877 --> 01:29:55.222
Somebody found Frank Bennett's
truck in the river.

1132
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.454
What's that got
to do with me?

1133
01:29:58.517 --> 01:30:02.488
Officially, you and Big George
are under arrest for murder.

1134
01:30:02.554 --> 01:30:05.467
You're in my custody
until tomorrow.

1135
01:30:05.524 --> 01:30:08.232
I'm supposed to take you to
Georgia first thing in the morning.

1136
01:30:10.295 --> 01:30:12.502
Unless, of course-

1137
01:30:12.564 --> 01:30:15.306
Well, some people have
been known to pack up...

1138
01:30:15.367 --> 01:30:19.782
and sneak out of town
in the middle of the night.

1139
01:30:21.506 --> 01:30:24.077
What about Big George?

1140
01:30:24.142 --> 01:30:26.884
Well, the way
I figure it,

1141
01:30:26.945 --> 01:30:30.188
they'd be satisfied
if they had him.

1142
01:30:30.248 --> 01:30:32.319
Idgie.
this is serious.

1143
01:30:32.384 --> 01:30:34.990
We're talkin'
murder of a white man.

1144
01:30:35.053 --> 01:30:37.294
Someone's
gonna have to pay.

1145
01:30:37.355 --> 01:30:40.199
Nobody wants
to hang a woman.

1146
01:30:41.726 --> 01:30:43.728
No deal.

1147
01:30:43.795 --> 01:30:46.401
Idgie, I know how you feel
about Big George.

1148
01:30:46.465 --> 01:30:48.604
Hell, we all do.

1149
01:30:48.667 --> 01:30:51.841
But these just
the facts of life.

1150
01:30:54.272 --> 01:30:56.548
I can't do that.

1151
01:30:56.608 --> 01:30:59.384
Take me to jail
if you have to.

1152
01:30:59.444 --> 01:31:01.947
Well, that's what
I thought you'd say...

1153
01:31:02.013 --> 01:31:04.425
'cause you're absolutely,
unconditionally,

1154
01:31:04.483 --> 01:31:08.989
positively the most stubborn
person I've known in my life.

1155
01:31:10.822 --> 01:31:15.532
Idgie and Big George went to
the county jail in Valdosta...

1156
01:31:15.594 --> 01:31:19.406
to await trial for
the murder of Frank Bennett.

1157
01:31:19.464 --> 01:31:21.603
They didn't have
to wait too long.

1158
01:31:21.666 --> 01:31:25.079
- Did you know Frank Bennett?
- No, sir.

1159
01:31:25.136 --> 01:31:27.548
You mean, you
never met the man...

1160
01:31:27.606 --> 01:31:32.146
- whose wife, Ruth, is your business partner?
- That's right.

1161
01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:35.054
You never threatened to kill
Frank Bennett at his home...

1162
01:31:35.113 --> 01:31:38.822
in front of his hired man
in June of 1932?

1163
01:31:38.884 --> 01:31:43.924
- The same Frank Bennett you did not know.
- Oh, that was me, all right.

1164
01:31:43.989 --> 01:31:47.232
I thought you wanted to know if we'd
ever met... and the answer is no.

1165
01:31:47.292 --> 01:31:49.863
Um, I threatened
to kill him,

1166
01:31:49.928 --> 01:31:54.104
but we were never, what you
might say properly introduced.

1167
01:31:54.165 --> 01:31:58.170
Is it not true that in September
of 1932 you came to Valdosta...

1168
01:31:58.236 --> 01:32:02.082
and took Frank Bennett's wife and
child back to Alabama with you?

1169
01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.620
Um... just the wife.
The child came later.

1170
01:32:04.676 --> 01:32:08.146
- How much later?
- The usual. Nine months.

1171
01:32:08.213 --> 01:32:11.092
I suggest
that you bribed...

1172
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:16.462
this poor, weak woman with
promises of liquor and money,

1173
01:32:16.521 --> 01:32:20.264
and she lost control
of her senses momentarily.

1174
01:32:20.325 --> 01:32:23.329
When her husband came back
to get her and take her home,

1175
01:32:23.395 --> 01:32:28.037
you and your colored man
murdered him in cold blood.

1176
01:32:29.234 --> 01:32:30.838
No, sir.

1177
01:32:30.902 --> 01:32:36.181
Well, where were you on the
night of September 30, 1933?

1178
01:32:36.241 --> 01:32:38.551
I was at the town hall
doing a show.

1179
01:32:38.610 --> 01:32:41.716
- And after that?
- I was at my mother's house.

1180
01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:44.317
Oh, yeah?
Who was with you?

1181
01:32:44.382 --> 01:32:48.728
- Just Big George and myself
- What about your mother? Can she confirm that?

1182
01:32:48.787 --> 01:32:51.063
No, sir.
She died a year ago.

1183
01:32:51.122 --> 01:32:53.625
I'm sorry to hear that.

1184
01:32:53.692 --> 01:32:57.401
But do you expect 12 intelligent
men to believe you,

1185
01:32:57.462 --> 01:33:00.102
although one witness is dead and
the other is a colored man,

1186
01:33:00.165 --> 01:33:03.578
known to be a worthless,
no-good, lying nigger?

1187
01:33:03.635 --> 01:33:05.911
You expect these men
to take your word for it...

1188
01:33:05.971 --> 01:33:08.645
just because
you say so?

1189
01:33:08.707 --> 01:33:13.247
That's right, you gump-faced,
blown-up, baboon-assed bastard!

1190
01:33:13.311 --> 01:33:16.781
One more outburst
like that...

1191
01:33:16.848 --> 01:33:20.352
and I'll hold you in contempt
of court. You understand?

1192
01:33:20.418 --> 01:33:23.228
Yes, sir.

1193
01:33:24.923 --> 01:33:28.496
- Oh, Lord.
- Next witness.

1194
01:33:31.062 --> 01:33:32.541
Did you know that
you were pregnant'...

1195
01:33:32.597 --> 01:33:35.544
at the time
you left Valdosta?

1196
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.546
Yes.

1197
01:33:37.602 --> 01:33:41.209
And yet, you tell us
ave-rand over...

1198
01:33:41.272 --> 01:33:45.846
that you went with this
woman... willingly?

1199
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:50.120
Yes. I wouldn't raise
my child with Frank Bennett.

1200
01:33:50.181 --> 01:33:52.286
But why?

1201
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:56.560
- Did this woman promise you money?
- No.

1202
01:33:56.621 --> 01:33:59.192
A bigger home?

1203
01:33:59.257 --> 01:34:02.363
No. No.

1204
01:34:02.427 --> 01:34:05.067
Then tell us,
Mrs. Bennett,

1205
01:34:05.130 --> 01:34:07.667
why would a respectable
Christian woman...

1206
01:34:07.732 --> 01:34:10.542
- go anywhere with this Idgie Threadgoode...
- I object.

1207
01:34:10.602 --> 01:34:12.741
Whose reputation
is known far and wide...

1208
01:34:12.804 --> 01:34:15.045
As a notorious Afar
and drunkard?

1209
01:34:15.106 --> 01:34:17.416
- Objection!
- Sustained!

1210
01:34:20.812 --> 01:34:23.122
Why did you leave...

1211
01:34:23.181 --> 01:34:27.152
with Idgie Threadgoode
that day?

1212
01:34:28.553 --> 01:34:31.864
Answer the question,
Mrs. Bennett.

1213
01:34:32.724 --> 01:34:35.762
Because she-

1214
01:34:38.329 --> 01:34:40.935
She's the best friend
I ever had,

1215
01:34:40.999 --> 01:34:43.104
and I love her.

1216
01:34:43.802 --> 01:34:46.715
Thank you, Mrs. Bennett.
That will be all.

1217
01:34:46.771 --> 01:34:49.615
The defense calls
as its last witness...

1218
01:34:49.674 --> 01:34:52.416
the Rev.
Herbert Scroggins.

1219
01:34:53.745 --> 01:34:56.749
Place your right hand
on the Bible, please.

1220
01:34:56.815 --> 01:35:00.024
I brought my own,
if you don't mind.

1221
01:35:00.085 --> 01:35:04.158
You swear to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

1222
01:35:04.222 --> 01:35:06.224
I do.

1223
01:35:08.259 --> 01:35:12.503
You have information
about the whereabouts...

1224
01:35:12.564 --> 01:35:16.171
of Idgie Threadgoode and her
colored man, known as Big George,

1225
01:35:16.234 --> 01:35:20.011
on the night
of September 30, 1933?

1226
01:35:20.071 --> 01:35:22.051
Yes, sir,
I do.

1227
01:35:22.107 --> 01:35:24.553
It has been
suggested here...

1228
01:35:24.609 --> 01:35:28.079
that she and her colored man
were at her mother's house.

1229
01:35:28.146 --> 01:35:32.390
- Can you confirm that?
- No, sir. That is a lie.

1230
01:35:32.450 --> 01:35:35.192
Oh, shit.

1231
01:35:35.253 --> 01:35:38.496
It has been my habit
to write all the dates...

1232
01:35:38.556 --> 01:35:41.503
Of the activities of
the church in my Bible.

1233
01:35:41.559 --> 01:35:46.235
I show that the night
of September 30, 1933...

1234
01:35:46.297 --> 01:35:49.335
was the start of our
annual revival...

1235
01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.176
down at the
Baptist campground.

1236
01:35:52.237 --> 01:35:54.342
Sister Threadgoode
was there...

1237
01:35:54.405 --> 01:35:58.444
along with her hired man,
George Pullman,

1238
01:35:58.510 --> 01:36:02.652
who was in charge of the
barbecue as he has been...

1239
01:36:02.714 --> 01:36:05.388
- for the last ten years.
- Objection.

1240
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:09.990
That doesn't mean anything. Murder could've
taken place any time the next couple of clays.

1241
01:36:10.054 --> 01:36:15.094
- Have you ever been to one of our revivals, sir?
- Well, no.

1242
01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:17.231
Do you attend church
regularly, sir?

1243
01:36:17.295 --> 01:36:19.502
'Course I do.

1244
01:36:19.564 --> 01:36:24.104
Good. Well, maybe if you
attended one of our revivals,

1245
01:36:24.169 --> 01:36:26.547
you'd know
they last three days...

1246
01:36:26.604 --> 01:36:28.948
and three nights,
Your Honor.

1247
01:36:31.209 --> 01:36:34.190
Approach the bench.

1248
01:36:34.245 --> 01:36:38.955
Percy, it don't look like
you got a case at all.

1249
01:36:39.017 --> 01:36:41.588
In the first place,
there's no body.

1250
01:36:41.653 --> 01:36:44.930
Second, we got us a preacher
nobody's gonna dispute.

1251
01:36:44.989 --> 01:36:49.199
- But, Your Honor- - I'm tellin'
you. What you got is a lot of nothing.

1252
01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:52.503
I say Frank Bennett
got himself drunk,

1253
01:36:52.564 --> 01:36:56.740
drove into the river and
was long ago eaten up...

1254
01:36:56.801 --> 01:36:59.975
and I don't give
a good goddamn!

1255
01:37:00.038 --> 01:37:03.508
What we got here is a
case of accidental death.

1256
01:37:03.575 --> 01:37:05.213
Case dismissed.

1257
01:37:05.276 --> 01:37:07.722
Whoo!

1258
01:37:14.652 --> 01:37:17.565
See you in church,
Sister?

1259
01:37:18.456 --> 01:37:20.697
Reverend.

1260
01:37:20.758 --> 01:37:25.070
I can't believe he
actually swore on a Bible.

1261
01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:27.075
Well, not really.

1262
01:37:27.131 --> 01:37:29.133
If that judge
had looked closer,

1263
01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.272
he'd have seen it was really
a copy of Moby Dick.

1264
01:37:34.305 --> 01:37:38.720
- But why did he do it?
- For the sheer joy of seeing you in church again...

1265
01:37:38.776 --> 01:37:41.620
which I suggested to him
might be your penance.

1266
01:37:41.679 --> 01:37:44.319
- You didn't promise him, did you?
- Yes, ma'am, I did.

1267
01:37:44.382 --> 01:37:46.328
And I never
break my word.

1268
01:37:46.384 --> 01:37:50.764
If I live 1,000 years,
I will never forgive you.

1269
01:37:50.822 --> 01:37:54.998
I don't know what's worse,
church or jail.

1270
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:09.110
There now.
Don't you look pretty?

1271
01:38:09.173 --> 01:38:11.312
Oh, yes, honey.

1272
01:38:11.376 --> 01:38:16.052
You'll have me lookin' like
Ginger Rogers before you're done.

1273
01:38:16.114 --> 01:38:20.358
Don't let Mr. Dunaway see me.
He's liable to go wild.

1274
01:38:21.853 --> 01:38:25.096
I'm glad to see
you're in a good mood.

1275
01:38:25.156 --> 01:38:28.296
You've slimmed down quite a bit
in the last few weeks.

1276
01:38:28.359 --> 01:38:32.671
I'm just so happy Big George
and Idgie got off.

1277
01:38:32.730 --> 01:38:35.734
I would have killed Frank
Bennett if I could've.

1278
01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.337
Did anybody really
think she did it?

1279
01:38:38.403 --> 01:38:41.043
Some said yes,
some said no.

1280
01:38:41.105 --> 01:38:44.245
'Course the only one who really
knew was Frank Bennett.

1281
01:38:44.309 --> 01:38:49.725
And you know what they say.
Dead men tell no tales.

1282
01:38:50.381 --> 01:38:52.691
Towanda-a-a!

1283
01:39:15.974 --> 01:39:19.012
Evelyn, what in the hell
are you doing?

1284
01:39:19.077 --> 01:39:21.990
I need some light
and air.

1285
01:39:22.046 --> 01:39:25.255
Why don't you take one of
your walks or your jog...

1286
01:39:25.316 --> 01:39:28.854
or whatever it is
you do?

1287
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.833
There's no dinner
either!

1288
01:39:31.889 --> 01:39:36.338
Ed, you have any idea why I've
been goin' to all these classes?

1289
01:39:36.394 --> 01:39:39.932
- No.
- I've been trying to save our marriage.

1290
01:39:39.998 --> 01:39:42.035
What's the point
of my tryin'...

1291
01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:46.776
if you're gonna sit on
your butt drinking beer...

1292
01:39:46.838 --> 01:39:49.682
and watching baseball,
basketball, football...

1293
01:39:49.741 --> 01:39:52.881
bowling and hockey
and golf...

1294
01:39:52.944 --> 01:39:56.824
and Challenge
of the Gladiators?

1295
01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:07.060
Mrs. Couch, I'm Sue,
Mrs. Otis' daughter-in-law.

1296
01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:10.572
How are you? I've heard about
you from Mrs. Threadgoode.

1297
01:40:10.628 --> 01:40:14.337
She is so sweet. She's been
lookin' after my mother-in-law.

1298
01:40:14.399 --> 01:40:17.175
Now, how is Mrs. Otis doin', by the way?

1299
01:40:17.235 --> 01:40:21.706
Much better, thank you. It takes
time getting used to a strange place.

1300
01:40:21.773 --> 01:40:25.812
I'm glad to hear it. Mrs.
Threadgoode's been anxious to get home.

1301
01:40:25.877 --> 01:40:30.087
Mrs. Couch, Mrs. Threadgoode
doesn't have a house anymore.

1302
01:40:30.148 --> 01:40:33.618
- They tore that down.
- What?

1303
01:40:33.684 --> 01:40:37.928
They had to. It was falling
apart, and it was condemned.

1304
01:40:37.989 --> 01:40:40.936
Oh, no.

1305
01:40:40.992 --> 01:40:45.202
- Does she know that?
- No, well, we didn't see any point in telling her.

1306
01:40:45.263 --> 01:40:47.766
It would just break her heart,
poor old thing

1307
01:40:47.832 --> 01:40:51.780
But I am so glad
I got a chance to meet you.

1308
01:40:51.836 --> 01:40:55.045
You take care of yourself now.
Bye-bye.

1309
01:42:05.009 --> 01:42:07.319
Oh, Evelyn. hey!

1310
01:42:07.378 --> 01:42:09.858
Hey-

1311
01:42:09.914 --> 01:42:12.292
Do you like
my roses?

1312
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:15.695
Since I can't get home
to look at my own roses...

1313
01:42:15.753 --> 01:42:18.131
I made myself
a paper garden.

1314
01:42:18.189 --> 01:42:21.693
- Got everything but the bugs.
- They're lovely.

1315
01:42:21.759 --> 01:42:25.036
- You been here long?
- Happy birthday!

1316
01:42:25.096 --> 01:42:27.599
- Oh!
- I shouldn't have woken you up.

1317
01:42:27.665 --> 01:42:31.943
'Course you should've. Don't you never let
me sleep through a visitor's day, honey.

1318
01:42:32.003 --> 01:42:36.748
- I look forward to them all week.
- So do I, Mrs. Threadgoode.

1319
01:42:36.807 --> 01:42:40.152
Oh! I can't believe
you remembered.

1320
01:42:40.211 --> 01:42:44.421
You made me
fried green tomatoes!

1321
01:42:46.851 --> 01:42:48.888
Mmm!
They're delicious.

1322
01:42:48.953 --> 01:42:52.298
- It's your recipe. Are they cold?
- No. They're just the way...

1323
01:42:52.356 --> 01:42:56.634
- we used to have 'em at the Whistle Stop Cafe.
- Mmm!

1324
01:42:56.694 --> 01:43:00.642
You couldn't be sweeter to me
if you was my own daughter.

1325
01:43:00.698 --> 01:43:02.871
Here's your napkin.

1326
01:43:02.934 --> 01:43:04.971
And wait-wait-wait.

1327
01:43:05.036 --> 01:43:07.607
Queen, queen.

1328
01:43:10.775 --> 01:43:14.917
You know,
I don't feel 83.

1329
01:43:14.979 --> 01:43:19.121
It sorta slipped up on me.

1330
01:43:21.219 --> 01:43:24.666
I never expected
to live this long.

1331
01:43:24.722 --> 01:43:30.331
'Course, the Lord takes us home
when he wants us.

1332
01:43:39.337 --> 01:43:42.978
Are you all right?

1333
01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.384
I was thinking
about Ruth.

1334
01:43:45.443 --> 01:43:48.253
After the trial
was over,

1335
01:43:48.312 --> 01:43:50.519
Everything went back
to normal...

1336
01:43:50.581 --> 01:43:54.358
till that fall
when Ruth lost her appetite.

1337
01:43:54.418 --> 01:43:56.989
By the time Doc Hadley
looked at her,

1338
01:43:57.054 --> 01:44:01.264
he said the cancer was so bad
she only had a couple of weeks.

1339
01:44:01.325 --> 01:44:04.067
Well, we moved her
to the Threadgoode house...

1340
01:44:04.128 --> 01:44:08.975
and put her downstairs
so she'd be more comfortable.

1341
01:44:09.033 --> 01:44:13.539
Sipsey moved in with her
and never left her side.

1342
01:44:13.604 --> 01:44:15.743
Hold on, baby
I'm right here.

1343
01:44:15.806 --> 01:44:20.482
Idgie just prayed
for a miracle.

1344
01:44:39.764 --> 01:44:43.234
Now, listen to me.

1345
01:44:43.301 --> 01:44:45.838
Make sure he graduates.

1346
01:44:45.903 --> 01:44:50.113
And don't... let him
come to the funeral.

1347
01:44:50.174 --> 01:44:52.848
I don't want him going
through that mess.

1348
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:56.221
Would you quit talkin'
like that?

1349
01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:58.783
What funeral?

1350
01:44:58.849 --> 01:45:01.227
You're gonna be back on
your feet feelin' just fine...

1351
01:45:01.285 --> 01:45:03.959
in just a few days.

1352
01:45:04.021 --> 01:45:06.934
Just you wait.

1353
01:45:06.991 --> 01:45:10.131
Oh, what's the matter,
son?

1354
01:45:15.966 --> 01:45:19.641
Well,
let's go for a walk.

1355
01:45:20.338 --> 01:45:21.942
Did you get
into a fight?

1356
01:45:22.006 --> 01:45:24.714
I got punched
in the nose.

1357
01:45:24.775 --> 01:45:28.279
I can't play
like everyone else.

1358
01:45:28.346 --> 01:45:31.884
Did I ever tell you the
story about... the oysters?

1359
01:45:31.949 --> 01:45:34.429
All the millions of 'em
just lying around-

1360
01:45:34.485 --> 01:45:39.332
- And God put sand in one of 'em, and it makes a pearl.
- Oh.

1361
01:45:41.092 --> 01:45:43.766
Did I ever tell you about
Eva's three-legged dog?

1362
01:45:43.828 --> 01:45:45.933
How it never felt sorry
for itself...

1363
01:45:45.996 --> 01:45:49.637
and howl ought to be smarter than a
dumb dog and not feel sorry for myself.

1364
01:45:51.435 --> 01:45:54.780
You listen to everything
I say, don't you?

1365
01:45:54.839 --> 01:45:57.820
You get real mad at me
when I don't.

1366
01:45:57.875 --> 01:45:59.582
Well,

1367
01:46:02.046 --> 01:46:05.050
you know about
your mama.

1368
01:46:05.116 --> 01:46:07.619
She's sick.

1369
01:46:07.685 --> 01:46:09.722
Mm-hmm.

1370
01:46:11.255 --> 01:46:14.702
See, now is the time
for courage.

1371
01:46:14.759 --> 01:46:18.468
I guess you already know
that there are...

1372
01:46:18.529 --> 01:46:21.533
angels masqueradin' as people
walkin' around this planet,

1373
01:46:21.599 --> 01:46:24.773
and your mom's
the bravest one of those.

1374
01:46:29.039 --> 01:46:31.144
Come here.

1375
01:46:38.849 --> 01:46:41.261
Mama, I can hit!
You should see me.

1376
01:46:41.318 --> 01:46:44.128
Idgie, she hit me in
the back with a curveball.

1377
01:46:44.188 --> 01:46:46.361
I didn't duck,
and I hardly cried.

1378
01:46:46.424 --> 01:46:49.894
She hit you?

1379
01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:53.965
Well, she did that
to me once too,

1380
01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:56.807
but I think
I did cry.

1381
01:46:58.702 --> 01:47:02.673
Mama, I'm sorry
if you're sad.

1382
01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:05.050
Well,

1383
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:08.215
give me a big kiss then,
and I'll never be sad again.

1384
01:47:15.753 --> 01:47:18.666
And you best not be sad
neither.

1385
01:47:18.722 --> 01:47:21.965
You understand?

1386
01:47:22.026 --> 01:47:23.972
You promise?

1387
01:47:24.028 --> 01:47:26.065
Promise.

1388
01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:30.078
Attaboy.
You go and wash up.

1389
01:47:53.891 --> 01:47:55.928
Sweet baby.

1390
01:47:59.897 --> 01:48:03.174
You two
be alone now.

1391
01:48:03.868 --> 01:48:07.543
Hey, girl.

1392
01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:12.111
No.

1393
01:48:14.044 --> 01:48:17.116
That's nice.

1394
01:48:18.115 --> 01:48:21.824
Will you do one thing
for me?

1395
01:48:21.886 --> 01:48:25.493
- Yeah, anything.
- Be good to yourself.

1396
01:48:25.556 --> 01:48:28.503
Even...

1397
01:48:28.559 --> 01:48:31.096
settle down if
you can find someone...

1398
01:48:31.161 --> 01:48:33.903
who can beat you
in poker.

1399
01:48:41.605 --> 01:48:46.577
There's so many things
I want to say to you.

1400
01:48:46.644 --> 01:48:49.181
No.

1401
01:48:50.014 --> 01:48:52.688
I love your stories.

1402
01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:55.697
Tell me a story,
Idgie.

1403
01:48:58.556 --> 01:49:02.402
Oh, God.

1404
01:49:02.459 --> 01:49:05.565
Go on,
you old' bee charmer.

1405
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:09.304
Tell me
a good tall tale.

1406
01:49:10.701 --> 01:49:14.410
Tell me the one
about the lake.

1407
01:49:15.706 --> 01:49:20.348
- What lake?
- The one... that used to be here.

1408
01:49:22.479 --> 01:49:24.425
Oh.

1409
01:49:26.483 --> 01:49:30.056
Well, that was
just a lie.

1410
01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:32.896
I know that, fool.

1411
01:49:32.957 --> 01:49:35.028
Tell me anyway.

1412
01:49:35.092 --> 01:49:38.505
Tell me the story.

1413
01:49:40.064 --> 01:49:43.511
Well...

1414
01:49:45.536 --> 01:49:48.016
one time...

1415
01:49:48.072 --> 01:49:50.882
there was this lake.

1416
01:49:55.312 --> 01:49:59.692
And, uh, it was
right outside of town.

1417
01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:05.200
We used to go fishin' and
swimmin' and canoein' in it.

1418
01:50:05.255 --> 01:50:08.498
And see,
one November...

1419
01:50:08.559 --> 01:50:10.869
this big flock of ducks...

1420
01:50:10.928 --> 01:50:15.968
came in and landed
on that lake and, uh,

1421
01:50:16.033 --> 01:50:20.880
and then the temperature dropped so fast
that the lake just froze right there.

1422
01:50:20.938 --> 01:50:23.214
And the, uh,

1423
01:50:23.273 --> 01:50:27.050
the ducks, they...

1424
01:50:27.111 --> 01:50:31.287
flew off, you see,
and took that lake with 'em.

1425
01:50:31.348 --> 01:50:34.591
And, uh.

1426
01:50:34.652 --> 01:50:39.658
Now they say that lake is
somewhere over in Georgia.

1427
01:50:39.723 --> 01:50:42.795
Can you imagine?

1428
01:51:40.484 --> 01:51:43.761
It's all right,
honey.

1429
01:51:43.821 --> 01:51:49.802
Let her go.

1430
01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:54.104
You know,
Miss Ruth was a lady.

1431
01:51:54.164 --> 01:51:57.441
And a lady
always knows...

1432
01:51:57.501 --> 01:52:00.505
when to leave.

1433
01:52:06.009 --> 01:52:10.116
When I think on our
departed sister, Ruth Jamison,

1434
01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:13.286
I'm reminded of our
Lord's Sermon on the Mount...

1435
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:15.830
and how his teachings-

1436
01:52:15.886 --> 01:52:20.335
It's funny how strong
Ruth affected everyone.

1437
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:23.803
even Smokey Lonesome.

1438
01:52:23.861 --> 01:52:26.535
When he died
a few years back...

1439
01:52:26.597 --> 01:52:29.305
he had one possession
on him,

1440
01:52:29.366 --> 01:52:31.972
A picture of Ruth.

1441
01:52:33.337 --> 01:52:37.444
He was in love with her
from the first time he saw her.

1442
01:52:37.508 --> 01:52:40.387
We all were.

1443
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:48.830
I shouldn't
a- told you this.

1444
01:52:50.754 --> 01:52:54.725
I hate death.
It scares me so.

1445
01:52:54.792 --> 01:52:57.329
Death is nothin'
to be afraid of!

1446
01:52:57.394 --> 01:53:00.466
Look at me. I'm at
the jumpin'- off place,

1447
01:53:00.531 --> 01:53:03.774
and I ain't afraid
one bit.

1448
01:53:03.834 --> 01:53:07.543
Oh, Ninny,
you're so brave.

1449
01:53:09.106 --> 01:53:13.054
Ruth and Idgie were brave,
not me.

1450
01:53:13.110 --> 01:53:16.489
I wouldn't be afraid
of death if I was you.

1451
01:53:16.547 --> 01:53:21.496
I'd be more afraid of driving
in rush-hour traffic.

1452
01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:19.704
Hi, honey.
Look what I got you.

1453
01:55:19.770 --> 01:55:21.807
Ah...

1454
01:55:21.872 --> 01:55:25.342
Ed, how sweet!

1455
01:55:25.409 --> 01:55:27.855
- Lilies! My favorite.
- Yeah.

1456
01:55:27.911 --> 01:55:31.051
I know.
Sometimes I even amaze myself.

1457
01:55:31.114 --> 01:55:35.221
- What's the occasion?
- Oh, honey, I just...

1458
01:55:35.285 --> 01:55:38.266
feel sorry about
the past few months.

1459
01:55:38.322 --> 01:55:42.327
I don't know what you're really
up to and what's going on with you,

1460
01:55:42.392 --> 01:55:46.807
but I guess I could've been more helpful
with your job and everything, you know.

1461
01:55:48.031 --> 01:55:49.908
Well, why are you...

1462
01:55:49.967 --> 01:55:52.948
puttin' up this wall
where you just tore one down?

1463
01:55:53.003 --> 01:55:56.143
Well...
I changed my mind.

1464
01:55:56.206 --> 01:55:58.982
I don't mean to seem
dense or anything,

1465
01:55:59.042 --> 01:56:03.286
- but what's changed?
- The air and the light.

1466
01:56:05.649 --> 01:56:08.255
- Ed-
- Hmm?

1467
01:56:08.318 --> 01:56:10.798
You remember how
you used to tell me...

1468
01:56:10.854 --> 01:56:13.596
you always wanted
two women in your house?

1469
01:56:13.657 --> 01:56:15.967
Oh, God.

1470
01:56:16.026 --> 01:56:17.699
Yeah.

1471
01:56:17.761 --> 01:56:19.798
Well...

1472
01:56:19.863 --> 01:56:22.810
what if I was
the younger of the two?

1473
01:56:22.866 --> 01:56:26.404
I don't believe
I get your drift.

1474
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:31.010
I want something more than I've
ever wanted anything before.

1475
01:56:31.074 --> 01:56:33.850
I want to bring
Mrs. Threadgoode...

1476
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:36.117
to our home.

1477
01:56:36.179 --> 01:56:38.819
I want her
to live here with us.

1478
01:56:38.882 --> 01:56:41.385
I want to give her the love
she's given me.

1479
01:56:41.451 --> 01:56:45.627
You're kiddin' me, aren't you?
I'm absolutely serious.

1480
01:56:45.689 --> 01:56:50.536
That's why I'm puttin' the
wall to Kyle's room back up.

1481
01:56:50.594 --> 01:56:53.666
Well, honey, this isn't
something you're just go and do.

1482
01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:56.404
I mean,
she's an old woman.

1483
01:56:56.466 --> 01:56:59.709
What if she got sick?
Who's gonna take care of her?

1484
01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:01.477
I will!

1485
01:57:01.538 --> 01:57:03.540
I can't leave her
in that place.

1486
01:57:03.607 --> 01:57:07.521
She's not a stray cat.
Hell, she isn't even family.

1487
01:57:07.577 --> 01:57:10.649
- She's family to me.
- Now, Evelyn.

1488
01:57:11.481 --> 01:57:14.553
Evelyn?

1489
01:57:14.618 --> 01:57:16.495
Honey?

1490
01:57:16.553 --> 01:57:18.555
Ah, look...

1491
01:57:18.622 --> 01:57:22.866
have you mentioned this
harebrained idea to her?

1492
01:57:22.926 --> 01:57:25.998
- Not yet.
- Well, good!

1493
01:57:26.063 --> 01:57:28.543
Then we'll just pretend
it never happened.

1494
01:57:28.598 --> 01:57:31.636
I'm making my own money.
I'll pay for everything.

1495
01:57:31.701 --> 01:57:35.274
You don't have to do
a thing.

1496
01:57:35.338 --> 01:57:37.841
Evelyn...

1497
01:57:37.908 --> 01:57:40.388
it's never
gonna happen.

1498
01:57:40.444 --> 01:57:43.118
So just forget
about it.

1499
01:57:44.714 --> 01:57:47.490
Don't you ever
say "never" to me.

1500
01:57:56.426 --> 01:57:59.236
Someone helped put a mirror
up in front of my face,

1501
01:57:59.296 --> 01:58:01.902
and I didn't like
what I saw one bit.

1502
01:58:01.965 --> 01:58:05.811
You know what I did?
I changed.

1503
01:58:05.869 --> 01:58:09.783
And that someone...
was Mrs. Threadgoode.

1504
01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:14.346
She needs my love and care,
and I'm gonna give it to her.

1505
01:58:16.113 --> 01:58:19.754
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go to the gym.

1506
01:58:24.688 --> 01:58:27.726
And if you won't listen
to reason...

1507
01:58:27.791 --> 01:58:31.432
there's always Towanda.

1508
01:58:46.209 --> 01:58:49.190
Hey, Nin-

1509
01:58:51.848 --> 01:58:54.886
What are you doing?

1510
01:58:54.951 --> 01:58:57.693
Those are her things,
Mrs. Threadgoode's things!

1511
01:58:57.754 --> 01:59:00.860
- What are you doing in here? Where's Mrs. Threadgoode?
- Who?

1512
01:59:00.924 --> 01:59:03.768
Mrs. Threadgoode! The woman
who lives here. Are you deaf?

1513
01:59:03.827 --> 01:59:06.740
I'm sorry, miss.
All they told me...

1514
01:59:06.796 --> 01:59:11.006
was that the woman who lived
in here died this morning.

1515
01:59:12.869 --> 01:59:15.008
Oh. my God!

1516
01:59:15.071 --> 01:59:19.417
Wha- What
are you sayin'?

1517
01:59:19.476 --> 01:59:21.649
She died early
this morning.

1518
01:59:21.711 --> 01:59:26.057
They were shorthanded so they asked
me to take all this stuff down.

1519
01:59:26.116 --> 01:59:28.619
That? all I know.

1520
01:59:48.004 --> 01:59:49.950
Stop that!

1521
01:59:50.006 --> 01:59:52.384
What is the matter
with you people?

1522
01:59:52.442 --> 01:59:55.389
Can't you wait a goddamn day,
for Chrissake?

1523
01:59:55.445 --> 01:59:58.449
Do you have no respect?
These are her things!

1524
01:59:58.515 --> 02:00:02.691
I'm sorry, but they told me to get
this room ready for another patient.

1525
02:00:02.752 --> 02:00:05.961
She may be just
another patient to you,

1526
02:00:06.022 --> 02:00:10.129
- but she was my friend, and I loved her.
- I'm sorry.

1527
02:00:10.193 --> 02:00:12.139
I'm just
following orders.

1528
02:00:12.195 --> 02:00:15.142
- What is going on?
- Why didn't you call me?

1529
02:00:15.198 --> 02:00:18.543
- You could've called me before
you sent that idiot- - I'm sorry.

1530
02:00:18.602 --> 02:00:21.276
It never occurred to me that
you would take it this hard.

1531
02:00:21.338 --> 02:00:24.979
- I didn't even get to tell
her good-bye. - Oh, I know.

1532
02:00:25.041 --> 02:00:29.012
These things are difficult, but
she died peacefully in her sleep.

1533
02:00:29.079 --> 02:00:32.356
To tell you the truth, I thought
you'd be happy for Mrs. Threadgoode.

1534
02:00:32.415 --> 02:00:35.453
- Happy?
- Why, yes! This is what she wanted.

1535
02:00:35.518 --> 02:00:37.464
What?
To be dead?

1536
02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.057
No, to go home.
You just missed her.

1537
02:00:40.123 --> 02:00:42.569
She left in a yellow cab
about a half hour ago.

1538
02:00:42.626 --> 02:00:45.334
I don't understand.
What? A cab?

1539
02:00:45.395 --> 02:00:49.673
She said there wasn't no reason for
her to stay now that Mrs. Otis had died.

1540
02:00:49.733 --> 02:00:52.373
Mrs...

1541
02:00:52.435 --> 02:00:54.608
Otis is dead?

1542
02:00:54.671 --> 02:00:58.551
Oh, Mrs. Otis died.

1543
02:00:58.608 --> 02:01:00.610
Mrs. Otis died!

1544
02:01:00.677 --> 02:01:03.886
Mrs. Otis!
Oh, God!

1545
02:01:03.947 --> 02:01:07.986
Not that... I'm glad that
Mrs. Otis died, it's just-

1546
02:01:08.051 --> 02:01:10.691
Oh, God.
I've gotta stop her.

1547
02:01:50.126 --> 02:01:53.369
Hey, Evelyn,
somebody stole my house.

1548
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:56.343
It was right here
when I left.

1549
02:01:56.399 --> 02:02:01.178
Unless
- Oh, Evelyn, you don't reckon I'm crazy, do you?

1550
02:02:01.237 --> 02:02:05.447
- It was here when I left.
- No, honey, you're not crazy.

1551
02:02:05.508 --> 02:02:08.284
This is the place.

1552
02:02:08.345 --> 02:02:12.384
Why would anyone want to
steal an old lady's home?

1553
02:02:12.449 --> 02:02:14.588
Wasn't worth nothin'.

1554
02:02:14.651 --> 02:02:18.064
Oh, honey,
nobody stole it.

1555
02:02:18.121 --> 02:02:22.001
They had to tear it down.
It was condemned.

1556
02:02:22.058 --> 02:02:24.197
I'm sorry.
I shoulda told you.

1557
02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:27.537
Well, somebody
shoulda told me.

1558
02:02:27.597 --> 02:02:32.444
- I'm old. I'm not a child.
- I'm sorry.

1559
02:02:32.502 --> 02:02:35.847
My husband Cleo and I
lived in this house...

1560
02:02:35.905 --> 02:02:38.408
for more than 40 years.

1561
02:02:38.475 --> 02:02:41.888
Now, it's... it's gone.

1562
02:02:41.945 --> 02:02:45.518
83 years worth of livin'
and all that's left of me...

1563
02:02:45.582 --> 02:02:49.621
is what's in this box, a
bunch of old cards and pictures.

1564
02:02:49.686 --> 02:02:52.166
Come on.
I'll take you home.

1565
02:02:52.222 --> 02:02:54.361
This is my home!

1566
02:02:54.424 --> 02:02:56.426
And now it's gone.

1567
02:02:56.493 --> 02:02:59.030
And Mrs. Otis
is gone.

1568
02:02:59.095 --> 02:03:01.200
I...

1569
02:03:01.264 --> 02:03:03.870
I don't quite
know what to do.

1570
02:03:03.933 --> 02:03:07.779
This is the first time I can remember
when I don't have a soul to look after.

1571
02:03:07.837 --> 02:03:10.215
You can come
look after me and Ed.

1572
02:03:10.273 --> 02:03:12.583
Oh, you're sweet,

1573
02:03:12.642 --> 02:03:15.452
but I think you're doin'
just fine on your own.

1574
02:03:15.512 --> 02:03:19.824
Don't you know you'd be
like a gift for us?

1575
02:03:19.883 --> 02:03:23.057
You're the reason
I get up every morning...

1576
02:03:23.119 --> 02:03:26.464
and that Mary Kay's
havin' such a good year...

1577
02:03:26.523 --> 02:03:31.097
and I don't look like some
blob from a horror movie.

1578
02:03:31.161 --> 02:03:35.200
Well,with a little help
from Idgie and Ruth.

1579
02:03:36.766 --> 02:03:39.303
Come on. I've got
your room all ready.

1580
02:03:39.369 --> 02:03:41.781
What does Ed say
about all this?

1581
02:03:41.838 --> 02:03:45.684
He'll learn
to love it.

1582
02:03:49.145 --> 02:03:53.287
Did I ever tell you that Mrs.
Otis was Sipsey's baby sister?

1583
02:03:53.349 --> 02:03:56.023
- No, ma'am.
- Yes, she was.

1584
02:03:56.085 --> 02:03:59.965
Mrs. Otis was with Sipsey
and me the night Sipsey died.

1585
02:04:00.023 --> 02:04:05.200
Sipsey told me a story that night
I've never told a living soul, Evelyn.

1586
02:04:05.261 --> 02:04:08.401
A story about
what really happened...

1587
02:04:08.465 --> 02:04:11.810
The night Frank Bennett
disappeared

1588
02:04:44.367 --> 02:04:47.905
- Hey there!
- You got to come quick.

1589
02:04:47.971 --> 02:04:52.943
- The show has hardly begun.
- You got to come quick. You hear me?

1590
02:04:58.848 --> 02:05:01.454
- Run, get help! Run, quick!
- Where's the baby?

1591
02:05:01.518 --> 02:05:03.327
Never mind.

1592
02:05:22.038 --> 02:05:23.711
Excuse me, sir.

1593
02:05:23.773 --> 02:05:29.280
I don't believe you should be
goin' anywhere with Ruth's baby.

1594
02:05:40.924 --> 02:05:43.666
Like I said,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

1595
02:05:43.726 --> 02:05:46.297
Damn, you a thickheaded
son-of-a-bitch, ain't you?

1596
02:05:50.500 --> 02:05:52.480
I told you...

1597
02:05:52.535 --> 02:05:56.984
you ain't goin' nowheres
with Miss Ruth's baby.

1598
02:06:02.612 --> 02:06:04.819
Come on, angel.
Come on.

1599
02:06:04.881 --> 02:06:08.727
Come on, sweetheart.
It's all right.

1600
02:06:08.785 --> 02:06:11.288
Come on.
It's all right, baby.

1601
02:06:14.190 --> 02:06:16.932
it was self-defense.

1602
02:06:16.993 --> 02:06:21.840
I don't know why any white
jury would care why I did it.

1603
02:06:21.898 --> 02:06:24.708
- Well, I saw it, and I can testify.
- Excuse me here.

1604
02:06:24.767 --> 02:06:26.940
I don't mean
no offense here,

1605
02:06:27.003 --> 02:06:30.075
but I don't know who's less
likely to convince a jury,

1606
02:06:30.139 --> 02:06:32.415
my mama...
or Mr. Smokey.

1607
02:06:32.475 --> 02:06:35.285
No offense taken.

1608
02:06:35.345 --> 02:06:37.757
You're a good man,
Mr. Smokey.

1609
02:06:37.814 --> 02:06:41.853
- You did good.
- The sun's almost up.

1610
02:06:45.388 --> 02:06:48.767
- George?
- Mm-hmm?

1611
02:06:48.825 --> 02:06:51.601
I think...

1612
02:06:51.661 --> 02:06:55.199
it's hog-boiling time.

1613
02:06:55.264 --> 02:06:57.540
No, ma'am. It
ain't cold enough.

1614
02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:00.376
It's hog-boiling time.

1615
02:07:03.306 --> 02:07:05.252
Big George?

1616
02:07:05.308 --> 02:07:08.414
- Uh-huh? - When is that
barbecue gonna be ready?

1617
02:07:08.478 --> 02:07:10.822
It's gonna be ready
any time now.

1618
02:07:10.880 --> 02:07:15.795
Smells so damn good I just
can't wait to get me some.

1619
02:07:15.852 --> 02:07:20.164
- Now, don't you forget to call me when that's ready.
- All right.

1620
02:07:33.903 --> 02:07:36.179
Here you go.

1621
02:07:37.740 --> 02:07:41.381
- Miss Idgie? Smokey left town.
- Yeah?

1622
02:07:41.444 --> 02:07:45.449
I thought it'd be best
under the circumstances.

1623
02:07:45.515 --> 02:07:49.486
He asked that
you tell Ruth good-bye.

1624
02:07:49.552 --> 02:07:52.032
Shame he had to go.

1625
02:07:58.995 --> 02:08:03.910
Hold on! I'm comin'.

1626
02:08:08.771 --> 02:08:11.547
- What you want?
- We want some barbecue.

1627
02:08:11.607 --> 02:08:15.316
Not today you don't.
Go on.

1628
02:08:28.357 --> 02:08:31.497
Why, this is about the
best barbecue I ever ate!

1629
02:08:32.995 --> 02:08:36.499
The secret's
in the sauce.

1630
02:08:45.274 --> 02:08:49.154
Sipsey?
My God!

1631
02:08:49.212 --> 02:08:53.558
That fryin' pan did more
than fry chicken that night.

1632
02:08:55.318 --> 02:08:59.789
Did Idgie really barbecue Frank
Bennett? Are you pullin' my leg?

1633
02:08:59.856 --> 02:09:03.565
Secret's in the sauce,
or so I've been told.

1634
02:09:07.063 --> 02:09:10.909
Now you know why
Idgie had to go on trial.

1635
02:09:10.967 --> 02:09:14.608
She knew the law would never
believe Sipsey. No!

1636
02:09:14.670 --> 02:09:17.173
Sipsey or Big George
or anyone else of color...

1637
02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:20.710
would've been hangin'
from the nearest tree.

1638
02:09:20.777 --> 02:09:23.053
To this day,
I'm still not sure...

1639
02:09:23.112 --> 02:09:25.683
whether Ruth
ever believed...

1640
02:09:25.748 --> 02:09:29.890
that Idgie didn't kill
Frank Bennett.

1641
02:09:29.952 --> 02:09:34.196
Truth's a funny thing
sometimes.

1642
02:09:34.257 --> 02:09:38.228
- I feel better now.
- Good.

1643
02:09:38.294 --> 02:09:41.605
I feel better 'cause
all these people'll live...

1644
02:09:41.664 --> 02:09:44.736
as long as
you remember 'em.

1645
02:09:44.801 --> 02:09:46.747
You reminded me...

1646
02:09:46.803 --> 02:09:50.216
about what the most
important thing in life is.

1647
02:09:50.273 --> 02:09:52.617
- Do you know what I think it is?
- No, ma'am.

1648
02:09:52.675 --> 02:09:55.952
Friends.
Best friends.

1649
02:09:56.012 --> 02:09:59.050
Oh. Ninny!

1650
02:10:00.216 --> 02:10:01.957
Look.

1651
02:10:07.223 --> 02:10:09.066
Oh!

1652
02:10:28.277 --> 02:10:30.223
Idgie?

1653
02:10:33.683 --> 02:10:37.563
- Idgie's alive?
- Oh, yes!

1654
02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:41.898
She's still out and about
Charmin' bees and selling honey.

1655
02:10:41.958 --> 02:10:45.929
Sometimes I think
I catch a glimpse of her.

1656
02:10:51.834 --> 02:10:54.280
Maybe we'll
see her today.

1657
02:10:54.337 --> 02:10:56.977
Maybe.

1658
02:10:58.641 --> 02:11:01.349
Let's go.

1659
02:11:12.855 --> 02:11:17.167
After Ruth died and
the railroad stopped runnin',

1660
02:11:17.226 --> 02:11:21.231
the cafe shut down, and everybody
just scattered to the winds.

1661
02:11:22.565 --> 02:11:25.944
It was never more than just
a little knockabout place.

1662
02:11:26.002 --> 02:11:28.812
But now that
I look back on it,

1663
02:11:28.871 --> 02:11:31.147
when that cafe closed...

1664
02:11:31.207 --> 02:11:35.314
the heart of the town
just stopped beating.

1665
02:11:35.378 --> 02:11:38.222
It's funny how
a little place like this...

1666
02:11:38.281 --> 02:11:42.127
brought so many people together.
