1
00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:41.957
Let's keep those hammers working!

2
00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:06.749
Let's go.

3
00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:31.291
How are you, Johnny?

4
00:01:32.082 --> 00:01:33.082
Good.

5
00:01:35.207 --> 00:01:36.582
That's all.

6
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.957
I'm sorry they sent you
to such a hellhole.

7
00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:44.582
I've seen worse.

8
00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:46.749
Yeah, you have, haven't you

9
00:01:48.082 --> 00:01:52.207
I told you that I'd help you
when I could. Are you interested?

10
00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.999
You can't possibly want
to stay here for another five years.

11
00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.291
In here at least I know where I stand.
- Just hear me out first.

12
00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:15.416
A covert operation
is being geared up in the Far East.

13
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:20.749
A computer gave your name as one of
3 suitable candidates for the mission.

14
00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:25.249
Mission?
- A hunt for POWs in Vietnam.

15
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:32.207
Why now? Why me?

16
00:02:34.624 --> 00:02:37.624
The prison camp you escaped from in 71
is the target area.

17
00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:42.207
No one knows that terrain better
than you. The risk factor's very high.

18
00:02:42.332 --> 00:02:46.166
You'd be temporarily reinstated in the
forces, and if the mission's successful,

19
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.124
there may be a presidential pardon.

20
00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:52.541
You interested?

21
00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:00.749
Yeah.

22
00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:05.291
Good. I'll get the necessary clearance.

23
00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:10.874
The next time we meet will be in
Thailand with the special ops designate.

24
00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:12.457
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:14.499
All clear?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:17.291
I want you to know I did
what I could to keep you out of here.

27
00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:19.416
I know.

28
00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:26.999
Do we get to win this time?

29
00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.166
This time's up to you.

30
00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:45.749
That'll be all.

31
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:51.707
How're you doing, Rambo? I'm Ericson.
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

32
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:56.707
You're the chosen one, ha?

33
00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:01.041
You made
a helluva rep for yourself in 'nam.

34
00:06:01.124 --> 00:06:03.457
I'm glad to be working with you.

35
00:06:03.874 --> 00:06:07.582
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint.

36
00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:13.999
He's here.

37
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.999
Morning, John.

38
00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:22.624
This is Marshal Murdock.
He's in charge of special operations.

39
00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:24.957
Thank you, Colonel. Rambo,

40
00:06:25.082 --> 00:06:28.332
been looking forward to meeting you.
How was your trip? No problems?

41
00:06:28.457 --> 00:06:31.707
Except for the damned heat, right?
I've never felt anything like it.

42
00:06:32.124 --> 00:06:34.416
Come on in,
let's get down to business.

43
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:39.749
I was glancing over your files.

44
00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:43.041
Makes pretty interesting reading.

45
00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:53.624
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent.

46
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:57.291
That's a helluva combination.
Joined the army 6.8.64,

47
00:06:57.957 --> 00:07:00.624
accepted special forces,
specialization: light weapons.

48
00:07:01.624 --> 00:07:03.905
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

49
00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:09.041
59 confirmed kills, <i>2</i> silver stars,
4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

50
00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:10.707
Medal of Honor.

51
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:17.749
You got around, didn't you?
Incredible. Rambo, you're probably aware

52
00:07:17.874 --> 00:07:21.666
that there are almost 2,500 Americans
still missing in action in SE Asia.

53
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:26.582
Most are presumed dead, but for the
families, Congress and many Americans

54
00:07:26.707 --> 00:07:29.166
it's still an emotional issue.

55
00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:31.031
Give me something cold, please!

56
00:07:31.957 --> 00:07:36.541
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

57
00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:40.082
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Turn in '66.

58
00:07:40.207 --> 00:07:44.041
I lost a lot of good men,
so I know what you and every vet feels.

59
00:07:44.166 --> 00:07:48.499
Maybe the government and certain
segments of the population didn't care,

60
00:07:49.624 --> 00:07:50.624
but my committee cares.

61
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:54.582
It needs proof
that Americans are there.

62
00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.291
Then we'll get 'em back.

63
00:07:56.707 --> 00:08:01.874
If there are any of our men at the POW
target camp, you're to take photos.

64
00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.749
Photos?
- Only photos. Under no circumstances

65
00:08:06.874 --> 00:08:11.541
are you to engage the enemy.
- I'm supposed to leave them there?

66
00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:14.457
I repeat:
do not engage the enemy!

67
00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:18.791
The assault team led by Colonel Trautman
will handle the extraction.

68
00:08:25.332 --> 00:08:30.374
With your participation,
this mission has a better than average

69
00:08:30.499 --> 00:08:32.207
chance of succeeding.

70
00:08:33.957 --> 00:08:37.874
I'll meet you both
in the operations center in one hour.

71
00:08:54.999 --> 00:08:58.332
From Thailand across Laos
into the mountains of Vietnam.

72
00:08:58.749 --> 00:09:01.999
You'll be flying a ceiling
of 250 feet when you bail out.

73
00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:05.166
Think you can handle it?
- I'll try.

74
00:09:05.624 --> 00:09:09.874
Since you're going in solo, you'll have
to take more equipment than ever before.

75
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:14.082
And use it!
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.

76
00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:17.166
Let technology do most of the work.

77
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:22.541
Forget the war. Remember the mission.
The old Vietnam is dead.

78
00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:27.124
Sir, I'm alive,
so it's still alive, isn't it?

79
00:09:37.624 --> 00:09:40.499
You may find this hard
to believe, but all this is for you.

80
00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:42.416
Impressed?

81
00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:47.791
You'll get every modern piece
of equipment we have

82
00:09:47.874 --> 00:09:49.624
to ensure your safety.

83
00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:53.291
You can feel totally safe because we
have the world's most advanced weapons.

84
00:09:55.999 --> 00:09:58.166
I've always believed that the mind's
the best weapon.

85
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:00.041
Times change.

86
00:10:00.624 --> 00:10:01.707
For some people.

87
00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:04.624
Don't let me interrupt.

88
00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:08.041
Upon insertion
call into base camp on Transat.

89
00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:11.874
Then proceed to rendezvous
with your ground contact,

90
00:10:11.957 --> 00:10:14.082
indigenous agent Co Bao.

91
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:16.166
Is he listening?

92
00:10:16.624 --> 00:10:19.291
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

93
00:10:26.707 --> 00:10:28.041
Colonel!

94
00:10:29.207 --> 00:10:31.666
Are you sure he's not unbalanced?

95
00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:35.416
What if he cracks under the pressure
in that he"?

96
00:10:35.499 --> 00:10:36.499
Pressure?

97
00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:40.124
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen.

98
00:10:40.707 --> 00:10:44.957
A pure fighting machine with only
a desire to win a war someone else lost.

99
00:10:45.082 --> 00:10:50.416
If winning means he has to die,
he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

100
00:10:51.874 --> 00:10:53.874
And one more thing:

101
00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:57.916
What you call “hell", he calls home.

102
00:11:01.749 --> 00:11:03.832
Stand by! Start A.P.U.!

103
00:11:27.957 --> 00:11:29.749
D minus 20.

104
00:12:01.749 --> 00:12:03.124
D minus 5.

105
00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:24.374
You've got 36 hours to get in and out.
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

106
00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:31.291
If you run into trouble, try to get
to the hilltop extraction site.

107
00:12:37.041 --> 00:12:38.749
Good luck, son.
- Thanks.

108
00:12:39.166 --> 00:12:40.749
Ready to roll.

109
00:12:43.332 --> 00:12:47.541
Murdock said he'd been
with the 2nd Battalion in Kon Tum '66.

110
00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:51.291
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

111
00:12:53.416 --> 00:12:55.082
You're the only one that I trust.

112
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:41.582
Think he'll find someone?
- POWs? Doubtful.

113
00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:46.291
But there are people to satisfy,
questions that have to be answered.

114
00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:50.082
You don't sound too emotional about it.
- It wasn't my war, Colonel.

115
00:13:50.499 --> 00:13:52.999
I'm here to clean up the mess.

116
00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:38.332
K-Wok 2-5 is raft.

117
00:14:38.457 --> 00:14:40.582
They're holding timeline.

118
00:14:40.666 --> 00:14:43.082
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

119
00:15:17.332 --> 00:15:19.291
We're back in the badlands, my man.

120
00:15:20.624 --> 00:15:22.124
Stand by your position!

121
00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:25.957
Insertion in 15 seconds.
- Partytime!

122
00:15:38.999 --> 00:15:40.832
<i>5</i> seconds.

123
00:15:58.624 --> 00:16:01.041
What's happening?
- He's hung up!

124
00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:05.624
He'll be torn apart!

125
00:16:07.416 --> 00:16:09.749
He's hung up!
- What do you mean he's hung up?

126
00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:11.582
He's being dragged!

127
00:16:13.832 --> 00:16:15.791
Cut him loose!
- I can't free him!

128
00:16:37.374 --> 00:16:40.541
Abort the mission!
- That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

129
00:16:44.624 --> 00:16:45.916
He's cutting away his equipment.

130
00:16:57.582 --> 00:16:59.541
He's out!

131
00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:04.207
Here is Dragonfly 1. Do you read me?
- Dragonfly 1, I read you.

132
00:17:04.332 --> 00:17:07.874
Any visual bearing by flares?
- Negative. We didn't see anything.

133
00:17:15.999 --> 00:17:20.249
Maybe it's best to abort
the mission now.

134
00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:22.332
Who could survive that?

135
00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:24.124
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

136
00:17:24.541 --> 00:17:29.124
He's got 36 hours to complete the
mission and reach the extraction point.

137
00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:32.499
We owe him that.
- Of course we do.

138
00:17:33.374 --> 00:17:38.124
But understand something:
In 36 hours we pull out.

139
00:19:37.624 --> 00:19:39.832
You did not expect a woman, no?

140
00:19:42.374 --> 00:19:43.832
We'd better go.

141
00:19:46.832 --> 00:19:51.291
We go to river.
How come you so late?

142
00:19:51.707 --> 00:19:53.291
I was hung up.

143
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:03.291
I have arranged boat to take us
down river. Old ways not safe.

144
00:20:03.874 --> 00:20:07.499
You come a long way, Rambo,
to see empty camp.

145
00:21:00.624 --> 00:21:02.166
You're using pirates?

146
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:06.416
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

147
00:22:27.457 --> 00:22:29.791
What about patrol boats?

148
00:23:19.832 --> 00:23:20.832
Rambo,

149
00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:23.999
want to eat?

150
00:23:25.582 --> 00:23:27.624
Maybe later.

151
00:23:36.332 --> 00:23:37.874
How you get into this?

152
00:23:40.374 --> 00:23:43.999
It's a long story.
- Long trip.

153
00:23:46.957 --> 00:23:50.207
After I left the special forces,

154
00:23:50.624 --> 00:23:55.124
I moved around a lot.
- Why you leave army?

155
00:23:55.582 --> 00:23:56.624
I, uh...

156
00:23:58.291 --> 00:24:01.082
came back to the States

157
00:24:01.166 --> 00:24:03.207
and found another war going on.

158
00:24:07.749 --> 00:24:09.416
Kind of like a quiet war.

159
00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:16.041
A war against the soldiers returning.

160
00:24:16.124 --> 00:24:17.374
The kind of war you don't win.

161
00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:26.499
It's my problem.
How did you get into it?

162
00:24:28.332 --> 00:24:32.374
My father
worked for intelligence agency.

163
00:24:33.416 --> 00:24:36.457
He killed, and I take his place.

164
00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:38.874
There's too much death here.

165
00:24:40.082 --> 00:24:41.082
Death everywhere.

166
00:24:45.457 --> 00:24:46.791
I just want to live.

167
00:24:50.749 --> 00:24:54.791
Maybe go America. Live the quiet life.

168
00:24:58.457 --> 00:25:00.416
What you want?

169
00:25:02.541 --> 00:25:05.082
To win. To survive.

170
00:25:07.207 --> 00:25:10.749
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

171
00:25:11.374 --> 00:25:15.332
To survive a war,
you've got to become war.

172
00:25:15.457 --> 00:25:18.874
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

173
00:25:24.082 --> 00:25:26.041
I am expendable.

174
00:25:28.749 --> 00:25:30.332
What mean “expendable“?

175
00:25:34.374 --> 00:25:39.457
Someone invites you to a party
and you don't show up,

176
00:25:40.749 --> 00:25:42.791
and it doesn't really matter.

177
00:25:52.457 --> 00:25:53.499
It bring me good luck.

178
00:25:56.207 --> 00:25:58.624
What bring you good luck?

179
00:26:06.124 --> 00:26:08.166
I guess this.

180
00:26:14.791 --> 00:26:16.374
No further reports.

181
00:26:16.457 --> 00:26:18.377
I want to go up
with the extraction team at dawn.

182
00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.707
Denied.
- Denied?

183
00:26:20.832 --> 00:26:23.874
It's an unnecessary risk.
- We have a schedule to keep.

184
00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:26.749
We don't even know if he's alive.
- Unlikely.

185
00:26:26.874 --> 00:26:29.166
You said we'd go through as planned.

186
00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:35.416
Okay, if you
want to go through with it, we will.

187
00:26:35.541 --> 00:26:37.541
The Colonel's
gonna be joining the extraction team.

188
00:26:40.541 --> 00:26:42.374
You're a damned good man, Trautman.

189
00:27:39.874 --> 00:27:42.166
See? Camp empty.

190
00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:45.499
We move closer.

191
00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:32.207
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

192
00:28:36.832 --> 00:28:38.041
Come on!

193
00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:56.916
What is it?
- A bow. No sound.

194
00:29:03.957 --> 00:29:08.499
You not going in there.
You're supposed to only take pictures.

195
00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:12.416
No more orders, Co.

196
00:32:55.916 --> 00:32:57.374
I've come to get you out.

197
00:33:29.291 --> 00:33:32.666
There are others.
- I'll be back.

198
00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:13.166
Everything okay?

199
00:35:14.082 --> 00:35:15.666
Let's go!

200
00:35:48.957 --> 00:35:50.749
You have clearance.

201
00:35:51.166 --> 00:35:53.291
Minus one hour to extraction.

202
00:35:53.707 --> 00:35:56.791
I hope for his sake
we're not just wasting fuel.

203
00:35:57.207 --> 00:35:59.291
Let's get moving.

204
00:36:21.957 --> 00:36:23.582
A good thing you came when you did.

205
00:36:23.707 --> 00:36:24.999
Why is that?

206
00:36:25.832 --> 00:36:29.416
They move us around a lot. Because
of the crops. Only been there a week.

207
00:36:30.416 --> 00:36:35.332
When were you last in that camp?
- A year. What year is it, anyway?

208
00:36:42.041 --> 00:36:44.041
Camp supposed to be empty.

209
00:36:44.957 --> 00:36:46.332
Yes, supposed to be.

210
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:22.249
Landing zone a mile up river.

211
00:38:23.332 --> 00:38:25.916
What has happened?
- We've been sold out.

212
00:39:04.957 --> 00:39:07.791
Right, jump!
- I fight!

213
00:39:08.416 --> 00:39:09.582
Jump! Go on!

214
00:40:05.291 --> 00:40:06.749
The gunboat!

215
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:25.957
Jump!

216
00:40:38.457 --> 00:40:40.041
You made it, Rambo!

217
00:40:48.457 --> 00:40:49.666
Come on.

218
00:41:15.124 --> 00:41:16.707
Take this. We go on from here.

219
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:20.541
Better I stay on to end.
- This is the end.

220
00:41:22.124 --> 00:41:23.124
Come on.

221
00:41:27.499 --> 00:41:29.124
You not expendable.

222
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:54.707
Colonel, 3 minutes.

223
00:43:15.457 --> 00:43:16.499
Christ, he's found one!

224
00:43:46.957 --> 00:43:49.124
Rambo's found one of ours!

225
00:43:50.291 --> 00:43:54.957
The ground crew has what appears to be
an American POW with him.

226
00:43:56.124 --> 00:43:59.249
What did you say?
- They've got one of ours.

227
00:44:00.499 --> 00:44:03.291
Yellow alert!
Meyers, Harrison, Goddell!

228
00:44:03.416 --> 00:44:06.666
Everybody out! Move!

229
00:44:07.082 --> 00:44:09.207
Go to your COMINT frequency!
Give me the mike!

230
00:44:12.207 --> 00:44:16.249
Dragonfly, here is Coach 1.
This is a priority order.

231
00:44:18.082 --> 00:44:19.624
Come on!

232
00:44:22.957 --> 00:44:26.332
Abort the operation immediately!

233
00:44:26.457 --> 00:44:29.916
This is a recall. Confirm. Over.
- Say it again, Coach 1.

234
00:44:30.499 --> 00:44:31.957
Abort the operation!

235
00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:37.624
I've been ordered to abort.
- But we've got them in sight!

236
00:44:37.749 --> 00:44:39.332
Murdock, do you read?

237
00:44:43.374 --> 00:44:46.207
We're going down.
- You're not going anywhere.

238
00:44:49.749 --> 00:44:53.582
You damned mercenaries!
Those are our men down there!

239
00:44:54.957 --> 00:44:57.916
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

240
00:45:05.124 --> 00:45:06.291
Colonel!

241
00:45:49.207 --> 00:45:52.374
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?

242
00:45:52.916 --> 00:45:55.291
Don't act so innocent, Colonel.

243
00:45:55.666 --> 00:45:58.374
You had your suspicions,
which makes you a sort of accessory.

244
00:45:58.791 --> 00:46:01.541
Don't ever
count me with you and your scum!

245
00:46:01.957 --> 00:46:06.207
It was a lie, wasn't it.
Like the whole damned war. It was a lie.

246
00:46:06.624 --> 00:46:08.291
What are you talking about?

247
00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:11.374
That camp was supposed to be empty.

248
00:46:12.374 --> 00:46:16.999
Rambo goes in, finds no POWs,
Congress buys it, case closed.

249
00:46:17.416 --> 00:46:22.791
And if he happens to get caught,
nobody knows except you.

250
00:46:23.207 --> 00:46:25.874
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

251
00:46:26.291 --> 00:46:29.041
A stinking bureaucrat
who's trying to cover his ass.

252
00:46:29.124 --> 00:46:32.707
Not just mine. A nation's!

253
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:37.707
Besides, it was your hero's fault. If
he had done what he was meant to do,

254
00:46:37.791 --> 00:46:42.666
we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.

255
00:46:42.749 --> 00:46:46.957
And if those pictures showed something,
they'd have been lost.

256
00:46:47.332 --> 00:46:50.374
You still don't understand
what this is all about.

257
00:46:50.457 --> 00:46:53.249
Same as always: Money.

258
00:46:53.332 --> 00:46:56.916
In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in war reparation.

259
00:46:56.999 --> 00:46:59.916
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

260
00:46:59.999 --> 00:47:03.207
And you're doing the same thing
allover again.

261
00:47:03.291 --> 00:47:04.957
What would you do?

262
00:47:05.082 --> 00:47:10.332
Pay ransom for our men and finance
the war effort against our allies?

263
00:47:10.416 --> 00:47:13.374
And if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

264
00:47:13.457 --> 00:47:18.499
Do you want to start the war over again
and bomb Hanoi?

265
00:47:18.624 --> 00:47:21.791
You think the Senate's

266
00:47:21.874 --> 00:47:24.916
going to pay billions
for a few forgotten ghosts?

267
00:47:25.041 --> 00:47:27.624
For men!
Men who fought for their country!

268
00:47:27.707 --> 00:47:28.749
That's enough!

269
00:47:30.332 --> 00:47:34.916
Trautman, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place.

270
00:47:36.874 --> 00:47:39.624
You bastard!
- And if I were you,

271
00:47:40.124 --> 00:47:43.249
I'd not make the mistake
of bringing it up again.

272
00:47:43.332 --> 00:47:44.874
You're making the mistake.

273
00:49:16.332 --> 00:49:17.999
He's dead now.

274
00:49:28.166 --> 00:49:29.957
Bring him up!

275
00:49:51.374 --> 00:49:54.166
These people
are so vulgar in their methods!

276
00:49:55.124 --> 00:49:57.749
They lack compassion.

277
00:50:00.374 --> 00:50:03.666
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

278
00:50:05.457 --> 00:50:07.666
I do not know who you are yet,

279
00:50:08.291 --> 00:50:09.957
but I will.

280
00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:11.957
Take him and clean him up.

281
00:50:46.874 --> 00:50:48.416
That's all.

282
00:50:48.791 --> 00:50:52.707
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

283
00:50:57.374 --> 00:51:00.666
I see you are no stranger to pain.

284
00:51:01.082 --> 00:51:04.457
Perhaps you have been
among my Vietnamese comrades before?

285
00:51:07.624 --> 00:51:08.666
No answer?

286
00:51:09.999 --> 00:51:12.249
Do you wish to give your name?

287
00:51:12.874 --> 00:51:15.999
What possible harm can that cause?

288
00:51:19.207 --> 00:51:21.791
Pride is a poor substitute
for intelligence.

289
00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:25.999
What you must understand
is that we must interrogate you.

290
00:51:28.832 --> 00:51:33.082
For Sergeant Yushin you're a piece
of meat, a laboratory experiment.

291
00:51:33.207 --> 00:51:36.624
But for me you are a comrade,
similar to myself,

292
00:51:37.291 --> 00:51:40.499
just opposed by an act of fate.

293
00:51:42.291 --> 00:51:44.541
I know you were trying

294
00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:49.041
to facilitate the release
of war criminals. I can appreciate this.

295
00:51:50.291 --> 00:51:54.166
But this incident, your capture, is

296
00:51:56.332 --> 00:51:57.374
embarrassing.

297
00:51:58.166 --> 00:51:59.874
We must have an explanation.

298
00:52:00.624 --> 00:52:03.666
I want you to radio your HQ

299
00:52:03.749 --> 00:52:06.749
and say that
you have been captured and condemned

300
00:52:06.874 --> 00:52:09.207
for espionage,

301
00:52:09.291 --> 00:52:13.541
and that attempts like these
should not be made in the future,

302
00:52:14.124 --> 00:52:18.291
or they
will meet with the same fate as you.

303
00:52:27.749 --> 00:52:29.124
Fuck you!

304
00:52:32.041 --> 00:52:35.457
You wish to test your strength good.

305
00:53:41.541 --> 00:53:43.124
Comrade, here is something

306
00:53:44.374 --> 00:53:46.957
that might be of interest to you:

307
00:53:47.374 --> 00:53:51.374
a transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

308
00:53:51.499 --> 00:53:54.832
and his commander that we intercepted.

309
00:53:56.416 --> 00:54:00.832
“Dragonfly" and “Wolf's Den“
Colorful names.

310
00:54:01.707 --> 00:54:02.832
Here we are:

311
00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:05.666
“We have them in sight“.

312
00:54:05.749 --> 00:54:10.124
And the reply:
“Abort the operation immediately.“

313
00:54:11.707 --> 00:54:15.916
“This is a recall. Confirm. Over.“

314
00:54:17.207 --> 00:54:20.957
It seems you were abandoned
by direct command.

315
00:54:22.207 --> 00:54:26.291
And these are the people
you protect with your pain!

316
00:54:26.374 --> 00:54:28.541
Increase the voltage.

317
00:54:30.249 --> 00:54:33.874
You may scream. There is no shame.

318
00:55:04.832 --> 00:55:07.749
You are strong! Very strong!

319
00:55:07.874 --> 00:55:09.666
The strongest so far.

320
00:55:10.624 --> 00:55:13.832
But you're nearly dead. Poor waif.

321
00:55:42.457 --> 00:55:45.749
To talk, to obey
would be so much easier.

322
00:56:00.457 --> 00:56:03.541
Yushin
has a memento for you of this day.

323
00:56:25.541 --> 00:56:27.749
Put it in his eye.

324
00:56:34.624 --> 00:56:39.124
If your own life
means nothing to you, perhaps his does.

325
00:56:39.249 --> 00:56:42.916
Don't tell them anything!
- You will talk.

326
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:54.291
Yes?

327
00:57:29.749 --> 00:57:31.207
Don't do it!

328
00:57:33.582 --> 00:57:35.249
Do it

329
00:58:05.707 --> 00:58:08.832
Two-two-zero-five-six

330
00:58:09.666 --> 00:58:11.749
Lone Wolf receive.

331
00:58:13.332 --> 00:58:15.791
This is Lone Wolf

332
00:58:16.791 --> 00:58:21.041
Lone Wolf, this is Wolf's Den.
Transmit location and status.

333
00:58:21.457 --> 00:58:24.541
What is it?
- It's Rambo, Sir.

334
00:58:25.624 --> 00:58:28.499
We read you,
Lone Wolf. What is your position? Over.

335
00:58:30.291 --> 00:58:32.957
I say again:
What is your position? Over.

336
00:58:34.624 --> 00:58:38.249
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

337
00:58:40.124 --> 00:58:42.207
This is Trautman. Where are you?

338
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:48.374
Come in!

339
00:58:57.416 --> 00:58:58.416
Murdock.

340
00:58:59.999 --> 00:59:01.624
He's here.

341
00:59:05.957 --> 00:59:08.207
Rambo, we're glad you're alive.

342
00:59:09.166 --> 00:59:13.332
Where are you? Give us your position,
and we'll come to pick you up.

343
00:59:22.207 --> 00:59:23.332
Murdock.

344
00:59:26.832 --> 00:59:28.582
I'm coming to get you!

345
01:02:57.416 --> 01:02:58.707
This way.

346
01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:38.749
We safe for now.

347
01:03:43.457 --> 01:03:47.832
You look like hell, Rambo.
- Tough night.

348
01:03:48.874 --> 01:03:51.041
Maybe need this.

349
01:03:53.499 --> 01:03:56.624
You hurt bad.
- It's alright.

350
01:04:03.666 --> 01:04:04.957
Listen.

351
01:04:05.749 --> 01:04:08.957
What you did back there

352
01:04:09.332 --> 01:04:11.499
I won't forget it.

353
01:04:13.332 --> 01:04:14.416
Thanks.

354
01:04:17.457 --> 01:04:18.624
What you do now?

355
01:04:19.291 --> 01:04:21.499
Try get across through Thailand?

356
01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:24.541
Yeah.
- Then go America?

357
01:04:31.624 --> 01:04:33.707
You take me with you?

358
01:04:44.957 --> 01:04:46.207
You take me?

359
01:04:48.582 --> 01:04:49.582
Yeah.

360
01:04:53.082 --> 01:04:54.582
I think you make good choice.

361
01:04:57.707 --> 01:04:59.166
We go?
- Let's go.

362
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:38.457
You alright?

363
01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:55.041
You not forget me.

364
01:05:55.166 --> 01:05:56.624
No.

365
01:06:15.291 --> 01:06:17.582
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

366
01:06:17.707 --> 01:06:22.666
You're risking everything.
Do you think one man's worth all that?

367
01:06:22.749 --> 01:06:23.749
Yes.

368
01:06:24.291 --> 01:06:28.749
I order you to withdraw.
- I'll go over your head.

369
01:06:28.874 --> 01:06:33.207
You don't seem to understand that I'm
in charge here. You're just a tool.

370
01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.874
We're the machine.

371
01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:39.874
He's not to leave the base.

372
01:06:44.749 --> 01:06:49.332
He never had a chance, did he?
- Like you said: He went home.

373
01:21:03.999 --> 01:21:05.041
Get back.

374
01:21:09.374 --> 01:21:11.957
Come on! To the chopper!

375
01:21:13.666 --> 01:21:15.749
To the chopper!

376
01:22:06.999 --> 01:22:08.082
You guys made it!

377
01:22:46.082 --> 01:22:48.291
Chopper on your tail!

378
01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:51.166
Hang on!

379
01:24:28.541 --> 01:24:29.791
Fire in the tail!

380
01:26:34.166 --> 01:26:36.291
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

381
01:26:37.707 --> 01:26:40.832
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

382
01:26:41.666 --> 01:26:45.207
Wolf's Den,
this is Lone wolf, do you read?

383
01:26:48.124 --> 01:26:49.624
We hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

384
01:26:49.749 --> 01:26:54.457
Prepare for emergency landing.
Arriving with American POWs.

385
01:27:06.832 --> 01:27:11.041
You heard. Prepare for landing of POWs!

386
01:28:27.791 --> 01:28:29.707
Glad you made it.

387
01:29:41.207 --> 01:29:43.999
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

388
01:29:44.124 --> 01:29:46.249
I take them, just like you.

389
01:29:50.624 --> 01:29:54.374
I swear to God I didn't know
it was supposed to happen like this.

390
01:29:54.999 --> 01:29:57.666
It was just supposed
to be another assignment.

391
01:30:08.082 --> 01:30:09.207
Accomplished!

392
01:30:16.791 --> 01:30:18.874
You know there are more men out there.

393
01:30:19.874 --> 01:30:21.457
You know where they are.

394
01:30:23.874 --> 01:30:27.374
Find them, or I'll find you!

395
01:30:52.499 --> 01:30:54.249
Where are you going?

396
01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.457
I don't know.

397
01:30:58.082 --> 01:31:01.207
You'll get
a second Medal of Honor for this.

398
01:31:09.082 --> 01:31:13.707
They should give it to them.
They deserve it more.

399
01:31:14.957 --> 01:31:18.541
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.

400
01:31:18.957 --> 01:31:21.166
Come back to us.

401
01:31:25.166 --> 01:31:27.791
My friends died here,

402
01:31:28.832 --> 01:31:31.082
and part of me died here.

403
01:31:32.124 --> 01:31:37.707
The war may have been wrong,
but don't hate your country for it.

404
01:31:40.957 --> 01:31:42.499
I'd die for it!

405
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:46.291
What is it you want?

406
01:31:51.666 --> 01:31:53.207
I want

407
01:31:55.624 --> 01:31:57.707
what they want,

408
01:31:58.124 --> 01:32:01.374
and every other guy who came out here

409
01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:06.124
and spilt his guts
and gave everything he had:

410
01:32:08.041 --> 01:32:10.499
For our country to love us

411
01:32:10.957 --> 01:32:13.082
as much as we love it.

412
01:32:15.749 --> 01:32:17.332
That's what I want.

413
01:32:24.124 --> 01:32:27.957
How will you live, John?
- Day by day.

414
01:35:22.124 --> 01:35:24.207
