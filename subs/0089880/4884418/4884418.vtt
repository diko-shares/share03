1
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.957
Let's keep those hammers working!

2
00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:02.908
Rambo!

3
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.706
Let's go.

4
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:31.283
How are you, Johnny?

5
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:33.036
Good.

6
00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:36.574
That's all.

7
00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:41.950
I'm sorry they sent you
to such a hellhole.

8
00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:44.573
I've seen worse.

9
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.742
Yeah, you have, haven't you

10
00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:52.202
I told you that I'd help you
when I could. Are you interested?

11
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.994
You can't possibly want
to stay here for another five years.

12
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.290
In here at least I know where I stand.
Just hear me out first.

13
00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:15.416
A covert operation
is being geared up in the Far East.

14
00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:20.742
A computer gave your name as one of
3 suitable candidates for the mission.

15
00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:25.246
Mission?
A hunt for POWs in Vietnam.

16
00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:32.204
Why now? Why me?

17
00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.538
The prison camp you escaped from in 71
is the target area.

18
00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:42.203
No one knows that terrain better
than you. The risk factor's very high.

19
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:46.164
You'd be temporarily reinstated in the
forces, and if the mission's successful,

20
00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.121
there may be a presidential pardon.

21
00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:52.832
You interested?

22
00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:00.749
Yeah.

23
00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:05.286
Good. I'll get the necessary clearance.

24
00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:10.786
The next time we meet will be in
Thailand with the special ops designate.

25
00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.369
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:14.499
All clear?
Yes, sir.

27
00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.284
I want you to know I did
what I could to keep you out of here.

28
00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:19.411
I know.

29
00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:27.000
Do we get to win this time?

30
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:29.123
This time's up to you.

31
00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:45.741
That'll be all.

32
00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:51.707
How're you doing, Rambo? I'm Ericson.
Why don't we make it over to the hangar?

33
00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:56.705
You're the chosen one, ha?

34
00:05:57.125 --> 00:06:00.948
You made
a helluva rep for yourself in 'Nam.

35
00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:03.458
I'm glad to be working with you.

36
00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.573
This place may not be heaven,
but at least you're out of the joint.

37
00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:13.994
He's here.

38
00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:18.991
Morning, John.

39
00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:22.621
This is Marshal Murdock.
He's in charge of special operations.

40
00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:24.783
Thank you, Colonel. Rambo,

41
00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:28.323
been looking forward to meeting you.
How was your trip? No problems?

42
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.698
Except for the damned heat, right?
I've never felt anything like it.

43
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.412
Come on in,
let's get down to business.

44
00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:39.740
I was glancing over your files.

45
00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:43.035
Makes pretty interesting reading.

46
00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:53.617
Rambo, John J., born 7.6.47, Bowie,
Arizona, of Indian-German descent.

47
00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:57.285
That's a helluva combination.
Joined the army 6.8.64,

48
00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.621
accepted special forces,
specialization: light weapons.

49
00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.833
Cross-trained as medic.
Helicopter and language qualified.

50
00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:08.866
59 confirmed kills, 2 silver stars,
4 bronze, 4 Purple Hearts,

51
00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:10.699
Medal of Honor.

52
00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:17.618
You got around, didn't you?
Incredible. Rambo, you're probably aware

53
00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:21.661
that there are almost 2,500 Americans
still missing in action in SE Asia.

54
00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:26.578
Most are presumed dead, but for the
families, Congress and many Americans

55
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.163
it's still an emotional issue.

56
00:07:29.792 --> 00:07:30.900
Give me something cold, please!

57
00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:36.532
Rambo, you certainly don't know
as much about me as I do you.

58
00:07:36.708 --> 00:07:40.076
I've honched with the 2nd Battalion,
3rd Marines, in Kon Turn in '66.

59
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.039
I lost a lot of good men,
so I know what you and every vet feels.

60
00:07:44.208 --> 00:07:48.498
Maybe the government and certain
segments of the population didn't care,

61
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:50.615
but my committee cares.

62
00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:54.581
It needs proof
that Americans are there.

63
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.286
Then we'll get 'em back.

64
00:07:56.708 --> 00:08:01.874
If there are any of our men at the POW
target camp, you're to take photos.

65
00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.740
Photos?
Only photos. Under no circumstances

66
00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:11.537
are you to engage the enemy.
I'm supposed to leave them there?

67
00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:14.451
I repeat:
do not engage the enemy!

68
00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:18.781
The assault team led by Colonel Trautman
will handle the extraction.

69
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:30.200
With your participation,
this mission has a better than average

70
00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:32.204
chance of succeeding.

71
00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:37.872
I'll meet you both
in the operations center in one hour.

72
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.323
From Thailand across Laos
into the mountains of Vietnam.

73
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.993
You'll be flying a ceiling
of 250 feet when you bail out.

74
00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.160
Think you can handle it?
I'll try.

75
00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:09.869
Since you're going in solo, you'll have
to take more equipment than ever before.

76
00:09:10.292 --> 00:09:14.081
And use it!
Don't try the blood-and-guts routine.

77
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.163
Let technology do most of the work.

78
00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:22.537
Forget the war. Remember the mission.
The old Vietnam is dead.

79
00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:27.119
Sir, I'm alive,
so it's still alive, isn't it?

80
00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:40.493
You may find this hard
to believe, but all this is for you.

81
00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:42.411
Impressed?

82
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:47.703
You'll get every modern piece
of equipment we have

83
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:49.537
to ensure your safety.

84
00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:53.281
You can feel totally safe because we
have the world's most advanced weapons.

85
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.162
I've always believed that the mind's
the best weapon.

86
00:09:59.042 --> 00:09:59.953
Times change.

87
00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:01.706
For some people.

88
00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:04.536
Don't let me interrupt.

89
00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:07.955
Upon insertion
call into base camp on Transat.

90
00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:11.789
Then proceed to rendezvous
with your ground contact,

91
00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:13.995
indigenous agent Co Bao.

92
00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:16.159
Is he listening?

93
00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:19.288
Indigenous agent Co Bao.

94
00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:28.040
Colonel!

95
00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:31.575
Are you sure he's not unbalanced?

96
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.323
What if he cracks under the pressure
in that hell?

97
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.490
Pressure?

98
00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:40.117
Rambo is the best combat vet
I've ever seen.

99
00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:44.952
A pure fighting machine with only
a desire to win a war someone else lost.

100
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:50.416
If winning means he has to die,
he'll die. No fear, no regrets.

101
00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:53.874
And one more thing:

102
00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:57.911
What you call "hell", he calls home.

103
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.833
Stand by! Start A.P.U.!

104
00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:29.745
D minus 20.

105
00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:03.124
D minus 5.

106
00:12:19.292 --> 00:12:24.367
You've got 36 hours to get in and out.
So don't stop to smell the roses, okay?

107
00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:31.289
If you run into trouble, try to get
to the hilltop extraction site.

108
00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:38.749
Good luck, son.
Thanks.

109
00:12:39.167 --> 00:12:40.749
Ready to roll.

110
00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:47.532
Murdock said he'd been
with the 2nd Battalion in Kon Tum '66.

111
00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:51.284
The 2nd Battalion was at Kud Sank.

112
00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:55.079
You're the only one that I trust.

113
00:13:37.542 --> 00:13:41.491
Think he'll find someone?
POWs? Doubtful.

114
00:13:41.667 --> 00:13:46.287
But there are people to satisfy,
questions that have to be answered.

115
00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:50.081
You don't sound too emotional about it.
It wasn't my war, Colonel.

116
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.992
I'm here to clean up the mess.

117
00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.329
K-Wok 2-5 is raft.

118
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.492
They're holding timeline.

119
00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:43.080
Affirmative, Wolf Den. Over.

120
00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.287
We're back in the badlands, my man.

121
00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:22.116
Stand by your position!

122
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.948
Insertion in 15 seconds.
Partytime!

123
00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:40.829
5 seconds.

124
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:01.038
What's happening?
He's hung up!

125
00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:05.624
He'll be torn apart!

126
00:16:07.458 --> 00:16:09.745
He's hung up!
What do you mean he's hung up?

127
00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:11.579
He's being dragged!

128
00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:15.787
Cut him loose!
I can't free him!

129
00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:40.535
Abort the mission!
That'll kill him! He'll be torn apart!

130
00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:45.911
He's cutting away his equipment.

131
00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:59.366
He's out!

132
00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:04.203
Here is Dragonfly 1. Do you read me?
Dragonfly 1, I read you.

133
00:17:04.375 --> 00:17:07.868
Any visual bearing by flares?
Negative. We didn't see anything.

134
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.165
Maybe it's best to abort
the mission now.

135
00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:22.245
Who could survive that?

136
00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.124
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

137
00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:29.116
He's got 36 hours to complete the
mission and reach the extraction point.

138
00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:32.501
We owe him that.
Of course we do.

139
00:17:33.375 --> 00:17:38.120
But understand something:
In 36 hours we pull out.

140
00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:23.328
Rambo!

141
00:19:37.792 --> 00:19:39.829
You did not expect a woman, no?

142
00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:43.832
We'd better go.

143
00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:51.282
We go to river.
How come you so late?

144
00:19:51.708 --> 00:19:53.290
I was hung up.

145
00:19:59.042 --> 00:20:03.286
I have arranged boat to take us
down river. Old ways not safe.

146
00:20:03.875 --> 00:20:07.494
You come a long way, Rambo,
to see empty camp.

147
00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:02.161
You're using pirates?

148
00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:06.407
Best way down river.
Not get army suspicious.

149
00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:29.791
What about patrol boats?

150
00:22:50.958 --> 00:22:52.324
Russian.

151
00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:20.744
Rambo,

152
00:23:22.292 --> 00:23:23.999
want to eat?

153
00:23:25.583 --> 00:23:27.620
Maybe later.

154
00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:37.869
How you get into this?

155
00:23:40.375 --> 00:23:43.994
It's a long story.
Long trip.

156
00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:50.201
After I left the special forces,

157
00:23:50.625 --> 00:23:55.120
I moved around a lot.
Why you leave army?

158
00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:56.619
I...

159
00:23:58.292 --> 00:24:01.000
came back to the States

160
00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:03.204
and found another war going on.

161
00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:06.374
What war?

162
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.412
Kind of like a quiet war.

163
00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:15.957
A war against the soldiers returning.

164
00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:17.366
The kind of war you don't win.

165
00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:26.501
It's my problem.
How did you get into it?

166
00:24:28.333 --> 00:24:32.373
My father
worked for intelligence agency.

167
00:24:33.417 --> 00:24:36.455
He killed, and I take his place.

168
00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:38.874
There's too much death here.

169
00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:41.039
Death everywhere.

170
00:24:45.458 --> 00:24:46.790
I just want to live.

171
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.790
Maybe go America. Live the quiet life.

172
00:24:58.458 --> 00:25:00.415
What you want?

173
00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:05.080
To win. To survive.

174
00:25:07.208 --> 00:25:10.747
Not so easy to survive. Still war here.

175
00:25:11.375 --> 00:25:15.324
To survive a war,
you've got to become war.

176
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.868
That why they pick you?
Because you like to fight?

177
00:25:24.083 --> 00:25:26.040
I am expendable.

178
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.332
What mean "expendable"?

179
00:25:32.875 --> 00:25:33.956
It's like

180
00:25:34.375 --> 00:25:39.450
someone invites you to a party
and you don't show up,

181
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.787
and it doesn't really matter.

182
00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:50.994
What's this?

183
00:25:52.458 --> 00:25:53.494
It bring me good luck.

184
00:25:56.208 --> 00:25:58.621
What bring you good luck?

185
00:26:06.125 --> 00:26:08.162
I guess this.

186
00:26:14.792 --> 00:26:16.283
No further reports.

187
00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:18.324
I want to go up
with the extraction team at dawn.

188
00:26:19.042 --> 00:26:20.704
Denied.
Denied?

189
00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:23.868
It's an unnecessary risk.
We have a schedule to keep.

190
00:26:24.042 --> 00:26:26.750
We don't even know if he's alive.
Unlikely.

191
00:26:26.917 --> 00:26:29.159
You said we'd go through as planned.

192
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.415
Okay, if you
want to go through with it, we will.

193
00:26:35.583 --> 00:26:37.370
The Colonel's
gonna be joining the extraction team.

194
00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:42.370
You're a damned good man, Trautman.

195
00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:42.162
See? Camp empty.

196
00:27:43.417 --> 00:27:45.500
We move closer.

197
00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:32.204
Cyclo-girl whore from village.

198
00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:38.040
Come on!

199
00:28:53.833 --> 00:28:56.905
What is it?
A bow. No sound.

200
00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:08.498
You not going in there.
You're supposed to only take pictures.

201
00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:09.994
What about orders?

202
00:29:11.167 --> 00:29:12.408
No more orders, Co.

203
00:32:55.958 --> 00:32:57.369
I've come to get you out.

204
00:32:59.208 --> 00:33:00.665
Don't talk.

205
00:33:29.292 --> 00:33:32.660
There are others.
I'll be back.

206
00:35:12.167 --> 00:35:13.123
Everything okay?

207
00:35:14.083 --> 00:35:15.665
Let's go!

208
00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:50.745
You have clearance.

209
00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:53.284
Minus one hour to extraction.

210
00:35:53.708 --> 00:35:56.780
I hope for his sake
we're not just wasting fuel.

211
00:35:57.208 --> 00:35:59.291
Let's get moving.

212
00:36:21.958 --> 00:36:23.574
A good thing you came when you did.

213
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:24.991
Why is that?

214
00:36:25.833 --> 00:36:29.406
They move us around a lot. Because
of the crops. Only been there a week.

215
00:36:30.417 --> 00:36:35.333
When were you last in that camp?
A year. What year is it, anyway?

216
00:36:36.375 --> 00:36:37.707
1985.

217
00:36:42.042 --> 00:36:44.034
Camp supposed to be empty.

218
00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:46.324
Yes, supposed to be.

219
00:37:19.542 --> 00:37:22.250
Landing zone a mile up river.

220
00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:25.913
What has happened?
We've been sold out.

221
00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:28.789
You bastard!

222
00:39:05.125 --> 00:39:07.788
Right, jump!
I fight!

223
00:39:08.417 --> 00:39:09.578
Jump! Go on!

224
00:40:05.333 --> 00:40:06.744
The gunboat!

225
00:40:24.833 --> 00:40:25.949
Jump!

226
00:40:38.458 --> 00:40:40.040
You made it, Rambo!

227
00:40:48.458 --> 00:40:49.665
Come on.

228
00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:16.707
Take this. We go on from here.

229
00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:20.534
Better I stay on to end.
This is the end.

230
00:41:22.125 --> 00:41:23.081
Come on.

231
00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:25.615
Rambo!

232
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.116
You not expendable.

233
00:41:52.792 --> 00:41:54.704
Colonel, 3 minutes.

234
00:43:07.208 --> 00:43:08.494
That's Rambo!

235
00:43:15.458 --> 00:43:16.494
Christ, he's found one!

236
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.117
Rambo's found one of ours!

237
00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:54.953
The ground crew has what appears to be
an American POW with him.

238
00:43:56.125 --> 00:43:59.243
What did you say?
They've got one of ours.

239
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.288
Yellow alert!
Meyers, Harrison, Goddell!

240
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:06.656
Everybody out! Move!

241
00:44:07.083 --> 00:44:09.200
Go to your COMINT frequency!
Give me the mike!

242
00:44:12.208 --> 00:44:16.248
Dragonfly, here is Coach 1.
This is a priority order.

243
00:44:18.083 --> 00:44:19.619
Come on!

244
00:44:22.958 --> 00:44:26.326
Abort the operation immediately!

245
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.914
This is a recall. Confirm. Over.
Say it again, Coach 1.

246
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:31.957
Abort the operation!

247
00:44:33.417 --> 00:44:37.616
I've been ordered to abort.
But we've got them in sight!

248
00:44:37.792 --> 00:44:39.328
Murdock, do you read?

249
00:44:43.417 --> 00:44:46.205
We're going down.
You're not going anywhere.

250
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:53.573
You damned mercenaries!
Those are our men down there!

251
00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:57.917
No, your men. Don't be a hero.

252
00:45:05.125 --> 00:45:06.286
Colonel!

253
00:45:06.958 --> 00:45:07.994
Down!

254
00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:52.372
What are you doing?
Do you know what the hell you've done?

255
00:45:52.917 --> 00:45:55.284
Don't act so innocent, Colonel.

256
00:45:55.667 --> 00:45:58.375
You had your suspicions,
which makes you a sort of accessory.

257
00:45:58.792 --> 00:46:01.535
Don't ever
count me with you and your scum!

258
00:46:01.958 --> 00:46:06.202
It was a lie, wasn't it.
Like the whole damned war. It was a lie.

259
00:46:06.625 --> 00:46:08.287
What are you talking about?

260
00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:11.375
That camp was supposed to be empty.

261
00:46:12.375 --> 00:46:16.995
Rambo goes in, finds no POWs,
Congress buys it, case closed.

262
00:46:17.417 --> 00:46:22.788
And if he happens to get caught,
nobody knows except you.

263
00:46:23.208 --> 00:46:25.871
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

264
00:46:26.292 --> 00:46:28.955
A stinking bureaucrat
who's trying to cover his ass.

265
00:46:29.125 --> 00:46:32.618
Not just mine. A nation's!

266
00:46:32.792 --> 00:46:37.617
Besides, it was your hero's fault. If
he had done what he was meant to do,

267
00:46:37.792 --> 00:46:42.583
we'd be out of this clean and simple.
He was just supposed to take pictures.

268
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.949
And if those pictures showed something,
they'd have been lost.

269
00:46:47.333 --> 00:46:50.292
You still don't understand
what this is all about.

270
00:46:50.458 --> 00:46:53.166
Same as always: Money.

271
00:46:53.333 --> 00:46:56.826
In '72 we were supposed to pay the Cong
4.5 billion in war reparation.

272
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.834
We reneged, they kept the POWs.

273
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.118
And you're doing the same thing
all over again.

274
00:47:03.292 --> 00:47:04.954
What would you do?

275
00:47:05.125 --> 00:47:10.245
Pay ransom for our men and finance
the war effort against our allies?

276
00:47:10.417 --> 00:47:13.285
And if some burnt-out POW
shows up on the 6 o'clock news?

277
00:47:13.458 --> 00:47:18.499
Do you want to start the war over again
and bomb Hanoi?

278
00:47:18.667 --> 00:47:21.705
You think the Senate's

279
00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:24.913
going to pay billions
for a few forgotten ghosts?

280
00:47:25.083 --> 00:47:27.541
For men!
Men who fought for their country!

281
00:47:27.708 --> 00:47:28.744
That's enough!

282
00:47:30.333 --> 00:47:34.907
Trautman, I'm going to forget
this conversation ever took place.

283
00:47:36.875 --> 00:47:39.618
You bastard!
And if I were you,

284
00:47:40.125 --> 00:47:43.163
I'd not make the mistake
of bringing it up again.

285
00:47:43.333 --> 00:47:44.869
You're making the mistake.

286
00:47:45.042 --> 00:47:46.453
Yes? What mistake?

287
00:47:48.083 --> 00:47:49.369
Rambo.

288
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.583
Damned Russian bastards.

289
00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:17.995
He's dead now.

290
00:49:28.208 --> 00:49:29.949
Bring him up!

291
00:49:49.292 --> 00:49:50.578
The knife!

292
00:49:51.417 --> 00:49:54.160
These people
are so vulgar in their methods!

293
00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:57.742
They lack compassion.

294
00:50:00.375 --> 00:50:03.664
I'm Lieutenant-Colonel Podovski.

295
00:50:05.458 --> 00:50:07.666
I do not know who you are yet,

296
00:50:08.292 --> 00:50:09.954
but I will.

297
00:50:10.792 --> 00:50:11.953
Take him and clean him up.

298
00:50:46.875 --> 00:50:48.411
That's all.

299
00:50:48.792 --> 00:50:52.706
Thank you, Captain Vinh.
Leave one guard, please.

300
00:50:57.375 --> 00:51:00.664
I see you are no stranger to pain.

301
00:51:01.083 --> 00:51:04.451
Perhaps you have been
among my Vietnamese comrades before?

302
00:51:07.625 --> 00:51:08.661
No answer?

303
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.242
Do you wish to give your name?

304
00:51:12.875 --> 00:51:15.993
What possible harm can that cause?

305
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:21.791
Pride is a poor substitute
for intelligence.

306
00:51:23.042 --> 00:51:26.001
What you must understand
is that we must interrogate you.

307
00:51:28.833 --> 00:51:33.077
For Sergeant Yushin you're a piece
of meat, a laboratory experiment.

308
00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.618
But for me you are a comrade,
similar to myself,

309
00:51:37.292 --> 00:51:40.490
just opposed by an act of fate.

310
00:51:42.292 --> 00:51:44.534
I know you were trying

311
00:51:44.708 --> 00:51:49.032
to facilitate the release
of war criminals. I can appreciate this.

312
00:51:50.292 --> 00:51:54.161
But this incident, your capture, is

313
00:51:56.333 --> 00:51:57.369
embarrassing.

314
00:51:58.167 --> 00:51:59.874
We must have an explanation.

315
00:52:00.625 --> 00:52:03.584
I want you to radio your HQ

316
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:06.743
and say that
you have been captured and condemned

317
00:52:06.917 --> 00:52:09.125
for espionage,

318
00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:13.536
and that attempts like these
should not be made in the future,

319
00:52:14.125 --> 00:52:18.290
or they
will meet with the same fate as you.

320
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:29.116
Fuck you!

321
00:52:32.042 --> 00:52:35.456
You wish to test your strength Good.

322
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.411
Yushin!

323
00:53:41.542 --> 00:53:43.124
Comrade, here is something

324
00:53:44.375 --> 00:53:46.958
that might be of interest to you:

325
00:53:47.375 --> 00:53:51.369
a transcript of the conversation
between your helicopter pilot

326
00:53:51.542 --> 00:53:54.831
and his commander that we intercepted.

327
00:53:56.417 --> 00:54:00.832
"Dragonfly" and "Wolf's Den"
Colorful names.

328
00:54:01.708 --> 00:54:02.824
Here we are:

329
00:54:03.292 --> 00:54:05.579
"We have them in sight".

330
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:10.120
And the reply:
"Abort the operation immediately."

331
00:54:11.708 --> 00:54:15.907
"This is a recall. Confirm. Over."

332
00:54:17.208 --> 00:54:20.952
It seems you were abandoned
by direct command.

333
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:26.199
And these are the people
you protect with your pain!

334
00:54:26.375 --> 00:54:28.537
Increase the voltage.

335
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:33.869
You may scream. There is no shame.

336
00:55:04.833 --> 00:55:07.746
You are strong! Very strong!

337
00:55:07.917 --> 00:55:09.658
The strongest so far.

338
00:55:10.625 --> 00:55:13.823
But you're nearly dead. Poor waif.

339
00:55:14.542 --> 00:55:16.579
Make the radio call.

340
00:55:42.458 --> 00:55:45.747
To talk, to obey
would be so much easier.

341
00:56:00.458 --> 00:56:03.530
Yushin
has a memento for you of this day.

342
00:56:25.542 --> 00:56:27.750
Put it in his eye.

343
00:56:34.625 --> 00:56:39.120
If your own life
means nothing to you, perhaps his does.

344
00:56:39.292 --> 00:56:42.911
Don't tell them anything!
You will talk.

345
00:56:53.292 --> 00:56:54.248
Yes?

346
00:57:29.792 --> 00:57:31.203
Don't do it!

347
00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:35.245
Do it

348
00:57:35.417 --> 00:57:36.783
Now!

We read you,
Lone Wolf. What is your position? Over.

355
00:58:30.292 --> 00:58:32.955
I say again:
What is your position? Over.

356
00:58:34.625 --> 00:58:38.244
Your friend dies if you do not answer.

357
00:58:40.167 --> 00:58:42.204
This is Trautman. Where are you?

358
00:58:47.292 --> 00:58:48.373
Come in!

359
00:58:57.417 --> 00:58:58.373
Murdock

360
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.616
He's here.

361
00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:08.200
Rambo, we're glad you're alive.

362
00:59:09.167 --> 00:59:13.332
Where are you? Give us your position,
and we'll come to pick you up.

363
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:23.331
Murdock

364
00:59:26.833 --> 00:59:28.574
I'm coming to get you!

365
01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:52.286
Duck!

366
01:02:57.417 --> 01:02:58.703
This way.

367
01:03:36.667 --> 01:03:38.750
We safe for now.

368
01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:47.828
You look like hell, Rambo.
Tough night.

369
01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:51.037
Maybe need this.

370
01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.618
You hurt bad.
It's alright.

371
01:04:03.667 --> 01:04:04.953
Listen

372
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.948
What you did back there

373
01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:11.495
I won't forget it.

374
01:04:13.333 --> 01:04:14.414
Thanks.

375
01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:18.619
What you do now?

376
01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:21.500
Try get across through Thailand?

377
01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:24.535
Yeah.
Then go America?

378
01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:33.708
You take me with you?

379
01:04:44.958 --> 01:04:46.199
You take me?

380
01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:49.539
Yeah.

381
01:04:53.083 --> 01:04:54.574
I think you make good choice.

382
01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:59.165
We go?
Let's go.

383
01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:38.454
You alright?

384
01:05:52.042 --> 01:05:55.035
You not forget me.

385
01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:56.619
No.

386
01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:17.579
I want the rescue team
ready to go in one hour.

387
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:22.575
You're risking everything.
Do you think one man's worth all that?

388
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:23.661
Yes.

389
01:06:24.292 --> 01:06:28.741
I order you to withdraw.
I'll go over your head.

390
01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:33.207
You don't seem to understand that I'm
in charge here. You're just a tool.

391
01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:36.866
We're the machine.

392
01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:39.875
He's not to leave the base.

393
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:49.324
He never had a chance, did he?
Like you said: He went home.

394
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.036
Get back.

395
01:21:09.375 --> 01:21:11.958
Come on! To the chopper!

396
01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:13.366
Move!

397
01:21:13.708 --> 01:21:15.745
To the chopper!

398
01:21:32.792 --> 01:21:33.953
Move!

399
01:22:07.042 --> 01:22:08.078
You guys made it!

400
01:22:46.125 --> 01:22:48.287
Chopper on your tail!

401
01:22:50.167 --> 01:22:51.123
Hang on!

402
01:24:20.208 --> 01:24:21.198
Hold on!

403
01:24:28.583 --> 01:24:29.790
Fire in the tail!

404
01:26:34.167 --> 01:26:36.284
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

405
01:26:37.708 --> 01:26:40.826
Lone Wolf calling Wolf's Den. Over.

406
01:26:41.667 --> 01:26:45.206
Wolf's Den,
this is Lone wolf, do you read?

407
01:26:48.125 --> 01:26:49.616
We hear you, Lone Wolf. Over.

408
01:26:49.792 --> 01:26:54.457
Prepare for emergency landing.
Arriving with American POWs.

409
01:27:06.833 --> 01:27:11.032
You heard. Prepare for landing of POWs!

410
01:28:27.792 --> 01:28:29.704
Glad you made it.

411
01:29:41.208 --> 01:29:43.996
Rambo, I don't make the orders.

412
01:29:44.167 --> 01:29:46.250
I take them, just like you.

413
01:29:50.625 --> 01:29:54.369
I swear to God I didn't know
it was supposed to happen like this.

414
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.663
It was just supposed
to be another assignment.

415
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:05.911
Mission

416
01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:09.199
accomplished!

417
01:30:16.792 --> 01:30:18.875
You know there are more men out there.

418
01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:21.457
You know where they are.

419
01:30:23.875 --> 01:30:27.368
Find them, or I'll find you!

420
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.241
Where are you going?

421
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:56.457
I don't know.

422
01:30:58.083 --> 01:31:01.201
You'll get
a second Medal of Honor for this.

423
01:31:09.083 --> 01:31:13.703
They should give it to them.
They deserve it more.

424
01:31:14.958 --> 01:31:18.531
You can't keep running, John.
You're free now.

425
01:31:18.958 --> 01:31:21.166
Come back to us.

426
01:31:22.292 --> 01:31:24.124
Back to what?

427
01:31:25.167 --> 01:31:27.784
My friends died here,

428
01:31:28.833 --> 01:31:31.075
and part of me died here.

429
01:31:32.125 --> 01:31:37.701
The war may have been wrong,
but don't hate your country for it.

430
01:31:38.583 --> 01:31:39.573
Hate it?

431
01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:42.494
I'd die for it!

432
01:31:44.417 --> 01:31:46.283
What is it you want?

433
01:31:51.667 --> 01:31:53.203
I want

434
01:31:55.625 --> 01:31:57.708
what they want,

435
01:31:58.125 --> 01:32:01.368
and every other guy who came out here

436
01:32:01.792 --> 01:32:06.116
and spilt his guts
and gave everything he had:

437
01:32:08.042 --> 01:32:10.500
For our country to love us

438
01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:13.075
as much as we love it.

439
01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:17.332
That's what I want.

440
01:32:24.125 --> 01:32:27.948
How will you live, John?
Day by day.
