1
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,578
Go to hell.

2
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,175
Don't dare come here again. This
house'll not be knocked down.

3
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,458
Isn't rude to take people's
land and their house?

4
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,779
Mother if they don't knock it
down it'll be flooded.

5
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,691
they won't stop the dam for you

6
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,930
No. They can drown me if they like.

7
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,493
I know you. You want to sell the
house and move to town.

8
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,211
There's nothing left for us.
You'll have.

9
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,776
To do what they want. I hope it
won't be to late.

10
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,095
I won't do it. And forget about
the city.

11
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,855
I'm taking the milk.

12
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,456
You're crazy. Who's going to
see me?

13
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,090
They might, times have changed.
Just get married.

14
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,174
Stop dreaming about the city.

15
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,813
- Do you like it?.
- Don't be late.

16
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,298
- You'll be sorry
- Why?

17
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,019
I told you to stop it.

18
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:41,776
Don't mind him. It's just a joke.

19
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,892
Leave that hose.

20
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,256
The joke's over.

21
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,770
- Leave that hose.
- Alright, don't get mad.

22
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:59,979
I told you don't go near that
boy's truck.

23
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,338
I'll get him and his truck one day.

24
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,813
Let's hope it's a long trip.

25
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,170
Did I bother you?

26
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,848
Why did you call me?.

27
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,018
A job. You carry sand
to the dam.

28
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,251
I will not drive my truck to
that swamp.

29
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,370
You're funny. After all the truck
belongs to the company.

30
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,930
You were going to give me
long trips.

31
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,372
You love your truck more than
me. I'm jealous.

32
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,650
I painted it myself. Going
through that swamp.

33
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,134
I'll find you a new job in
a few day.

34
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,449
Alright.

35
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,135
Sorry friend.

36
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,492
It's a hell of a job.

37
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,848
Now we've really had it.

38
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,977
She did it on purpose, she's
jealous of you, she said so.

39
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,536
Don't stop there stupid man.

40
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,853
Don't wait grandma, I can't
take you.

41
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,171
I'm not a grandma.

42
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,895
What are you then?.

43
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,851
What a pretty girl?.

44
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,890
He's nice looking. Not from
these parts.

45
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,935
Mustn't scare the bird.

46
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,499
If mother knew.

47
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,898
Wait a minute. Little Red Scarf.

48
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,369
If I stop, that's the end.

49
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,253
Give us some milk.

50
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,333
Drinking milk like a baby.
Silly boy.

51
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,412
It's up to you friend. Get me
out of this swamp.

52
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,014
Leave us go you bloody mud.

53
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,613
Well done friend.

54
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,095
He is coming.

55
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,534
"I hunted a partridge on
a plane"

56
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,855
"I hung the Red Scarf on
a branch"

57
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,377
Get in, I'll give you a lift.

58
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,014
He is from Istanbul.

59
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,580
Behaving like a city smoothie,
in a swamp.

60
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,419
I'll take you to the village.

61
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,656
My mother will kill me.

62
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,338
Will she get in or not.

63
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,250
Shall I get in or not?

64
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,289
Why shouldn't I have some fun?

65
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,852
It's not wrong to fancy someone.

66
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,370
Let mother hear it.

67
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,012
Success, friend.

68
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,211
My name's Ilyas. The truck's
'Carefree Heart'.

69
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:20,490
She won't speak, why?

70
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,218
Doesn't like us?.

71
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,895
We don't care. As long as she smiles.

72
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,015
I'll get down here.

73
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,092
Will you help me out of the mud
tomorrow same place?

74
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,931
On the road, they might see us.

75
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,179
I'll wait by the fort,
Red Scarf.

76
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,968
I won't go till you tell me
your name.

77
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,658
Asya

78
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,692
Is she crazy?.

79
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,651
Where the hell have you been?

80
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,935
Get cleaned. They came to ask
your hand.

81
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,416
Promise you won't paint me
again or I'll go in like this.

82
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,335
Silly girl. I swear no more
paint.

83
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,536
- They are going to marry you.
- How did you know?.

84
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,015
They came to look at you, they
spoked with father.

85
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,448
- Will you marry him?
- Can I say no to mother?.

86
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,489
- Don't get married.
- Why?

87
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,450
- Then you'll go away.
- I'll take you with me.

88
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,375
When I grow I'll be a driver.
I'll take you to Istanbul.

89
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,896
Let's give a name.
- Good.

90
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,452
Let's call it "Carefree Heart".

91
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,933
Where are you sneaking off to?

92
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,371
Borrow some tread from Halime.

93
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,576
You got dolled up for that.

94
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,050
If you like I'll paint my face.

95
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,731
- Go on.
- I'm fed up.

96
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,013
Be happy, you're geting married.

97
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,417
You'll be happy.

98
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,494
Get back quick. They'll come
tomorrow, we've a lot to do.

99
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,419
I wish he break his neck.

100
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,737
Little Red Scarf is not coming.

101
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,330
Then we'll gota her.

102
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,768
She's gone in to the house.

103
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,217
If she asks, tell her I went to
Hanife.

104
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,495
What's the matter?

105
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,413
What are you staring at?

106
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,129
I'd rather be flooded. I won't
let you touch my house.

107
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,217
Over my dead body. You pigs.

108
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,816
Get out of here.

109
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,535
- Go.
- Not without you.

110
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,534
- Please go.
- Come tomorrow to the fort.

111
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,855
I'll come go.

112
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,850
I love you Little Red Scarf.

113
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,055
- What did you talk with him?.
- I told him to go.

114
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,411
Good. Was we send from the dam?.

115
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,210
I don't know. I suppose so.

116
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,412
Trying to frighten me. I'll
never leave this house.

117
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,537
I wish I had a lovely truck
like that.

118
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,779
I told you she will come.

119
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,491
I came to tell you not to
bother me again.

120
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,931
I shall be married soon.

121
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,735
They will not give such a
pretty girl to me.

122
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,498
Break the engagement, can't you?.

123
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,219
Do you, live him?

124
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,372
- I don't know him.
- You don't know him.

125
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,414
What if he is an old man?
Or lame?

126
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:38,093
He might be blind.

127
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I've found you and I don't want
to lose you again.

128
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,009
There's nothing I can do.

129
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
Why did I feel like that when
he touched me?

130
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,130
I'll wait here tomorrow.

131
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,859
And I'd come running
if I could.

132
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,573
So he got fed up waiting?
He left us both.

133
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:41,730
Does he leave his love so
quickly?

134
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:54,494
You say he is crazy.
You should't say such things.

135
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,850
ls he watching us?
I don't believe it.

136
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,574
So you are pulling me apart.

137
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:13,617
- I've been waiting since noon
- I couldn't run away before.

138
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,974
I'll wait a month for you,
a whole year.

139
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,818
Will you take me to the village?.

140
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,013
Is that what they call love?.

141
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,369
I hold his hand, it was so warm.

142
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,133
What's going to come of this?
Nothing.

143
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:52,655
They told me to be afraid of
men. But I'm not afraid of him.

144
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,096
I've no house no money.

145
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,697
He's from the city. Lots of
girls there. Why me?

146
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,449
Why don't I want her to get married?.

147
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,656
- What happened to him?.
- To whom?.

148
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,496
The one you're going to marry,
have you seen him?

149
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:15,014
No. They came today. They are
relatives of my mother.

150
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,849
Did your family agree to the
marriage?

151
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,940
Yes. I'll get out here.

152
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,294
Are you angry?

153
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,973
You won't come again.

154
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,814
Don't get angry, there's nothing
I can do.

155
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:44,693
- Go on - Look at
me. - Thank you.

156
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,172
I got you a long trip, starting
today.

157
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,618
Didn't you want a long trip?.

158
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,134
I've got to go the dam.

159
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:24,049
What's so special about that dam?. You
haven't worked for two days anyway.

160
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,171
I don't want a long trip.

161
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,934
I can't change it.

162
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,416
It was hell getting you this job.

163
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,812
Will you change with me. I'll
give you 500 liras.

164
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,169
He must have something going
at the dam.

165
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,412
- What's this all about?.
- I don't have to tell you.

166
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,056
These are your loading and
unloading places.

167
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,169
They'll sack you.

168
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,489
If I hold her hand, will she
come with me?.

169
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,655
I'm yours. All you have to do
is take me.

170
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,855
Friend, say hello to my girl.

171
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,531
Nice to see you friend.

172
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,492
Friends, say hello to my girl.

173
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,815
Hello great fort.

174
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,500
Hello loneyl tree. Haven't you
a sweet heart...

175
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,815
You goats, say hello to my girl.

176
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,814
The Istanbul Kid.

177
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,819
I'll talk to the manager, wait here.

178
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,449
- Will they fire you?
- Let them, I don't care.

179
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,532
So that's the thing at the dam.
stupid guy.

180
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,619
To give up Dilek for that
little thing.

181
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,416
I wouldn't give you up for anything.

182
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,258
Dirty beast. God dam all of you.

183
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,528
You're comitted to her now.

184
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,809
What about the wedding?

185
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,896
Well have to go to town. I have
no money no work.

186
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,008
My brother in law has a house
in the village.

187
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,450
Let's get the ceremony over
first. And don't.

188
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,659
Delay the offical wedding.

189
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,734
The bride will stay with us
until the wedding.

190
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,813
You're always there to help me.

191
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,295
Here's my bride.

192
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,528
What happened?.

193
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,456
I wasn't fired. He helped us.
I get a week of.

194
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,016
You're all invited to my wedding.

195
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,938
I'll bring Dilek along, don't worry.

196
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,168
We were married in the canteen
of the company.

197
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,809
We invited my family but they
didn't come.

198
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,735
Mother sent word that she had
no dughter named Asya.

199
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,178
Ilyas is crazy. How can I do
these modern dances?.

200
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:31,857
Will he get mad if can't
do it?. It's not my fault.

201
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,738
The woman I saw the first day
is called Dilek.

202
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,375
I don't care. I don't like the
man with her.

203
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,449
A wedding dress never suited
anyone as it does her.

204
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,332
The village was beautiful, our
house too.

205
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,212
Everybody brought something it's
so nice to get.

206
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,489
Presents I'd never had any
before.

207
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,413
I worked harder.

208
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,537
I sometimes waited days for
him. I never knew.

209
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,937
When he would be back, but I
know he would come.

210
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,369
I longed to get back and see my wife

211
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:05,733
At first I was a shamed to hell him.

212
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,731
I'm going to be a father. How
strange it fells.

213
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,613
The they was getting nearer.
I wanted a boy.

214
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,332
So that he would love me more.

215
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,500
I didn't want that job. It was
an urgent load.

216
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:39,898
I didn't want that job. It was
an urgent load.

217
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,611
Only I could get it there in time.

218
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,251
I was afraid of missing the
birth of my son.

219
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,337
Could I have know that this
man would change my life.

220
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,209
We are in trouble, can you help us.

221
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,014
Help you?. I'm in a hungry

222
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,933
We have'll passengers, there's a
danger of landslide.

223
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,458
And we'll freeze to death by
morning.

224
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,460
I have a heavy load, and I must
get it there in time.

225
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,090
Is your load more important
then those lifes?

226
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,415
We can't tow on this road.

227
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,928
There's no other way. Will you do it?.

228
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:21,572
Do you want to be killed?

229
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,539
Isn't there any hope?

230
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,613
My wife is alono and she's
going to have a baby.

231
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,777
These people have children too.

232
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,179
Will do it, don't worry.

233
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,539
- Get inside, you'll freeze.
- When the road gets better.

234
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,656
There's a precipice, there's
been a landslide.

235
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:11,773
- It's a boy.
- Ilyas will be pleased.

236
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,969
Get it to the right, be careful.

237
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,292
He's doing it purposely.

238
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,972
Playing hero with the boss's
truck.

239
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,290
- Do you know him?
- He's from our company.

240
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,813
Is that a gas station ahead?

241
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,293
- You've made it.
- We made it.

242
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,408
You have a son.

243
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,499
So this is my son?.

244
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,898
Were you that small when you
were born?

245
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,416
- And you too.
- Was I?

246
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,650
- Careful.
- What shall we call him?.

247
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,816
- You decide.
- I haven't tought. Samet, alright?

248
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,292
It's not a joke being a father.

249
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,415
Congratulations, it's a boy.

250
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,579
I hate to give you bad news on
such a day.

251
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,858
You towed a bus trough the pass

252
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,338
They fired you as driver, you're
in maintenance.

253
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,614
Cleaning other people's filthy
trucks? I quit.

254
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,172
Don't be silly. Think of your
wife and the boy.

255
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,771
Without them you could do as
you like.

256
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,499
- Is the manager in?
- He's got visitors.

257
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,136
Think of your wife and boy.

258
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,899
I'll see him later.

259
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,009
He didn't come home till down.
For the first time.

260
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,250
He was drunk. He'd never looked
at me like that.

261
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,968
There was something wrong but
he wouldn't tell me.

262
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,529
He didn't even look to Samet.
It must be my fault.

263
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,210
It couldn't be the tiny baby's.

264
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,415
They had taken his truck.

265
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,689
He can't live without his
truck, it's his friend.

266
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,617
Why don't you talk with the
manager?

267
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,929
He doesn't know the real story.
He didn't do it for fun.

268
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,049
He saved the lives of those
people.

269
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,538
It might be good but, I don't know.

270
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,210
This isn't woman business. Ilyas
may be angry.

271
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,530
What else can you do?.

272
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,408
It's been over a month. He never
drank before.

273
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:00,289
Now he won't eat, talk even
won't play with his sun.

274
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,371
Don't wait Grandma, I can't
take you.

275
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,013
- I'm not a grandma.
- What are you then?

276
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,689
Did you send your wife to manager?

277
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,974
They're saying that you send your
pretty wife to the manager.

278
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,849
- Who says so?
- She's there. Go and look.

279
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,489
He says that the truck and the
load is worth more than people.

280
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,851
I brought her. You can't touch her.

281
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,291
Mind your own business.

282
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,938
You're a pimp.

283
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,933
Let them get it out.

284
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:52,698
- Say it again.
- You're a pimp.

285
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,131
Didn't you send your wife?.

286
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,209
Leave me alone, you're not my
friends.

287
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,013
Didn't you send your wife?.

288
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,658
That night he didn't come home.

289
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,213
Nor the next, it was my fault.

290
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,054
We waited.

291
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,613
She's only a ignorant girl. She
can't understand me.

292
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,650
I couldn't take what had
happened. I was alone.

293
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,936
I always heard "without them you
could do as you like".

294
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,972
I could talk freely and get
drunk only at Dilek's house.

295
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,768
I was helpless. I found shelter
with her.

296
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,530
We waited months. He would come back.

297
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,057
He was my husband, Samet's
father, our everything.

298
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,977
I knew would come with his truck.

299
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,651
I was passing, I tought I'd drop in.

300
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,258
Don't wait for him, he's staying
Dilek now.

301
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,769
I didn't sleep that night. I got
to the house before.

302
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,535
Dawn, it was a lie. I wouldn't
believe it if I saw it.

303
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,697
I won't believe it.

304
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,369
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

305
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:55,612
Your wife came. I saw her by the
kitchen window.

306
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,410
She's your wife, you have a child.
I love you but...

307
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:06,655
Little Red Scarf. I never loved
anyone but you.

308
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,852
- Where are you going?.
- That way.

309
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,135
I'm turning off towards
the mill.

310
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,172
You'll have to get in the back.
I have a sick passenger.

311
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,611
Give me the child.

312
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,139
- Hold my hand.
- I can climb in.

313
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,056
Go to the corner, the baby
musn't get cold.

314
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,379
A pretty girl. Where can she
be going?

315
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,888
Where will be go?
Who will help us?

316
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,812
She is in trouble.

317
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:59,533
He is craying from cold. Give
him to me.

318
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:08,899
It's just the cold. I know. I had
two children.

319
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,293
He talk as if they were dead.
Got forbid.

320
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,610
If anything happened to Samet
I couldn't live.

321
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,255
Now he's warm he fell a sleep.
It's a boy.

322
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,493
He seems kind.

323
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,897
I wonder is he is looking for us?

324
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,293
What do you want? Get out of
my house.

325
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:59,176
You made a laughing stock of us

326
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,131
Why didn't you bring my sister?.

327
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,416
- Here we are.
- Where are we?

328
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,374
This is the mill. We are going
towards the river.

329
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,897
You get down.

330
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,936
This is where you're going.

331
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,970
- How are you?.
- Not bad.

332
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,378
- Like some tea?
- Just a glass of water.

333
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:14,732
Two teas for us. A glass of
water to the bus

334
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,653
- I'm thinking of that girl.
- She was pretty.

335
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,096
No. She looked as if she didn't
know where sha was going.

336
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,978
Why does my heart throb?

337
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,252
You haven't drunk your tea.

338
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:22,014
Don't be afraid.

339
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,972
You have now here to go.
The weathers bad.

340
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,653
Stay with us tonight.
You can go tomorrow.

341
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,973
Think of the baby.

342
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,252
What can I do?. God help me?.

343
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:51,975
Is the house empty?.

344
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,774
Don't worry, I sleep in the
other room.

345
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,497
Close the door, the baby will
get cold.

346
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,496
If Ilyas was only with me.

347
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,173
My poor baby.

348
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,932
- There's food in the cupboard
- I'm not hungry.

349
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,976
There some milk too. No one
will hurt you here.

350
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,058
I'm a foreman on the roads,
you can trust me.

351
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,411
Build the fire before you go to
sleep.

352
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:23,495
Were we wrong in coming here?
But what could we do?

353
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,098
The baby is sick. He dind't
sleep. He has a fever.

354
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:54,816
He's cauhght cold, he's a fever.

355
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,016
Will he be alright?

356
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,137
Don't worry. Children are hardy.

357
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,375
I'll fetch a doctor.

358
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,494
Where's your daddy, where's my Ilyas?

359
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,137
Don't cry. He'll bring a doctor.

360
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,970
Tomorrow we'll go back to your father.

361
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:41,409
- How is he?
- He's in a fever.

362
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,377
He's temperature will fall.

363
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,814
Who will give him an injektion?

364
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,614
I'll do it.

365
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,251
You sould be careful for a week
Don't take him out.

366
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,772
We can't stay here.

367
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,489
She's a relative of mine. She
was going back tomorrow.

368
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,369
The baby's life is at stake.
Could turn to pneumoins.

369
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:07,814
But how can we stay?.

370
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,009
Little Samet will be here
another week.

371
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,537
How I missed having children
in the house.

372
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,052
He's good a man. What would I
have done with the baby?

373
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:24,252
Ilyas will be mad now.

374
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,256
Come on, little lion, take it.

375
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,776
Must we do this?

376
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,410
Hold him tight.

377
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:02,973
He's laughing.

378
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,333
- Where did he get these?
- I bought them today.

379
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,809
This is for you.

380
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,889
I'm sorry, but I heard Samet.

381
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,977
I haven't sleept the last few
nights.

382
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,859
The door was open, he was about
to start crying.

383
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,731
Come on the back to mother.

384
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,450
The fever has gone. He'll be
fine tomorrow.

385
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,890
Tea's ready. I'll be leaving soon.

386
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,419
- We must go.
- Samet isn't right yet.

387
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:12,258
Don't bother. We'll wait on the road.

388
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,976
You'll catch cold. I'll stop
a car for you.

389
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,979
They won't stop, what can I do?

390
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,212
They are going to fast. I didn't
like the look of one.

391
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,690
One had a broken window, Samet
would get cold.

392
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,415
You're going home.

393
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,810
You love your husband.

394
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,450
Can't you go tomorrow?.

395
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,018
I thought I could never look to
another woman.

396
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,133
She will go tomorrow. To the
husband she loves.

397
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,330
I prepared some food. Will you
eat with us?

398
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,897
I was working on a bridge in
the east.

399
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,340
When I heard about the earth
quake I run back home.

400
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:16,850
Our house was a heap of rubble.
My wife, my two children were dead...

401
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,937
I thougt I would die. But work
saved me

402
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:27,250
But I couldn't forget the past.
I'd stopped living.

403
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,013
You and Samet have given me
a reason to live.

404
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:54,737
- So you came back.
- Will he forgive me?.

405
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:57,691
Ilyas is gone.

406
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:02,093
- With whom?.
- He was like a mad man.

407
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,378
- With whom?.
- He was like a mad man.

408
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,456
He wasn't a man to marry. But he
loved you.

409
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,729
With whom?.

410
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,772
He went with Dilek.

411
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:24,493
He will come back soon.

412
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,809
Are you going to your mother?.

413
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,338
Stay with us a few days.

414
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,333
Stupid Istanbul Kid...

415
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:14,369
If you had found him, I would
have gone.

416
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:26,255
- Where are you going?.
- To work in the city.

417
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:32,693
I'll find you work, if you like.

418
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,336
I found her work in anearby
co-operative weaving rugs...

419
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,737
As I returned from work I
watched the trucks.

420
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,974
Perhaps I would see Ilyas.
I couldn't forget him.

421
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:01,091
I knew she still loved him.
But I waited.

422
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,018
I waited for the day she would
love me.

423
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,977
Where was Ilyas?
Stili with that woman?

424
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,896
I hope they won't have children.

425
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,374
I hoped that my love would
bring him here one day.

426
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,578
She was still waiting for him.

427
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:38,696
I wanted her to wait for me to
come from work.

428
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:44,335
I knew he loved us, but what
could I do?

429
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:48,816
I could leave but starting a
new life is scaring...

430
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:14,178
He was friendly, I trusted him.
The memories.

431
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,615
Of the past, good or bad,
began to fade.

432
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:39,054
- What's this?.
- A swing.

433
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,371
- Samet is to small.
- He can use it when he's older.

434
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,099
Samet will grow, he will use
the swing.

435
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:10,412
He was planning our future.
We were to stay with him.

436
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:17,457
As guests, as lodgers. How was I
to talk of him to Samet?

437
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:30,099
Samet would grow, get on the
swing, ask questions.

438
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,417
She still waits for him.

439
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:09,096
I was waiting for you. You're
late. I was worried.

440
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:22,816
Time was passing.

441
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,456
Samet was growing, he could
ride on the swing.

442
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,896
Mummy, come on.

443
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,377
Let's swing together.

444
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,656
Daddy made this for you.

445
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:50,730
Mummy, daddy.

446
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,896
My son.

447
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,412
Samet called him "Daddy".
He chose him as father.

448
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:09,852
Do you Jemsit Kirach, take Asya
Meram as your lawful wife?

449
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:15,896
Do you Asya Meram take Jemsit
Kirach as your lawful husband?.

450
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,615
It wasn't as exciting as the
first wedding.

451
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:23,015
I thought she would say "No".
Could she forget him.

452
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,458
My first marriage wasn't even
legal. I was upset...

453
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:34,018
Was this happiness?.

454
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:39,774
I had him once. I loved him.

455
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:43,453
Was it love?.

456
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,339
Was it love?.

457
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:51,414
The ripling stream. The leaves
fluttering in the wind.

458
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,488
The beathing of my herth.

459
01:04:57,540 --> 01:05:00,896
The river will calm down. The
leaves will fall.

460
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,458
But what was love?.

461
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:13,092
It was kindness, it was care, it
was giving.

462
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,172
There's been an accident.

463
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,534
You put Samet to bed. I'll be
back soon.

464
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:24,091
He has had to much to drink.

465
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,450
What happened to the truck?

466
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:36,128
Forget the truck. Be thankful
you're alive.

467
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,295
Take care of the truck.

468
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,289
Heat some water.

469
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:47,410
And built up the fire.

470
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:01,055
- Don't you know me?.
- Of course I do.

471
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:07,250
I changed. I never drank in
those days.

472
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:29,849
What will I do now?.

473
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,417
Let's get his Jacket off.

474
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,973
He's a driver, he'd an accident.
He need rest.

475
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:47,294
Bring cotton woll and iodine.

476
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,412
If I had known who he was,
would I have brought him?.

477
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:53,972
I would, he was wounded.

478
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,258
Why did he come back?
What will, I do?.

479
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,975
Bring the water.

480
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:30,531
It's going to hurt but you
shouldn't drive when drunk.

481
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:55,295
Now sit down while I make a bed
for you.

482
01:08:56,340 --> 01:09:01,892
- I'm allright. I'll go now.
- You can't go tonight.

483
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:27,975
Who is he mummy?

484
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,289
I can't bear it.

485
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,692
- Where did you come from?
- From for away.

486
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,011
What happened, did you fight
someone?

487
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,456
- Haven't you a gun?
- I've left it home.

488
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:58,819
Will you show it to
me tomorrow?

489
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:05,820
What's your name? Are you
friend of my father?.

490
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:09,898
He's your father. A son...

491
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:13,935
Father.

492
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:19,259
Will you make up the bed for
our guest.

493
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,091
- Is he your son?
- Yes he's.

494
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,415
Your whiskers are tickling.

495
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:29,737
My son, my Little Red Scarf's
here, I can't touch them.

496
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,414
I want to cry but I musn't.

497
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,694
Leave your shirt out. Asya
will wash it.

498
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,289
Don't leave early, uncle Ilyas.

499
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,176
What am I in this house?.

500
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,539
Look in to my eyes. I've missed
you so much.

501
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:36,054
I'm afraid. I still love him.
I haven't forgetten him.

502
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:29,774
Samet is their son. Asya loves
him still.

503
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,411
If she wants to go I can't stop
them.

504
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:38,256
What was love? Who do I love?
Who cared for us?.

505
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,136
Who has the right to be the
father?.

506
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:44,218
Samet must not be unhappy.

507
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:36,375
I left everything and came back
for you two.

508
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,289
Forgive me. Hold my hand.

509
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:04,775
- How are you feeling?.
- Fine thanks.

510
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,568
There was frost last night.
You'll have to warm the motor.

511
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:11,614
- Do you think it will go?
- Will try.

512
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,253
Asya, let us know when the
water's hot.

513
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:19,737
Let's go.

514
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:53,175
- Where's uncle Ilyas?
- They've gone to the truck.

515
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,578
Take me too, mummy.

516
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:06,578
The hot water will make it work.

517
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:34,577
Uncle Ilyas, put me in the truck.

518
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:55,938
Samet, we are going home.

519
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,778
Jump in the truck and we'll go.
Samet is my son.

520
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:12,575
And you are my Little Red Scarf.

521
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:34,728
Don't forget to bring me the gun.

522
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,816
Go and play outside.

523
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,536
Here's your gun.

524
01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,935
- Like a ride?
- Yes.

525
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:06,534
Oh God, help me.

526
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:10,693
When I grow up I'll be a driver.

527
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,815
Look what uncle Ilyas brought me.

528
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,016
I said I would bring Samet a present.

529
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,531
- Stay and eat with us.
- I can't.

530
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,299
As you like.

531
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:53,412
Hands up daddy, Hands up mummy.

532
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,373
Eat your dinner.

533
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,697
Are you going to shoot someone?.
That is a shame.

534
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:07,649
Uncle Ilyas brought it. I rode
in the truck.

535
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:11,091
He's going to bring me a truck.

536
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:30,769
Eat up now

537
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:46,973
- Uncle Ilyas is here.
- You can't go out today.

538
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:52,335
- I want to see him.
- No. You're not very well.

539
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:56,337
- I'm alright.
- I said no.

540
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,090
Please don't go please...

541
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:18,335
Would she leave me?.
She's my wife.

542
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,734
How could I leave him? He's
cared for us these years.

543
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:23,369
What will we do?

544
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,049
What if he takes Samet and goes?

545
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:10,734
- But I can't ride in this.
- You can ride in my truck.

546
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:14,854
- Where is it?
- Up, on the road.

547
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:18,169
I was afraid you mother
wouldn't let you out.

548
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:24,770
She dind't want. I cried, she
cried. You look worried too.

549
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:27,569
Can ride in your truck?

550
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:45,889
You can stay with me all the
time. Well sleep in the truck.

551
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:50,652
We can drive all the time. Maybe
your mother would come O.K.

552
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,490
She still loves me. I saw it in
her eyes.

553
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,931
Faster uncle Ilyas.

554
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,493
I'm driver.

555
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:44,091
The great driver Samet is
coming, make way.

556
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:53,851
Let's take father too.

557
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,019
- Daddy.
- Stop.

558
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:08,253
Stop. I want go to my father.

559
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:11,808
- My son, look.
- I want my daddy.

560
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,459
Don't cry, I'll take you back.
Please don't cry.

561
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:41,177
I have to tell you. I'm your...
do you know.

562
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:46,329
Mummy.

563
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,456
Daddy.

564
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,336
My Red Scarf.

565
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,813
Samet has called him daddy, he
has made his choice.

566
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:05,732
What was love? it was kindness,
friend ship care.

567
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,011
If I stop now, I can never turn back.

568
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,731
I don't care as long as she smiles.

569
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:50,819
It's not wrong to fancy someone.

570
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:52,858
Will you help me get out of the
mud tomorrow?

571
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:55,373
I held his hand, it was so warm.

572
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,456
If I hold her hand will she
come with me.

573
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,933
I'm yours, all you have to do is
take me.

574
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:11,251
Goodbye Asya, goodbye my
Little Red Scarf.

575
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:18,850
My unfinished song.
