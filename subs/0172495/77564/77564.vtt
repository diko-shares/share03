00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,739
(Bell Ringing)

2
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,770
(Ringing Continues)

3
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:31,749
Ma! Mary! All ready?
First bell's a-ringin'.

4
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,944
Yes, we're all ready.

5
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,021
Mary's comin'
through the back door.

6
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,490
Now, son, cheer up.

7
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:42,993
We're all healthy,
and we've still got meal in the barrel.

8
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,030
Look at that sky.

9
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,861
Big cracks in it
like it was ice on the mill pond...

10
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,367
a-crackin' up to show us
spring's a-comin'.

11
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,133
If that ain't enough for a God-fearin',
New Hampshire family, I want to know.

12
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,900
- Oh, Jabez! Help!
- Coming!

13
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,505
- (Growling, Barking)
- Quiet, Shep! Quiet!

14
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:06,483
- Down, Shep! Down!
- He only wants you to throw
a stick for him, Jabez.

15
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,180
I guess he's feelin'
the spring air comin', too.

16
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,052
All right.

17
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,320
- Get it, Shep!
- (Barking)
- Mary? Jabez?

18
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:18,796
Comin', Ma. What's the matter?
Anything wrong with me?

19
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,423
- No, nothing.
- Then what's the smile on your face for?

20
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,799
Now, Jabez. You've got a clean shave,
and I've got on my Sunday best...

21
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,838
and I'm going to church
with my husband.

22
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,431
Almost the first time
since the beginning of winter.

23
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,010
- And if that isn't an occasion -
- I don't know what is.

24
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,011
- (Barking)
- (Squealing)

25
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:36,513
Now, what the dickens?

26
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,744
Shep! Come here, Shep!

27
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,650
- (Barking Continues)
- (Squealing Continues)

28
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,087
Shep! Shep, stop it!

29
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,961
Leave that pig alone!
Come here, Shep!

30
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:03,708
- Jabez, what's the matter?
- I don't know.
Something's wrong with the pig.

31
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,074
- Quiet, Mr. Porker.
- (Pig Shrieks)

32
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,709
He's worse than a greased pig
at the county fair.

33
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,281
Yep, his leg is broken.
Get me the box, Mary.

34
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,293
I remember Dad
used to say...

35
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,957
"When they were handing out hard luck,
the farmer got there first."

36
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,762
Now, Jabez.
Don't you remember your own wedding?

37
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,305
We said it's for better or worse.
We said it's for richer or poorer.

38
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:37,274
- That's what we said.
- Oh, your pants! They're soaked.

39
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,210
- Let me take them.
- Oh.

40
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,408
Well.

41
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:51,150
- Guess we won't be
goin' to church today.
- (Mary) I guess we won't.

42
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:55,751
Anyway, I can read you
from the Good Book.

43
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,763
There won't be
any objection to that.

44
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,095
Now you won't catch cold.

45
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,727
Ha! I call that
coddlin' a man.

46
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:09,706
Now, Ma. Seems to me you
used to do it for Dad, too.

47
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,777
Well, always did my duty.

48
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,675
Mary, hold the splint tighter.

49
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:19,784
"There was a man in the land
of Uz, whose name was Job;

50
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,911
and that man was
perfect and upright -"

51
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,751
Consarn the consarn -

52
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:29,294
Jabez! What kind of talk
is that on the Sabbath,
and me a-readin' the holy word?

53
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:34,059
Sorry, Ma. This man, Job,
he had troubles, didn't he?
Hard luck, like me.

54
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,933
Now, Jabez Stone, as for what
you're calling hard luck...

55
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,268
we made New England out of it -
that and codfish.

56
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,899
There. That'll hold him.

57
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,744
That's nice and warm for you.

58
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,682
Don't get him too close to the fire,
or we'll have roast pork for supper.

59
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,721
- Not on Sabbath you won't.
- You didn't really think
I'd forget, did you?

60
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:01,021
Give me the book, Ma.
I'm going to read us something
cheerful from the Book of Ruth.

61
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:06,190
- That is, if you don't mind
changing the lesson.
- Land sakes, I don't mind.

62
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:11,601
I never did hold much with Job,
even if he is Scripture.

63
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,036
He took on too much
to suit me.

64
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,131
'Course I don't want
to malign the man...

65
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,643
but he always sounded to me
like he come from Massachusetts.

66
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,771
Yes, Mary.
You go ahead and read.

67
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:26,045
- "And Ruth said in -"
- There's a rig turnin' into the gate!

68
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,848
- Who is it?
- It's Tom Sharp and two other fellas.

69
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,856
Well, let's, uh, let's see
what they want.

70
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,552
- Jabez!
- Oh, Glory! My pants.

71
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,787
(Knocking)

72
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,229
- Mornin', Mary.
- Mornin', Tom. Come in.

73
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:45,327
- Mornin', ma'am.
- There's a mat there
to wipe your feet on.

74
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,703
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I plumb forgot.

75
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,777
- Howdy, Jabez!
- Howdy.

76
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,278
- This is Van Brooks, Massachusetts.
- Howdy.

77
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,940
- Howdy.
- This is Eli Higgins. He's Vermont.

78
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,983
- Howdy.
- There's a mat there
to wipe your feet on.

79
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:03,112
- Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Come over to the fire. Sit down.

80
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:08,021
- Little pig hurt himself?
- Yep. Broke his leg.

81
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,291
Hmm. Too bad. Had a pig
one time broke all four legs.

82
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,491
Yep. Spoiled all the hams.

83
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,092
You may smoke on Sabbath
in Massachusetts, but not here.

84
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,229
I'm sorry, ma'am.

85
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:22,569
Rains kinda hard
in New Hampshire, don't it?

86
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,735
How's the year been
in your part of the country?

87
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,177
Well, had a good stand o' corn.

88
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,181
Comin' along right nice...

89
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,219
and then we had a hailstorm -
a hailstorm in June.

90
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,120
Hailstones so mighty,
the chickens got to settin' on 'em,
thinkin' they was eggs.

91
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,660
Yep. Makes you wonder what in tarnation
Providence was thinkin' about.

92
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:44,594
That ain't nothin'.
We had a snowstorm in August.

93
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,927
- In August?
- Yeah. Much obliged, ma'am.

94
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:50,127
It was so cold, a man got out in it,
and it froze him solid.

95
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:54,605
- All except his heart.
That was frozen already.
- Loan shark, eh?

96
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,607
Too bad it didn't happen
to Miser Stevens.

97
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,805
- Are you one of old
Stevens's customers, too?
- Sure am.

98
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,939
It's the debt and the lien
and the mortgage.

99
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,746
Quite a problem
to us farmers nowadays.

100
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,753
City folks has
their troubles, too...

101
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:12,256
but when a farmer goes bankrupt,
he can't crawl out so easy.

102
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,258
Laws oughta be
changed somehow.

103
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,624
We oughta have
more consideration.

104
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:19,493
That's the reason the three of us
met up together, Neighbor Stone.

105
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,499
Yep.

106
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,468
Farmers oughta have a sort of grange,
as they call it in Vermont.

107
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:29,507
(Tom) What do you think, Jabez?
Sound reasonable to you?

108
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:34,444
Well - Sure does,
but I'll, uh...

109
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,038
I'll have to sleep on it
a couple of nights.

110
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,016
That's fair enough.

111
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,316
Man's got a right
to mull things over.

112
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,549
Mighty fine pie
you got here, ma'am.

113
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:49,424
- Would you like another piece?
- I sure would.

114
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,693
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you.

115
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,393
Oh, Ma. I thought
we'd save that for tomorrow.

116
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,402
It's the Lord's will
to feed strangers...

117
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,563
even if they eat you
out of house and home.

118
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:06,543
Well, you read this, Jabez. We'll
drive around again in a week or so.

119
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,012
I was just thinking...

120
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,380
that, uh, they might not like the idea
down in Washington.

121
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,818
Why not? There's a bill up
in Congress now...

122
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,823
to give us
a uniform law of bankruptcy.

123
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,985
- Daniel Webster's fighting
for it right now.
- Black Daniel?

124
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,790
Yep. Biggest man
in the whole United States.

125
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,162
Senator from Massachusetts. He's gonna
be our next president, sure enough.

126
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:33,068
I know. They say when he speaks,
the stars and stripes
come right out of the sky.

127
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,072
(Whispering)
Listen, Black Daniel.

128
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:39,368
You're only wasting your time
writing speeches like that.

129
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:44,074
Why worry about the people and
their problems? Think of your own.

130
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:48,347
You want to be president of
this country, and you ought to be.

131
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:54,290
Inauguration day parade,
bands playing, prancing horses...

132
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,988
sun shining on the Stars and Stripes
waving in the breeze...

133
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,964
crowds cheering,
"Daniel Webster...

134
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,696
president of
the United States of America."

135
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,831
Don't be a fool. If you go on with
that speech, you'll never be president.

136
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,841
Be still!

137
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:22,345
"I would say to every man
who follows his own plough...

138
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:27,256
"and to every mechanic, artisan, and
laborer in every city in the country-

139
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,193
"I would say to every man,
everywhere...

140
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,993
"who wishes by honest means
to gain an honest living...

141
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,399
'Beware of wolves
in sheep's clothing."'

142
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:42,065
"The insolvent farmers cannot even
come to the seat of their government...

143
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,302
"to present their cases
to Congress...

144
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:51,179
so great is their fear that
some creditor will arrest them
in some intervening state."

145
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:55,845
"We talk much and talk warmly
of political liberty...

146
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:59,015
"but who can enjoy
political liberty...

147
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,425
if he is deprived permanently
of personal liberty?"

148
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,463
"If the final vote
shall leave...

149
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,728
"thousands of our fellow citizens and
their families in hopeless distress...

150
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,826
"can we, members
of the government...

151
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,462
"go to our beds
with a clear conscience?

152
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,134
"Can we, without self-reproach,
supplicate the Almighty Mercy...

153
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,111
to forgive our debts
as we forgive our debtors?"

154
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:25,547
- That's wonderful language
Mr. Webster uses there.
- It would move a stone.

155
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,916
If it would only move Old Miser Stevens.
We've still got to pay him.

156
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,752
- Yep. Can't get around
that mortgage. I'm sorry.
- It's all right, Sheriff.

157
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,884
I wish I could really do something
for you, but you know Stevens.

158
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:39,761
- He'll throw you off the farm
if you don't pay him tonight.
- He would!

159
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,392
The law's the law.
Good-bye. Good-bye, Mary.

160
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,437
- Bye, Sheriff.
- Bye, Sheriff.

161
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:51,602
- Well, what are we going to do?
- We've still got my butter money.

162
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,544
- Your butter money?
- Do you think I'm grudging it?

163
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,615
- Mary, it's gone.
- All of it?

164
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:02,279
All of it. I had to pay the vet
in full. He wouldn't have
treated the horse this time.

165
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,913
After all, we can't very well
do without a horse.

166
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,619
That's all right.
We'll find something to pay Stevens.

167
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,089
If the pig hadn't broken his leg,
we could have taken him.

168
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,567
Couldn't you take
a sack of seed instead?

169
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,570
To save us work
on the spring plowing?

170
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:23,005
You always said
the field uphill needs a rest.

171
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:27,045
- But if you think-
- I'm a farmer, Mary. Always will be.

172
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,343
To me, seed isn't a thing
to pay debts with.

173
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,818
It's alive - more alive
than anything.

174
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,380
But I guess you're right.
We just got to do it.

175
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:44,088
Jabez, you ought to talk to Tom Sharp
about joining the grange.

176
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:46,221
- I will, Mary.
- (Ma)Jabez.!

177
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,828
How'd you know to have
the calf ready, Ma?

178
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,530
I just figured you
didn't have any money.

179
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,199
Yes, and you figured right,
consarn it!

180
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,606
That's a word you're
too free with lately.

181
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:01,236
Consarn this
and consarn that.

182
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,316
But it helps sometimes
to say it, Ma.

183
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,011
All right, son, if it helps.

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,486
Jabez! What's this?

185
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:14,753
- Seed alone won't do it.
We'll have to throw the calf in.
- But we were countin' on it.

186
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,090
- Get up on the wagon.
- (Cow Moos)

187
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,892
- His mother's bawlin'.
- I can't help that.

188
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,092
It's such a lovely calf.

189
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:24,101
You're right, Mary.
It's a fine calf.

190
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,933
That's why old Stevens will take it
for the rest of the payment.

191
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,564
(Screams)

192
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,644
- (Groaning)
- (Barking)
- Mary! Are you hurt?

193
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,610
Ma! Quick!
Mary fell down!

194
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:38,342
- Ma.!
- Carry her into the house. Be careful.

195
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,523
No, no, no. Put her down here.
It's too cold up there.

196
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,021
Get some water, quick.

197
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,889
Quiet, Shep!
Quiet!

198
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,032
- What's ailin' that dog?
- I don't know.

199
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,337
- Well, keep him quiet.
- Let him howl if it makes him feel good.

200
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,412
- Consarn it! He's better off than I am.
- Hush up such talk!

201
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,004
I mean it, I tell you.
I've had more than my share.

202
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,447
- Nothing ever goes right for me.
- (Chickens Squawking)

203
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,078
- Now, what the dickens?
- The fox! The fox is in my henhouse!

204
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,588
Give me that gun.

205
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:31,060
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't, consarn it.
He got two of your hens.

206
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,504
Well, we'll have to do
without them. You run along,
get the seed. I'll tend to Mary.

207
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,873
(Dog Continues Barking)

208
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,712
That's enough to make a man
sell his soul to the devil!

209
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,759
- And I would for about two cents!
- (Barking Stops)

210
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:00,593
I guess nobody heard.
I hope not.

211
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,101
- (Thunder Rumbling)
- Good evening, Neighbor Stone.

212
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,073
(Livestock Shrieking)

213
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,653
- (Whistling)
- (Shrieking Fades)

214
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,964
Who are you?

215
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:35,465
My name is Scratch.

216
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,025
I often go by that name
in New England.

217
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,106
I don't have
any business with you.

218
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,675
Do you deny
that you called me?

219
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:52,683
I've known people in other states
who went back on their word, but I -

220
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,219
I didn't expect it
in New Hampshire.

221
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:58,222
You can't say that to me.
I'm New Hampshire.

222
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:01,350
And if I say I called you,
I did. Guess I did.

223
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,691
You've had a lot
of bad luck these days...

224
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,994
and yet it's all
so unnecessary...

225
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,069
(Chuckles) when I think
of your opportunities.

226
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,138
My opportunities?

227
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:17,106
- Of course. Why, man, you have one
of the richest farms in the county.
- Hmph!

228
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,177
You just go about it
the wrong way.

229
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,769
(Chuckles)
Oh, so many men do.

230
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,613
Hard work. That's all right for people
who don't know how to do anything else.

231
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,949
It's all right for people
who aren't lucky.

232
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:33,320
But once you're lucky,
you don't have to work for other people.

233
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,518
(Chuckles)
You make them work for you.

234
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,404
Why, Mister, that sounds all right.
How do I go about it?

235
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,271
Clever man like yourself,
he can find money anywhere.

236
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:54,073
Money to pay his bills,
money for his wife and children,
money enough to be a rich man.

237
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,580
All he needs is a friend
to point it out to him, like this.

238
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,024
- Isn't real. It can't be.
- Oh, no. Wait.

239
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,494
Touch it.

240
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,564
Touch it.
Feel it with your hand.

241
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,807
- (Tom)Jabez.!
- Someone's calling you, Mr. Stone.

242
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,937
- Jabez Stone!
- Oh, there he is.

243
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,948
Howdy, Jabez.

244
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,848
- Howdy, Jabez.!
- Howdy. What do you want?

245
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:38,480
We just come to ask you if you'd
made up your mind to join the grange.

246
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,686
- Grange? What grange?
- That farmers association we were
talkin' about the other day.

247
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,958
No, I don't want to join.
Go away. Leave me alone.

248
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,398
We don't mean to force you, but it's
only for your own good, neighbor.

249
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,026
- I look out for myself!
- We oughta stick together.

250
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:56,369
- Now, after Daniel Webster's speech.
- Daniel Webster can't help me.
Leave me alone.

251
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,275
Tell me, where did it come from?

252
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,408
You know the old story.

253
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,885
The Hessian wagon train that was
ambushed on its way to Saratoga.

254
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,183
Some of the gold has been
buried under your barn.

255
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,283
- Yes, why shouldn't it?
- Yes, of course.

256
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:19,694
People forgot, or the man
who knew about it died.
You know how these things happen.

257
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,962
- It's mine. It's mine.
- Yes.

258
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,503
Yes, that's right,
Mr. Stone.

259
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:31,235
Oh, uh, there is just
one little formality.

260
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:36,337
I would like
your signature... here.

261
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,507
See?

262
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,552
And when it's done,
it's done for seven years.

263
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,155
It's our usual form.

264
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:49,023
Of course, we can take up
the question of renewal in due time.

265
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,763
What does it mean here,
about my soul?

266
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:57,199
Mmm. Why should that worry you?
A soul. A soul is nothing.

267
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,601
Can you see it, smell it,
touch it? No.

268
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,937
This soul -your soul - a nothing
against seven years of good luck.

269
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,169
You'll have money
and all that money can buy.

270
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,406
(Chuckles)
Upon my word, Neighbor Stone...

271
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,780
- if it were not for my firm's
reputation in generous dealing, I -
- No! No!

272
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,944
Give it to me. I'll sign.

273
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,622
All right.

274
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:21,716
I'm afraid I'll have to...
prick your finger, Neighbor Stone.

275
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,490
- (Groans)
- But what's a little pain
to a lucky man?

276
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,766
(Chuckles)

277
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,777
Sign here.

278
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:44,246
(Thunder Booms)

279
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,374
- Afraid?
- No.

280
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,825
Excellent.

281
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,952
A firm, fair signature.

282
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:59,087
One that will last
till doomsday.

283
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,793
(Chuckles)
I congratulate you, Neighbor Stone.

284
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,369
You're going to be
the richest man in New Hampshire.

285
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,870
- Well, I'll be -
- Yes.

286
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,305
Yes. Yes, indeed.

287
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,343
But not now.

288
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,344
Not for seven years.

289
00:20:14,446 --> 00:20:17,677
(Giggling)

290
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,014
Oh, by the way,
I almost forgot.

291
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,019
- What is the date?
- April 7.

292
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,612
1840.

293
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,624
That would take us up to the...

294
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,389
seventh day of April...

295
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,623
1847.

296
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,037
Just to remind you.

297
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,368
Though, of course, we'll be
seeing each other in the interim.

298
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,169
Ah, what a beautiful sunset.

299
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:55,581
- Mary! Mary!
- Mary's all right again.
I thought you'd gone.

300
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,488
What would you do
if you had a pot of gold?

301
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,616
- Oh, Jabez.
- Mary, what would you do?

302
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,627
I don't know.

303
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:08,792
I would pay our debts,
and maybe I would buy a new bonnet.

304
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,700
- Really, I think I would
live quite the same.
- Mary...

305
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,136
look.

306
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,572
Hessian gold.
I found it in the barn.

307
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,580
- Found it in the barn, eh?
- Yes, Ma!

308
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:27,550
I was getting the seed, and I saw one of
the boards warped up, and I stumbled...

309
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,622
and - and there it was.

310
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,986
Most outlandish thing
I ever heard tell.

311
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,423
But it's true, Ma!

312
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:39,190
Here. Take 'em in your hands
and feel 'em, Ma.

313
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,596
Mary, Mary,
you feel 'em.

314
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,100
Feel 'em.
They're real, all right.

315
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,898
What's the matter?
Aren't you glad?

316
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:52,568
I don't know, Jabez,
but I'll try hard.

317
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,772
- I just can't take it all in.
- Oh, Mary.

318
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:59,942
Hessian gold.
Hmph!

319
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:03,112
Well, I hope it'll do us more good
than it did the Hessians.

320
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:08,124
Ma! We'll none of us
have to worry anymore. We're rich.

321
00:22:08,226 --> 00:22:10,251
Well, that's comforting.
Supper.

322
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,387
Mashed potatoes and milk.

323
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,624
It's not going to be mashed potatoes
and milk anymore.

324
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,065
It's gonna be turkey and oysters.
Seed corn and cattle.

325
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,364
A new bonnet for Mary,
and a new dress for Ma.

326
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,803
We're going to have the best farm
in New Hampshire...

327
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,807
and I've got it
right here in my hand.

328
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,503
That cap doesn't belong
on the table.

329
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,079
Lord, we thank thee
for this food.

330
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:33,481
Bless it to the good of our body
and help us to do thy will. Amen.

331
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:40,316
&&(Whistling)

332
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:48,059
&& (Whistling Continues)

333
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,071
Whoa.

334
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,073
& Nothing else to do
There's nothing -&&

335
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,075
- Hello, Jabez.
- Hello, Sheriff.

336
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:02,169
I was just talking to Stevens about
a little extension on your payment.

337
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,340
You didn't get it, eh? Come on.
We'll have another talk with him.

338
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,153
- (Knocking)
- Who is it?

339
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,485
Jabez Stone.

340
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,738
- Hello, Stevens.
- Stone, you're wasting
your time and mine.

341
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,138
I'm not gonna
give you an extension.

342
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,438
Well, uh -
(Clears Throat)

343
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:37,345
Now look here, Stevens.
Uh, can't we, uh, talk that over?

344
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,349
It's kinda cold here.
Why don't you make a fire?

345
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,544
I can't afford it.
Nobody's paying me these days.

346
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,553
Stone, have you got the money?

347
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:47,751
I, uh, I managed
to scrape up a bit for you.

348
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,317
- I thought if I made
kind of a part payment -
- No, Stone.

349
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,024
- In gold.
- I'd like to know where you'd get it.

350
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,032
Well, you know,
some folks are just lucky...

351
00:23:56,134 --> 00:24:00,298
and others pick it
right out of the air, like that.

352
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:04,239
Sheriff, you're a witness.
This money was paid me voluntarily.

353
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,833
While it doesn't satisfy the mortgage,
it has become my property.

354
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:10,039
Count that one, then, and that one
and that one and that one...

355
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,379
and that and that and that
and that and that.!

356
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:16,215
Sheriff, you're here to witness.

357
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,585
Well, that makes
everything clear now.

358
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,523
Come along, Sheriff.

359
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,807
Eight, nine, ten, eleven.
Eddie, that makes us all even.

360
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:49,250
Yep. It certainly was a big day
for our store. Come back again soon.

361
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:52,016
Oh, Eddie!
Here's one for you.

362
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,023
(Yelps)
Golly!

363
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:58,084
I hope I run up against a pot of
Hessian gold one day myself, Mr. Stone.

364
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,290
Jabez. Jabez, what do
you think of this?

365
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,492
Yeah, looks right elegant.

366
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,969
Newest thing by last fall catalog
in Godey's Lady's Book.

367
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,235
- Do you think it's too fancy?
- Did you say "too fancy"?

368
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,276
Lands to goodness, child.
Not for you.

369
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:16,313
Nothing's too fancy for you.
You keep it right on.

370
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,781
Well, maybe it wouldn't hurt
to have a few roses on it.

371
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:21,853
They're right pretty, Mary.

372
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:24,387
Now may I pick out
a shawl for Ma?

373
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,719
Sure. Go right ahead
and take your time.

374
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,157
I'm going over to the blacksmith shop
and pick up a new plow.

375
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,753
- I'll be back in 30 minutes.
- I'll be waiting for you.

376
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,923
- (Toots)
- Oh!

377
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,194
Eddie, where are you
going with that horn?

378
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,635
Haven't you heard, Mrs. Stone?
Daniel Webster's coming
to Cross Corners.

379
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,765
- Daniel Webster here?
- Aren't you going to the reception?

380
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,843
(Tooting)

381
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,411
Whoa.

382
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,545
Martin! Hey, Martin!
Where's the blacksmith?

383
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,312
- Playing horseshoes
with Daniel Webster!
- With who?

384
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,649
- Daniel Webster!
- Oh.

385
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,560
Crazy galoot, thinkin' he could
take on Daniel Webster.

386
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,822
Daniel pitched shoes from his cradle,
didn't you, Daniel?

387
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,367
- Yep, with my granny,
and she wasn't bad either.
- (Laughing)

388
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:14,166
Well, I really have to go now.
The people at Cross Corners
must be waiting for me.

389
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,263
It's really not very far,
Mr. Webster.

390
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,274
Oh, it's you again.
What do you want?

391
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:22,107
I thought, with the
presidential election coming up,
you might need some help.

392
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,306
I'd rather see you
on the side of the opposition.

393
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,316
Oh, I'll be there, too.

394
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,178
- That was pretty good, young man.
- Pretty good? That's perfect!

395
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,817
- Ten throws, Mr. Webster?
- All right, 10 throws it is.

396
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,953
- Let me take your coat, Mr. Webster.
- (Laughing)

397
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:44,468
(Tuba Tooting)

398
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:49,233
Friends! Neighbors! I beg of you
to have a little more patience!

399
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,310
Now, let us rehearse the parade
once more. Over here.

400
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,844
Get in line, now,
as we rehearsed.

401
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:02,415
Now, attention.!

402
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,890
- Go!
- (Drumroll)

403
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:16,193
(Cheering)

404
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:29,039
Well, ha! You win.
That calls for a drink on me.

405
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:33,243
- I really must go now. Will you
ride into the village with me?
- Oh, certainly!

406
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:35,376
Thank you, son.
Thank you.

407
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,854
(Jabez)
This is a great day for me.!

408
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,585
- Oh, Lem! Lem, will you
take care of my buggy?
- All right.!

409
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,957
- Thank you!
- All right, we're goin' to the village.

410
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:52,132
(Children Shouting)
Daniel Webster is here.!
Daniel Webster is here.!

411
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:56,071
Daniel Webster is here!
Daniel Webster is here!

412
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,233
Daniel Webster is here.!

413
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,574
(Cow Lows)

414
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,910
I guess I'm not very popular
in Cross Corners.

415
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,584
Daniel Webster's here!
Daniel Webster's here!

416
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,779
And look who's with him.

417
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,557
Well, of all the people.

418
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:18,459
- Thank you for the game.
- Welcome! Welcome to Cross Corners.

419
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,893
That's it!
That's it!

420
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,968
We are greatly honored
with your presence, and I'm-

421
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,436
- Your health, Mr. Webster.
- What about my friends?

422
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:31,305
Let's all have a drink, and a bumper one
for the champion, Jabez Stone.

423
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:33,309
Right away, sir.!
Right away.

424
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:36,505
Here's a man who knows
what's good for Daniel Webster.

425
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:38,582
Medford rum.
(Sniffing)

426
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,243
A breath
of the promised land.

427
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,652
And here's to the champion
of the iron horseshoe, Jabez Stone.

428
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,692
Thank you. Here's to the champion
of the whole United States...

429
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,421
- Daniel Webster!
- Daniel Webster!

430
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,095
- Where's the band? Where's the band?
- I don't know.

431
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,100
Oh. Go get them!
Go get them!

432
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,102
Go and get 'em?

433
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,676
What are you lookin' for, Colonel?

434
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,246
- What's your name?
- Martin Van Buren Aldrich.

435
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,009
My pa is the only Democrat
in Cross Corners.

436
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:16,611
He said you had horns and a tail,
Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.

437
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,690
You see, Martin, I only wear them
when I'm in Washington.

438
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,124
But if you ever get down there,
I'll be glad to show 'em to ya.

439
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,321
Gee, would you?
Honest?

440
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,160
Of course. And you tell
your father for me...

441
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,757
that we may be
on opposite sides of the fence...

442
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,532
but I'm always glad to hear of a man
who holds to his own opinion.

443
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,006
As long as the people do that,
this country is all right.

444
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,670
- You understand, Martin?
- Yes, sir. I guess so. Gee.

445
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,177
- Speech, Mr. Webster.
- Speech, Mr. Webster.

446
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,515
They're asking for a speech,
Mr. Webster.

447
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:53,113
A speech? Oh, no.

448
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm a little tired,
Squire Slossum.

449
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,428
- (Giggling)
- Besides, it's so pleasant here.

450
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:05,026
The sun, the air-
So pleasant in Cross Corners.

451
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,661
- But, Mr. Webster.
- You talk.

452
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,705
Listen, folks.

453
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,745
Well, I don't know much
about "speechifying"...

454
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,144
but I feel it my duty to -

455
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:21,416
- What's the matter with him?
Cat got his tongue?
- Hush up, Sarah.

456
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,752
Well, folks, what I want to say is,
when a man like Daniel Webster
visits us...

457
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,758
we shouldn't ask him
for a speech.

458
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,091
It's for us to speak, to tell him that
we farmers thank our lucky stars...

459
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:34,097
every day in the year
for what he's done for us.

460
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,532
If anybody's gonna have
corn in his crib, or hay in his barn...

461
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:40,832
it'll all be due to our good friend
and neighbor, Daniel Webster...

462
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:45,376
who stood right up in Congress
to protect us from loan sharks
by a new law.

463
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:50,379
After hard work like that,
well, it's only natural that
Daniel Webster gets tired.

464
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,315
He's tired of makin' speeches. He just
wants a little rest in the sunshine.

465
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:59,584
And, folks, ifhe chooses Cross Corners'
sunshine to rest in, that's mighty fine.

466
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,057
And I want to say this
before I quit talkin;

467
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:06,426
We'll be hoein' corn, all due,
like I says, to our good neighbor,
Daniel Webster.

468
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:10,126
And we'll keep on hoeing corn
until he's in the White House
in Washington where he belongs!

469
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:14,604
Hooray! Hooray!

470
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,333
Hooray! Hooray!

471
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:21,777
Hooray! Hooray!

472
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,576
An eloquent speech,
Neighbor Stone.

473
00:31:24,682 --> 00:31:28,448
I couldn't have done better myself,
under the circumstances.

474
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,215
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Thank you.

475
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,347
I'd like for you to meet
my wife, Mary.

476
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:36,450
- Well, if it isn't little
Mary Simpson from Franklin.
- It is.

477
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,893
You've got a smart man.
Hang on to him.

478
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,956
- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
- That's just fine.

479
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,433
Well, I have to be getting on
to Franklin before night.

480
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,630
- Good-bye, Mary.
Remember me to your mother.
- Thank you, Mr. Webster.

481
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,675
- Good-bye, Jabez. God bless you both.
- Good-bye. Thank you.

482
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:55,007
- Good-bye, Squire. Good-bye, everybody!
- Good-bye.

483
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:01,718
(Shouting, Cheering)

484
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,451
Remember, Mary,
how he said it?

485
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,529
"Couldn't have done better myself,
Jabez Stone."

486
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,394
(Snickers)
It was my first speech.

487
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,399
I don't know
what happened to me.

488
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:54,198
I just stood up, and the words came
flowing like water out of my mouth.

489
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,435
Yes, Jabez,
it was a wonderful day...

490
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,909
but I'm glad to be home again.

491
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:04,743
- Tired?
- Well -

492
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:08,046
- Well, what is it?
- I'm a little worried.

493
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,178
There's nothing
to worry about now.

494
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,258
- Jabez, I -
- Mary, you just wait and see.

495
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,259
This is just
the beginning-

496
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,057
just the beginning
of everything.

497
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,098
I'm going to be the biggest man
in New Hampshire...

498
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,259
and you're going to be the wife
of the biggest man.

499
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,633
(Dog Barking)

500
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,608
(Barking)

501
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:35,611
Quiet, Shep!

502
00:33:35,713 --> 00:33:37,681
Don't take cold, Jabez.

503
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,649
- There's a new moon, Mary.
- Yes, I know, Jabez.

504
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,386
There's hope and promise in it.

505
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:54,761
Planting and promise
of a good harvest to come.

506
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,837
- What is it?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

507
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,351
(Barking)

508
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,855
(Horn Blows)

509
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,169
Lord, we thank thee
for this food.

510
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:12,868
Bless it to the good of our body
and help us to do thy will. Amen.

511
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,683
Now, look here, son.

512
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,686
I'm glad to see a Stone
come up in the world again...

513
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,552
- but things that grow
too fast will never-
- You look here, Ma.

514
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,750
I'm not a boy anymore,
and I want that understood.

515
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,761
I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer
the rest of my life.

516
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:34,593
Jabez, once you said
we'd never change.

517
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:38,760
Never mind what I said once.
Listen to what I say now.
I've made up my mind.

518
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:42,465
(Barking)

519
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,881
Was that my son talking?

520
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,919
But what's a farmer to do, if-

521
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,989
if he don't want to get roped in more
by them loan sharks?

522
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,854
You don't have to go
to Miser Stevens while I'm around.

523
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,859
- Don't I?
- Nah.

524
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,020
Say, that's mighty white of you.

525
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,257
Not at all, Hank.
I'm glad to help ya.

526
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:11,096
Thank you, Jabez.
I really wouldn't need very much.

527
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:15,696
If you could just let me have
some seed to start off with -
enough for spring plantin'.

528
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,765
Seed? Easiest thing
in the world. Come along.
Pick out everything you need.

529
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:24,041
- Sure you can spare it?
- Sure. I just bought some seed.

530
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:27,242
- Say, about the interest -
- Don't you worry about that.

531
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,184
Leave it all to me.
We won't talk business today.

532
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,279
You just bear this in mind:

533
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,622
I am not a man to get rich on
other people's hard luck. Nope, not me.

534
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:39,127
Say, that's mighty fine
of you, Jabez.

535
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,563
I've been through the mill myself,
and I know just how you feel.

536
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:51,003
Here. The best seed you'll find
in all New Hampshire.

537
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:20,996
- Asleep, Ma.
- That's good. Sit down.

538
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,067
I feel fidgety, Ma.

539
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,433
Not right.
Not right at all.

540
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:32,976
Lands! I'd think you were gonna have
the baby, to hear ya.

541
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,672
- Sit down. You make me nervous.
- (Groans)

542
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,147
The way a man always is.

543
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,583
Thinks his son is the
most important thing in the world.

544
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,625
- Say that again, Ma.
- Oh! Made me stick my finger.

545
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,021
A son.
Do you really think so, Ma?

546
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:58,363
Oh, get along with ya.
As if it matters to a grandma.

547
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,733
Perhaps you have
an even chance.

548
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,536
(Wind Whistling)

549
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,347
Queer sort of weather
we're having.

550
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,450
Weird, like everything else.

551
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:18,079
Thank God you can always depend
on New England for weather.

552
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,090
We've got enough
for the whole United States.

553
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,921
(Whispers)
A son.

554
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,998
An heir.

555
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,930
Money.

556
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,842
Money is a funny thing,
ain't it, Ma?

557
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:50,751
I figure it depends a might on how
you get it and how you spend it.

558
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:54,916
- But I don't spend any.
- But you should, son.
That's all it's good for.

559
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,353
Do you really think that?

560
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,828
That's just common sense.

561
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,195
Now, a man like
Daniel Webster.

562
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,235
Guess they pay him high
for what he does...

563
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,999
but he's worth it,
and he helps others.

564
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:11,597
Makes all the difference.

565
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,007
I know.

566
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:17,274
But suppose a man
got his money in bad ways?

567
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,872
Wouldn't profit him none.

568
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,714
You see, son,
I'm old, and I've lived.

569
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,120
When a man gets
his money in bad ways...

570
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:31,126
when he sees the better course
and takes the worse...

571
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:36,495
then the devil's in his heart,
and that fixes him.

572
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,161
And yet, a man could change
all that, couldn't he?

573
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,297
A man can always change things.

574
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:46,740
That's what makes him different
from the barnyard critters.

575
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,577
Where ya goin; son?

576
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:24,708
(Laughing)

577
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,686
(Cackles)
Oh, come, come, Neighbor Stone.

578
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,687
No need to get so excited.

579
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,555
I wouldn't try to cut
that tree down, if I were you.
It means a breach of contract.

580
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,388
I don't care!

581
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,794
But you should, now that
you're becoming a father.

582
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,799
You keep your tongue off that!

583
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,302
Yes, of course. Certainly.
I shan't even come to christening.

584
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,567
It would be tactless
and in wretched bad taste.

585
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,906
But I may send a friend of mine,
just for old times' sake.

586
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,742
- Yes, I think I'll do that.
- (Ma)Jabez.!

587
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,908
Get away! Get away! Get outta here.
Quick! Hurry! Get away!

588
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,009
Your mother.
I find her rather difficult.

589
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,317
Hardly the type
for my sort of thing.

590
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:08,948
- Jabez.!
- Bye, Mr. Stone.

591
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,295
Jabez.!

592
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,992
Here you are, son. I was worried
about you. Look at that hail.

593
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,095
The crops will be ruined!

594
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,334
- It don't matter.
- What's that you say?

595
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:29,344
- I say it don't matter.
- Now, that's the way to talk.

596
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:33,177
I know you've worked hard
for this crop, but we'll make out.

597
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,310
Make out?
We'll do better than that.

598
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,356
I never thought
I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am.

599
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:45,394
I never thought I'd be glad of
a hailstorm at harvesttime, but I am.

600
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:49,330
I'm glad of the rain,
the storm and the hail.

601
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,876
(Sobs)

602
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,642
What's the matter?
What are you crying about?

603
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,809
Ruined.
All the fields ruined.

604
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,582
(Jabez) Yes, it's terrible
what the hail has done to the fields...

605
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,681
but not to my fields.

606
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:18,990
Look, Mary.! It didn't touch any
of my wheat.! I'll have a rich harvest.!

607
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,088
Hello, Lem, Hank.

608
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:26,158
(Cackling)

609
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,735
You'd think that Stone was standing
good with Providence somehow.

610
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:37,678
My wheat's no more use
than a last year's crow's nest.

611
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,976
Maybe you'll let me
help you out a bit.

612
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,350
Seems like someone's
giving us the horselaugh.

613
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:47,390
I guess you're ripe and ready now
to join our grange, eh?

614
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,721
Wait a minute! I can make you
some better terms.

615
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,695
- Hi, boys!
- Howdy.!

616
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,856
Did ya ever see such hail?
Big as bowling balls out our way.

617
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,400
Broke all the windows
and nearly killed the cat.

618
00:43:58,502 --> 00:44:00,868
I'll take cider... hard.

619
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,905
(Scratch)
Boys...

620
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,373
- I'm here with an offer
from Jabez Stone.
- What's that?

621
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,637
Well, seein' as how,
due to yesterday's hail...

622
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,305
nobody's got nothing
to harvest in his own field...

623
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:14,214
Jabez thought maybe you might
help him harvest his.

624
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,250
Never worked for anybody else
in my whole life...

625
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:25,428
'cept when I was a shaver...

626
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,656
and that was for my old man.

627
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:31,292
- I wouldn't do it.
- Well, I don't know.

628
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:34,371
- I'll think it over.
- What's there to think about?

629
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,929
Here's a dollar in advance for everyone
who will work forJabez Stone.

630
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:49,653
& Come, ye thankful people, come &

631
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:55,658
&Raise the song
ofharvest home &

632
00:44:55,759 --> 00:45:01,220
&All is safely gathered in &

633
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:07,236
&Ere the winter storms begin &&

634
00:45:08,972 --> 00:45:12,237
- && (Music Playing)
- (Man Calling Dance)

635
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,423
Hurry up. Hurry up.

636
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,893
Ma, how is she?

637
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,260
You'll be a father
any minute now.

638
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,424
Golly, Ma!

639
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:41,334
Consarn that music. Shouldn't have
had the harvest dance tonight.

640
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,736
Fiddlesticks.
She don't hear.

641
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,309
She's got better music
than that to listen to.

642
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,401
(Baby Cries)

643
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,912
There. That's what I mean.

644
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,940
(Crying Continues)

645
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,555
Jabez.

646
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:12,034
Here's your son.

647
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,070
Howdy, son.

648
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,800
- I told you you had an even chance.
- (Giggles)

649
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:21,241
- Anything else, Doctor?
- No, just keep her warm.

650
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,677
Be careful, Jabez.

651
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,681
- Dorothy.
- Yes, ma'am.

652
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,683
- Fetch a hot brick.
- Right, ma'am.

653
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,879
Look here, everybody!
My son!

654
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:35,356
- Hey, it's a boy!
- Hooray forJabez Stone!

655
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:38,553
- Hooray! Hooray!
- Hooray forJabez Stone!

656
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:42,531
That's enough.
Want him to catch a death of cold?

657
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,364
Don't be cross with him, Ma.
This doesn't happen every day.

658
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:49,766
Here.

659
00:46:49,873 --> 00:46:52,774
- Jabez, I have a wish.
- Yes, Mary, what is it?

660
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:54,776
I want to name him Daniel.

661
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,778
After Daniel Webster?

662
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,780
Yes. I wrote
to Mr. Webster...

663
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,851
and asked him to be
the godfather of our first baby.

664
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:05,581
- You don't mind, do you?
- No, I don't mind.

665
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:08,180
Why, lands! What's the matter
with you, Jabez?

666
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,386
I should think you'd be flattered
to have Daniel Webster as a godfather.

667
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,225
- Now, go down and see
what's keeping Dorothy.
- Sure, Ma.

668
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:17,960
- Oh! Thanks very much, Doc.
Thanks for everything.
- It's all right, Jabez.

669
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,403
Hurry up, Dorothy.
What's the matter with the brick?

670
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,406
Mary needs it.

671
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:32,115
- You're not Dorothy.
- No. She's gone.

672
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:37,520
- She couldn't be gone.
- But she is.

673
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:39,589
I have taken her place.

674
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,926
Don't you remember?

675
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,286
You wrote me a letter.

676
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,336
- Looks like my writing.
- It is.

677
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,799
(Laughs)

678
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:05,682
I have other recommendations, too...

679
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:09,650
from a very dear friend of yours.

680
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,722
Never mind.
What's your name?

681
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,690
Belle.

682
00:48:15,792 --> 00:48:19,125
- Belle?
- Belle Dee.

683
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:23,131
Belle Dee?
Where are you from?

684
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,224
From over the mountain.

685
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,830
From over the mountain.

686
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,603
(Ma)
Jabez?

687
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,113
No, that's for me to do.

688
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,308
- Night, Ma Stone.
- Good night, Dr. Simpson.

689
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,891
Who's she?

690
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:54,487
Dorothy?

691
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,566
No, it's me.

692
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,795
And this will keep you warm,
Mrs. Stone.

693
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,237
You're not resting well.

694
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:16,111
Oh, I know.
It's that music.

695
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,314
You need your sleep.

696
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,891
Is there anything else
you want, Mrs. Stone?

697
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,728
- What's your name?
- Belle.

698
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,805
Thank you, Belle.

699
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,217
What a nice and kind girl.

700
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,187
- Who is she?
- The new maid, Jabez says.

701
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,952
But I don't like her, and I don't
think we ought to keep her on.

702
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,959
That's forJabez to decide.

703
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,461
He's the head of the family.

704
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:05,592
- You all signed?
- Yeah, we all signed.

705
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,034
That's fine.
Leave all your worries to me.

706
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,038
- Have a cigar.
- Ah, thanks.

707
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,540
- Go on inside and have a good time.
- Sure. Why not?

Your conscience bothering you?

Ha! We take care of that.
Give me your hand.

736

Faster! Faster!

Golly, Belle,
this is wonderful.

738
00:53:16,993 --> 00:53:19,223
You know, we should
go sleigh riding every Sunday.

739
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:22,662
- Why not every day?
- I can't. I got too much work to do.

740
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,758
- Others can do it for you.
- That's an idea.

741
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,136
Hey!

742
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:33,175
Hey, you! You can't fish there!
That's private property!

743

I'm Jabez Stone!
I'll have the sheriff after you!

Golly, it's fun to scare people
and watch 'em run. Hey.

746
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,749
Look. He caught
some nice ones.

747
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,725
- Well, let's have them for breakfast.
- All right.

749
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,301
Mornin', Mary!
Brought you some fish.

750
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,302
I want you to cook them
for breakfast.

751
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,737
- But, Jabez, it's Sabbath.
I'm going to church with Ma.
- (Bell Ringing)

752
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:07,503
- Please, won't you come with us?
- I want you to fix the fish.

753
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,511
Oh, no, she won't.

754
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:12,878
I'll not have the scorn of God in this
house with the smell of fish in it...

755
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,918
- polluting up the Sabbath.
- (Groans)

756
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,385
And as for you, let me tell you,
young woman.

757
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,513
If you think
you're running this house...

758
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:23,184
because Mary hasn't put you
in your place, you're mistaken.

759
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,853
- But, Ma -
- Don't you "Ma" me!

760
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:29,159
- Let's go, Mary.
The second bell's ringing.
- Comin', Ma.

761
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,757
Good-bye, little Daniel.
Take good care of him, Belle.

762
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,995
I certainly will, Mrs. Stone.

763
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,007
Jabez, you're sure
you won't come with us?

764
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,542
I'll cook the fish myself.

765
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:53,819
It seems a little hard
for your mother to get used to me...

766
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:58,417
but I'm quite sure
she will, in time.

767
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,758

like 'em best?

Who did that?

770
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:22,317
The fella I caught fishing
in my lake.

771
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,546
- I'll get him yet.
- (Sleigh Bells Jingling)

772
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,782
- Your friends are coming.
- Well, let's get ready.

773
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,186
Here we are. Hurry, Belle.
Get the drinks.

774
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,287
- Morning, Jabez.
- Ah, morning, Squire.

775
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:37,457
- How are you, Jabez?
- Hiya, fellas.

776
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,967
- And how's little Daniel today?
- By the way, Jabez...

777
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,562
did you know that Daniel Webster
was up in Franklin last week?

778
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,198
- Without stopping at Cross Corners?
- That's never happened before.

779
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,277
- I hope he has no grudge against us.
- Oh, no.

780
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,778
I had a letter from him
the other day. A nice one.

781
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,780
I offered to lend him money
for his campaign...

782
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:54,782
but he thanked me
and said he didn't need any.

783
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:57,216
- You offered money to Daniel Webster?
- Sure. I got enough.

784
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,220
You never know.
He might be president one day.

785
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:01,722
Gentlemen, what's the game?
Same limit as last Sunday?

786
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,589
- Well, I, uh -
- Ah, you'll have
better luck today, Squire.

787
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,595
- Before I forget it,
here's the money I owe you.
- Oh, thanks, Squire.

788
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,756
(Jabez)
Cards, gentlemen.

789
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,460

&& (Humming)

796
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:56,042
And it is this kind of men
of whom the Bible says...

797
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:00,480
"Either make the tree good
and his fruit good...

798
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,576
"or else make the tree corrupt
and his fruit corrupt...

799
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:07,656
for the tree
is known by his fruit."

800
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:10,555
And now, let us pray.

801
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:17,461
Almighty God, who has given us
this good land for our heritage...

802
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:21,128
save us from discord
and confusion...

803
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,398
and pride and arrogancy...

804
00:57:23,506 --> 00:57:25,736
and from every evil way.

805

- Oh, Lord, hide not thy face from me...

when I am in trouble.

807
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,607
Incline thy ear unto me.

808
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:37,753
Cast out the evil spirit...

809
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:41,950
and lead Jabez
back into thy kingdom.

810
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,583
- Amen.
- Amen.

811
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:47,162
- && (Singing In French)
- I bet $50.

812
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,163
- I'm out.
- I call ya.

813
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,166
- Three aces. I win.
- Well, you win!

814
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,396
- You know, the sheriff s
lucky for a beginner.
- You French?

815
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:58,440
No. I'm not anything.

816
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,441
- On with the game, Squire.
- (Laughing)

817
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,977
- (Church Bell Ringing)
- That's all for today.
You'll have to go.

818
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,047
Next time, as usual.

819
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,912
- (Bell Continues)
- Good-bye, Jabez.

820
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:10,247
(Squire)
I'll see you next week.

821
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:13,811
- (Jabez) Better luck
next time, Squire.
- Oh, just a losing streak.

822
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:19,722
You better be careful, Jabez. People
are talking about you in the village.

823
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,854
The village. Hmph!

824
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,593
(Man) It's like the Old Nick
has got into him.

825
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:29,263
Gettin'worse every year.
The more he gets, seems more he wants.

826
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,340
(Tom)
The deal he made with Hank.

827
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,342
He used it as bait
for the rest ofhis neighbor folk...

828
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,412
to make them slave for him, too.

829
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,277
At first it seemed like
out of the goodness of his heart.

830
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:41,282
Now I know different.

831
00:58:41,384 --> 00:58:44,285
I used to think Miser Stevens
was an ornery cuss.

832
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:47,379
He'd pinch a cent
till the eagle squeals.

833
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:52,052
But now I'm thinkin' he ain't
so all-fire bad, compared with Jabez.

834
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:54,823
Every year he builds a new barn,
and now look at him.

835
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:57,491
Buyin' machinery and hirin'
other folks to work for him.

836
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,091
He don't do nothin'
but gamble and tend his horses.

837
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,763
That Hessian gold.
You can blame it all on that.

838
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,808
That girl he's taken on as nurse
for the boy, or so he says...

839
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,310
but anybody knows
who she is.

840
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:13,473
It's a miracle his wife is standin'
for that sort of thing all these years.

841
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,551
You know what
a fine woman she is.

842
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,746
A man likeJabez could do
so much good with his money.

843
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,915
A strange sickness
seems to have come over him.

844
00:59:22,025 --> 00:59:25,392
A plague, sorta.
Like the Bible tells about.

845
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:28,621
Look at the mansion he built.

846
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,699
- Granny!
- What is it?

847
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,709
When are we going
to move to the new house?

848
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:43,802
Oh, we ain't a-gonna move.

849
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,847
The old one's good enough for us.

850
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,883
But I like the new one better.

851
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:50,953
(Chuckles) Well.
It's just too bad for you, Daniel.

852
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,950
- Strawberries.
- Don't grab!

853
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:57,549
Children ask for things.
At least good children do.

854
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:00,925
- Go and help your mother.
- (Chicken Squawking)

855
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,828
Now, lands to goodness.
What's happened to that old hen?

856
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:06,766
Daniel, did you use
that slingshot again?

857
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:09,235
- I did not, Granny.
- Oh, yes, you did, Daniel.

858
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:11,466
I saw it from the window,
and then to lie about it.

859
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,804
Give me that slingshot, Daniel.

860
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:17,971
It's mine, Ma. Pa made it for me,
and I'm not gonna give it to anybody!

861
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,448
- Daniel, give me that slingshot!
- No, I won't!

862
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:25,979
- No, no, no! No!
- Oh!

863
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,856
Daniel! I've stood
as much as I can bear.

864
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:36,557
- Come along.
- (Daniel Crying)

865
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,032
(Jabez) Hey.! What's going on here?
What happened?

866
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,195
- Where are you taking him?
Oh, no, you won't!
- I'm going to lock him up.

867
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,364
And why not?
I'm his mother.

868
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,442
And I'm his father.

869
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,737
You're not supposed
to punish my son.

870
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,577
Now, it's all right, Daniel.

871
01:00:53,683 --> 01:00:55,913
- What did he do?
- He lied to me again.

872
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,182
- I did not!
- He never lies to me.

873
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:03,725
(Belle) Now, come along,
and we'll put on a nice red coat.

874
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,920
- Shall we?
- (Daniel) Oh, yes!

875
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:13,497
Jabez, how can you let her
talk like that when the boy's present?

876
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:15,503
Oh.

877
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:18,540
- He won't respect me anymore.
- Isn't that your own fault?

878
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,939
My fault?

879
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:23,945
Oh, Jabez, all I want
is to be proud of him.

880
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:27,312
He could be such a fine boy,
if only we show him how to be.

881
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:30,113
He's my son,
and I like him the way he is.

882
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,052
Why do you always pick on the boy?
If it's not him, it's me.

883
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:36,125
You don't like the way I live,
my new friends, the house or anything.

884
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:39,456
- But I never said that.
- You don't have to.
It shows in your face.

885
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:46,633
Jabez, I am worried
about the way you've changed.

886
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,728
That was something you said
you'd never do. Remember?

887
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,808
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Leave me alone.

888
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:58,113
- I'm all ready!
- Ah, that's fine, son. Come on.

889
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:01,945
- We're gonna go fox hunting.
Up in the upper pasture. Huh?
- Hooray!

890
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,452
- Granny, look at me.!
- I see ya.

891
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,989
Bye, Granny.
Bye, Mom.

892
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,060
(Barking)

893
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:19,591
Fox hunting? A Stone
going fox hunting on a weekday.

894
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,735
And the earth crying out
for the need of him.

895
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,174
Now, Ma, you just try to keep hold of
yourself and set a good example for me.

896
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:31,644
Me? Why, look here,
Mary Stone.

897
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,648
- I'm worried about you.
- Worried about me?

898
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,382
Well, you can just stop.

899
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:44,392
- What's that?
- I said you should just stop worrying.

900
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,730
Because I've made up my mind.

901
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,624
Hey there,
Black Daniel!

902
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:54,601
- Hello!
- Someone to see you, Daniel!

903
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:57,605
(Daniel) If it's the British minister,
take him around to the pantry.

904
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,902
Give him a drink.
Tell him to wait.

905
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:01,909
Just someone
from New Hampshire!

906
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:05,674
Oh, that's different.
Well, boys, I gotta see a friend.

907
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,010
- Mary, do you mind if I indulge?
- Oh, of course not.

908
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,053
No, you wouldn't.

909
01:03:12,155 --> 01:03:16,148
You're not the kind of a woman
who is afraid of smoke or fire.

910
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:22,158
Now, let's talk about your affairs.

911
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:26,167
Oh, goodness, Mr. Webster.
I've done nothing but talk
about that all through dinner.

912
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:29,602
Yes, you've been chatting a lot,
but womanlike.

913
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:32,367
Nibbling around the edges.

914
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,638
But you'll forgive
an old lawyer's legal mind.

915
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:39,146
I don't think you ever once
came to the point.

916
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:42,342
And there is a point,
isn't there?

917
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:47,514
Why, yes. It's -
It's hard to put into words.

918
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:49,989
There's the matter
of little Daniel's schooling...

919
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,322
and the new house.

920
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,794
And there's something else
that's wrong.

921
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,595
It gets worse year after year.

922
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,602
It's like a shadow growing.

923
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,567
I-I can't really talk about it,
even to Ma.

924
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,769
She puts it all on Jabez,
and I won't stand for that.

925
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:12,871
I've heard a lot of odd things
aboutJabez.

926
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:16,213
Seems he's not making
the right kind of name for himself.

927
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:18,719
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe
all that people say.

928
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:22,279
Oh, you don't have to defend him to me.
I've been called names myself.

929
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:27,627
You see, all I care about is Jabez.

930
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,826
He was the first man I loved.

931
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,803
He never used to care
about money.

932
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:39,966
We -We were poor as Job's turkey,
and none of us minded.

933
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:44,604
Now I've seen him drive
the poor from the door,
and we used to be poor ourselves.

934
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:48,480
I-I've seen him hard and mean,
and he isn't hard or mean.

935
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:52,213
I've heard him mock at
the church bells - the bells
that rang at our wedding.

936
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:57,520
All that isn't like him, Mr. Webster.
It must be my fault somehow, my fault.

937
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,396
You know, Mary...

938
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:06,093
you've talked to me as you might
have talked to your father...

939
01:05:06,202 --> 01:05:08,762
and I think he wants me
to help you a little.

940
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:13,240
We sometimes feel
that we're licked in this life.

941
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,708
We weren't put here
to be licked.

942
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:17,711
Don't you believe it.

943
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,941
We sometimes feel the shadows
have got hold of us -

944
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,950
the shadows of evil.

945
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:26,881
But still,
it's up to us to fight.

946
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:30,083
You know, I was planning,
just before you came...

947
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,854
to make a little trip
over to Cross Corners...

948
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:36,261
and to get acquainted with
that godson of mine and other things.

949
01:05:36,365 --> 01:05:38,390
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster?

950
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:45,104
Yeah. Yeah, not bad.

951
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,843
Not bad at all.

952
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,142
Looks all right, eh, Belle? It'll give
the folks something to talk about.

953
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:54,648
- Now, the people, Jabez. The people.
- Ah, folks or people.

954
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:56,741
What's the difference
among friends? Hey!

955
01:05:56,852 --> 01:05:59,412
- Don't tear it down again.
You have to do that?
- Well, uh -

956
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:01,422
I'm sorry, sir,
but that's part of the fitting.

957
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,152
Well, as long as you have it
ready for the party.

958
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,357
- Good morning, Squire Slossum.
- Good morning, Belle.

959
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,955
- May I have your hat?
- Oh, how do you do, Squire?

960
01:06:11,067 --> 01:06:13,467
- Jabez.
- Feel that material.

961
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:16,163
Hey, you! Look out there.
You're scuffin' my carpet.

962
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:19,241
- Those things cost money.
- Won't you sit down?

963
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:22,709
Thank you. Uh, I'm rather pressed
for time, but it's very kind.

964
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,905
Get some wine
for the squire, Belle.

965
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:27,482
Well, very elegant home
you have here, Jabez.

966
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,177
- You really think so?
- Yes, but you wanted
to discuss something.

967
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,618
- Some business, I believe.
- Yes, yes. Won't take a minute.

968
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,723
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.

969
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,884
- Daniel Webster's coming to my party.
- Daniel Webster?

970
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,087
Yes. That's the reason
I wanted to talk to you.

971
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:42,460
Here's a list of the people
I've invited. Look 'em over.

972
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:44,863
No, no, no. Champagne for the squire,
Belle. Champagne.

973
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,128
- All right.
- Well, what do you say?

974
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:50,296
They all the right kind of people,
or did I miss anybody?

975
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,931
Well, the only person
you've missed is the president.

976
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,806
You think that's a joke.
I had him on that, too.

977
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,970
Only I was afraid Webster
might feel insulted.

978
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,980
No, you keep that.
That's for you.

979
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:04,041
I want you to talk up
the party and to make sure
that the best folks really come.

980
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,713
- You mean you want me to go around and -
- Yes, sirree.

981
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:11,384
That's the idea. You can
tell 'em all about the house,
but don't mention Webster.

982
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,962
We'll get them all here,
and then I'll say...

983
01:07:14,063 --> 01:07:17,396
"Look here, folks. Here's
Daniel Webster, my guest of honor."

984
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,866
Golly, I can see their eyes
pop out right now.

985
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:23,097
- Are you sure he'll come?
- Of course I am!

986
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,139
- Want to bet?
- Why not?

987
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,870
- How much?
- Five thousand. Exactly what I owe you.

988
01:07:28,978 --> 01:07:30,707
(All Laughing)

989
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:38,686
Hello there, Colonel.
Do you want a lift? Ho!

990
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:42,349
Well, I wouldn't mind.
My name's Daniel Stone.

991
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:44,358
Not the son
ofJabez Stone.

992
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,894
- Yes, sir.
- Ha. Well, this is an occasion.

993
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,430
Come on. Giddyap, George.
Come on, Jeb. (Makes Kissing Sound)

994
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:52,591
Gee, that fair.

995
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:56,364
- It hasn't opened yet.
- No, but I can hardly wait.

996
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:59,839
Mister, tell me. Will there really be
a man that eats fire?

997
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:03,105
I guess there will be,
if it says so.

998
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:08,946
An-An-And "two unparalleled
Circassian beauties"?

999
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:12,851
- What is that?
- Young man, you've got me there.

1000
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:15,355
Mmm. Daniel Webster
will be there, too.

1001
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,824
Mmm. A list
of varied attractions.

1002
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,361
Which one would you
like to see first?

1003
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,897
I think I'd like to begin
with the fire-eater.

1004
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:25,091
Well, what about
Daniel Webster?

1005
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:28,659
- I'll see him last.
- And it'd serve him right.

1006
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,739
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1007
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,974
Don't - Don't let me ever catch you
doing that again.

1008
01:08:35,077 --> 01:08:39,343
- Why, it don't hurt.
- Yes, it does hurt,
and don't do it again.

1009
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,178
- You make 'em go faster.
- No, Daniel.

1010
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:45,811
They're not racehorses.
They're two good, old friends of mine.

1011
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,549
I call them Constitution
and the Bill of Rights.

1012
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:51,922
Most dependable team
for long journeys.

1013
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:56,123
Then I've got another one
called Missouri Compromise.

1014
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:58,166
And a Supreme Court...

1015
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:03,170
a fine, dignified horse, though you
have to push him on every now and then.

1016
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:05,797
Golly! I'd like to see
all your horses.

1017
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,808
Mmm. Maybe you can sometime.

1018
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:11,437
I'm a farmer you know,
and I love to show my farm.

1019
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:15,415
But the thing I'd like to show you most,
you'll have to see for yourself.

1020
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:17,645
What's that, sir?

1021
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,154
Well, it's high
and it's wide...

1022
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:24,158
and it goes a long ways.

1023
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,990
There's a wind blowing through it...

1024
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:29,860
and it has a blue roof over it.

1025
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:34,834
It's the hills and the rivers
flowing to the south...

1026
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:37,701
and the new states
growing in the west.

1027
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:41,902
- Anybody can see that.
- No, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Stone.

1028
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:45,503
Some people live and die
without ever seeing it.

1029
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:48,879
They can't see the country
for the money in their pockets.

1030
01:09:48,984 --> 01:09:52,818
They think their state is the country
or the way they live is the country...

1031
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,358
and they're willing
to split the country because of it!

1032
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:59,655
Well, I hope you'll meet them all
when you've grown up.

1033
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,856
You'll meet the fire-eaters
and the Circassian beauties.

1034
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:05,160
They are part of the fair,
to be sure.

1035
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,566
But if we had to depend upon them
in a permanent sort of way...

1036
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:11,469
this country would have stopped
at the Allegheny Mountains.

1037
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:14,509
But it didn't stop.
I know it didn't stop.

1038
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:18,307
- Granny told me it didn't.
- Ha. No, sirree, it didn't.

1039
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,644
And it won't,
no matter what happens...

1040
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:24,651
as long as the people at the fair
believe in freedom and union.

1041
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:28,553
Well, giddyap, Constitution.
We got to be getting on, Mr. Stone.

1042
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,591
- Faster, faster!
- Oh! Oh!

1043
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,493
Whoa.! Ho.! Ho.!

1044
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:42,464
Young man, I think
you've got this coming to you!

1045
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,096
- Didn't I tell you not to do that again?
- (Crying)

1046
01:10:45,207 --> 01:10:47,767
- Hello, Daniel Webster.
- How are you?

1047
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:50,902
- Hello, Black Daniel.
- (People Chattering)

1048
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:55,211
- Are you Mr. Webster?
- Yes, I'm Mr. Webster, your godfather.

1049
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,285
Now, you run along
and behave yourself.

1050
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:00,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Webster.
(Whimpers)

1051
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:04,286
I expected to see all you folks
over atJabez Stone's
for the housewarming party.

1052
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:09,194
- I hope you didn't wait for me
to lead the parade.
- Well, not exactly, Mr. Webster.

1053
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:13,600
We wanted to have a chat with you
before we go to the party.

1054
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:15,567
Would you mind
having a drink with us?

1055
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,662
Would I mind having a drink
with you gentlemen?

1056
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:19,707
What a question
to ask Daniel Webster.

1057
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:22,072
(All Laughing)

1058
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:25,543
Ma. I'm leaving.

1059
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:28,082
So you made up your mind
to go to his party.

1060
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:31,744
- You're not angry with me, are you?
- Aw, fiddlesticks!

1061
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:35,381
I might have done the same thing
if it had been my husband...

1062
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,516
only I'd take the whip along.

1063
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,527
Be sure to let me know
if Daniel's there.

1064
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,603
I won't forget.

1065
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,730
&&(Classical)

1066
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:01,544
&& (Classical)

1067
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:13,527
- No one here yet, huh?
- No. No one but she.

1068
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,621
- Consarn it!
- What's the matter?

1069
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,996
Afraid you'll lose your bet
with the squire?

1070
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,764
Ah, it's not that.
It - It just makes me look so -

1071
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:26,466
- (Mary)Jabez.
- See? They're coming.

1072
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,980
- Daniel, I thought you were in bed.
- I got up, Mommy, because -

1073
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,550
- What did you do to that cat?
- Nothing.

1074
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:38,449
She was crying in front of my window.
I think she's sick.

1075
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,522
Oh, she's probably hungry.

1076
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:43,785
- May I give her something to eat?
- Of course you may.

1077
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:49,057
- Oh, why don't they come?
- Jabez, couldn't they
play something gayer?

1078
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:52,292
That's the kind of music
they play for rich people.

1079
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,078
Belle. Belle!

1080
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,149
Belle. Who are those people out there?
What do they want?

1081
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,515
They want to see how fine
Jabez Stone lives these days.

1082
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,611
They're waiting
for your guests, too.

1083
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:20,960
Consarn it.! I'm paying you for playing.!
So keep on playing.!

1084
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,822
&&(Classical)

1085
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:28,198
- Jabez.
- Well, what do you think
about the new house, Mary?

1086
01:13:28,303 --> 01:13:31,670
Is it larger than Webster's
at Marshfield? What about it?
You've been there.

1087
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:36,040
Well, it - it's different, that's all.

1088
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:39,672
What's the matter with them?
Why don't they come?

1089
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:44,116
He's certainly made himself
the big frog in the little puddle
around here, hasn't he?

1090
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,687
That isn't the worst.
Hank.

1091
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:50,088
Show Mr. Webster
that foul contract you got with Jabez.

1092
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:56,222
You see, Mr. Webster, it all seemed
so simple when it started.

1093
01:13:56,331 --> 01:13:59,061
(Hank)
Just like gettin'loans for nothin;

1094
01:13:59,168 --> 01:14:01,659
But when I couldn't pay him
after that big hail...

1095
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,297
he was worse than all the rest
of the loan sharks.

1096
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:09,241
I wish now I'd listened to you, Tom,
and joined the grange.

1097
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,710
Well, I'm afraid he's got you.

1098
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:15,306
All of you. Sewed up tight
in his money pocket.

1099
01:14:16,785 --> 01:14:19,720
Well, isn't there anything you can do,
Mr. Webster?

1100
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,790
Oh, I shall do my best.

1101
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,901
I see why you're here.

1102
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:37,767
Belle. Didn't I tell you
to leave her alone?

1103
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,966
You knew nobody was coming.

1104
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:42,270
- I didn't.
- You're lying.

1105
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:45,346
Lying to you?
Why should I?

1106
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,506
You know that you are
in my house.

1107
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:50,517
I know, and you could
show me the door.

1108
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,417
You would, too, if you weren't
still hoping the guests might arrive.

1109
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:56,753
You think you're smart,
Mrs. Stone.

1110
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:00,795
You thinkJabez will be lonely,
and you can be near him again.

1111
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:03,364
Looks like your big chance tonight.

1112
01:15:04,633 --> 01:15:06,828
But you're wrong.

1113
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:10,393
You can't win him back.
Not that way.

1114
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,373
- That's my problem.
- (Door Opens)

1115
01:15:13,475 --> 01:15:16,171
- Welcome, Mr. Stevens.
- Good evening, Mrs. Stone.

1116
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:18,439
- I'm so glad you came.
- Yes.

1117
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:20,447
- Good evening, Jabez.
- Good evening. Come in.

1118
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:23,279
- I'm sorry. I'm a little late.
- Oh, no, you're not.

1119
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:25,785
- That's no place for a cat.
- She's sick, Pa.

1120
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:28,448
Never mind.
Take her away.

1121
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,525
Come on.
Sit down.

1122
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:36,929
- Where is everybody?
- I - I don't know.
I can't figure it out.

1123
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,466
I invited them all.

1124
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,968
What a fine boy
you have, Jabez.

1125
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,163
How old is he now?
About seven, isn't he?

1126
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:46,503
No, not seven.
I'm sure.

1127
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:51,068
- Well, it seems to me
I remember when you paid me.
- Never mind.

1128
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,610
What's the matter with you?
You look so -

1129
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,519
- Aren't you afraid?
- Afraid of what?

1130
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,683
Of what happens after we die.

1131
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,594
Are you plumb crazy, man?

1132
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:11,928
What do you think happens?
We're buried. That's all.

1133
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,025
But what becomes
of our souls?

1134
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:16,161
Why are you afraid about
something that isn't there?

1135
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:18,432
Don't say that.

1136
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,941
I know it is.
I found out.

1137
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:24,137
All right.
So it's buried with you.

1138
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,777
But what if one
hasn't a soul anymore?

1139
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:29,976
What of that?

1140
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:33,921
Well, what about it?
Who cares anyhow?

1141
01:16:34,022 --> 01:16:37,253
I do. And I think
you should, too.

1142
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,992
Stevens, what's this
all leading up to?

1143
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:47,933
You know something.
Come on. Out with it.
You know something about me.

1144
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,178
Belle, who are these people?

1145
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:06,618
They're all friends of mine.
From over the mountain.

1146
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:10,158
- Hooray forJabez Stone.
- (Eerie, Hushed Voices)
Hooray forJabez Stone.

1147
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:13,250
Thanks. Welcome.
Eat, drink.

1148
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:17,890
- And dance!
- (Eerie Voices)
Dance, dance, dance, dance!

1149
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:23,061
- Music.
- &&(Eerie Melody)

1150
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:25,435
(Mary)Jabez.!
Mr. Webster's coming.!

1151
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,402
- Well, where is he?
- That's his buggy
coming up the hill, isn't it?

1152
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:33,913
Mr. Stevens, let's dance.

1153
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:35,916
No, no. I can't dance.

1154
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:38,350
- Oh, yes, you can dance with me.
- No, no.

1155
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:41,217
- (Stevens) No.
- &&(Eerie Melody Continues)

1156
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,624
Mr. Webster.
I'm so glad you came.

1157
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:51,256
Are you, Mary? (Chuckles)
Well, I'm glad to see you again.

1158
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:55,436
Well, the party
seems to be quite a success.

1159
01:17:55,537 --> 01:17:58,472
- Welcome, Mr. Webster.
This is a great day for me.
- How are you?

1160
01:17:58,573 --> 01:18:01,542
Come on in, sir, and meet all my guests.
Take the seat of honor.

1161
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:03,702
Oh, that's just fine,
Neighbor Stone...

1162
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:07,771
uh, but you see, I've got to be
very careful about my seats of honor.

1163
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:11,979
Where I sit, I mean. You see,
the whole country has its eye on me.

1164
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:15,056
Anybody in public life
has that difficulty.

1165
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:17,648
Even you, Jabez Stone.

1166
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:21,559
They watch us carefully,
our neighbors and our enemies...

1167
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:24,325
and they see much more
than we think they do...

1168
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,458
and understand much more.

1169
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:28,729
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

1170
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:35,204
- What do you have on your mind?
- You, Jabez Stone.

1171
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,074
You and a lot
of poor farmers hereabouts -

1172
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:41,377
all good men of the earth
and in trouble because of you.

1173
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:44,752
Or am I wrong
about those contracts?

1174
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:48,152
- Without me and my money,
they wouldn't have anything.
- They'd have a good neighbor...

1175
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,521
and that's worth more
than anything else. Much, much more.

1176
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,685
Oh, no.
Not for me it isn't.

1177
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:56,389
I'm sorry you can't see that.

1178
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:58,398
I know you could once.

1179
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:02,334
I heard you make a little speech once
that I'll always remember.

1180
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:04,405
And the others do, too.

1181
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,804
They remember
what a fine fellow you were.

1182
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:10,036
And now they see
how you've changed.

1183
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:13,774
And that's why they didn't
want to come here tonight.

1184
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,850
You're as blind as a Burma bat...

1185
01:19:15,951 --> 01:19:18,715
you and your gold pot.

1186
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:22,221
Mind you, it's not the money I'm
talking about. It's what you make of it.

1187
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,656
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1188
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,663
&&(Melody Gains Tempo)

1189
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:36,560
- Let me tell you something.
- I haven't time to listen to this!

1190
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,401
No, you haven't time
for anything or anybody!

1191
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:42,409
You haven't time for your mother,
your wife or your child.

1192
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:47,909
Oh, I see. It's you.

1193
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:50,314
You. You brought
Daniel Webster here!

1194
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,579
- No, she didn't.
- You're trying to make a fool out of me!

1195
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,212
You played the sneak behind my back,
made up lies against me!

1196
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:58,190
You can get yourself
out of my house right now!

1197
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,921
Come along, Mary.

1198
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:03,293
- Mommy!
- Daniel, you stay here!

1199
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,662
- No! No, I won't!
- Daniel! Daniel!

1200
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:09,069
- Why, you -
- Jabez, please!

1201
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:11,071
I don't want to talk to you!

1202
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:14,631
(Laughing)
You should have done that years ago.

1203
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,234
Fetch me a drink.

1204
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:20,576
Close the windows.
Build a fire.

1205
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,683
Feeling chilly?
(Chuckles)

1206
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:25,378
Wh-Why, what's the matter,
Mr. Stone? You look worried.

1207
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,387
You promised me happiness,
love, friendship.

1208
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,617
Just a minute. I promised you money
and all that money could buy.

1209
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:33,023
I don't recall
any other obligations.

1210
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,619
But, uh -
Well, let's, uh -

1211
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,722
Let's look at the contract, huh?

1212
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:42,270
"Sherwin, Slatterly, Stevens."
I can cross him off the list.

1213
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:45,066
- That Miser Stevens?
- Yes, yes. He's an old customer.

1214
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:51,444
(Muffled Voice)
Help me, Neighbor Stone! Help me!

1215
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:55,505
- That's Miser Stevens's voice.
- Miser Stevens's soul.
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

1216
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:59,582
It can't be.
He's in there dancing.

1217
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,656
He was.

1218
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,303
- Dead?
- In the midst of life...

1219
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:18,201
one really hates to close
these long-standing accounts...

1220
01:21:18,306 --> 01:21:21,673
but, uh, business is business.

1221
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:23,744
Do they all look like moths?

1222
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:26,871
Well, the ones I get
usually do. Yes.

1223
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:28,973
- Are they all so small?
- Small?

1224
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:31,314
Oh, I see what you mean.
Why, they vary.

1225
01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:33,387
Now, a man
like Daniel Webster...

1226
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:36,548
if I ever got hold of him, I wouldn't
be able to keep him in my pocket.

1227
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:39,320
I'd have to have
a special box built for him.

1228
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:41,691
Even so, I imagine the wingspan
would be astonishing.

1229
01:21:41,796 --> 01:21:45,425
(Chuckles) Now, in your case, I'd be
able to put you in my vest pocket.

1230
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:52,263
(Jabez) No, no.!
My time isn't up yet.!

1231
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,379
Trying to break our contract,
Mr. Stone?

1232
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:06,079
- I'm through with you!
- (Chuckles)

1233
01:22:06,187 --> 01:22:08,451
What a headstrong fellow.

1234
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:12,925
- I guess you're quite prepared
to suffer the consequences.
- My time isn't up yet.

1235
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:16,020
But you violated clause five
of our contract.

1236
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,292
I could collect
right now if I chose.

1237
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,402
Oh, no.
No, no. Not now.

1238
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:24,537
I have so many things
to make up for.

1239
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:28,405
Suddenly you seem quite desperate,
Mr. Stone.

1240
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,604
You know I'm a generous man.
I'm always open to reason.

1241
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:33,578
Uh, with a little security, I -

1242
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,707
Anything, anything.
You can have it all back.

1243
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:38,411
The money, the house, the farm -
the whole caboodle!

1244
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,422
Oh, I'm afraid that's not
the sort of security I was thinking of.

1245
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:45,982
You see, there's that
promising little fellow.

1246
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,561
Your son.

1247
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:52,326
No. Oh, no.

1248
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:57,404
Not my son. Not him.

1249
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,736
I'd rather go with you now
no matter what happens to me.

1250
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:03,936
Ah. It's not fair
to bargain with you now.

1251
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:07,774
I'll give you until midnight.

1252
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:10,783
Until midnight, Mr. Stone,
but not one minute more.

1253
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:16,016
Daniel. Daniel.
Daniel. Daniel!

1254
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:19,093
Daniel! Daniel!
Mary!

1255
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,763
Daniel! Daniel!

1256
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,031
Daniel.! Mary.! Daniel.!

1257
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:33,140
Mary, where are you?

1258
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:47,083
(Whimpering)
Oh, Lord, have mercy!

1259
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:22,823
Jabez.

1260
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:31,592
(Sobbing)
Oh, Ma.

1261
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:34,224
Little Daniel. Mary.

1262
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:38,032
(Pants)
Where are they?

1263
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:41,700
Gone with Mr. Webster
to Marshfield, son.

1264
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:43,778
You told Mary to go.

1265
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:26,475
Jabez! Are you coming with me
over the mountain? Jabez!

1266
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:39,061
Mary! Mary!
Mr. Webster!

1267
01:25:43,505 --> 01:25:45,530
- Mary! Oh, Mary!
- Jabez!

1268
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:48,541
Forgive me, Mary!
Forgive me!

1269
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:51,476
- Mr. Webster, you take care of the boy.
- Oh, Jabez!

1270
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:54,343
(Panting)
My time's up, Mary.

1271
01:25:54,449 --> 01:25:58,385
No, it isn't. I'd fight 10,000 devils
to save a New Hampshire man.

1272
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,951
It's here you said
you closed the deal with him?

1273
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,620
Yes, Mr. Webster.
It's here where it all began.

1274
01:26:08,730 --> 01:26:10,755
I see.

1275
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:13,527
This is where he wants
to collect, too, hmm?

1276
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:17,536
Here, Jabez.

1277
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:19,732
- Oh, Mary.
- Can't I stay?

1278
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,401
No, Mary, I think you'd
better go back to the house.

1279
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,411
What love and trust can do
for a husband, you've done for yours.

1280
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:27,413
And, frankly speaking,
in a few moments...

1281
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,483
this is not going to be
any place for a lady.

1282
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:31,984
- Mr. Webster, you will help him then?
- I'll do my best.

1283
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:34,054
You must go, Mary.

1284
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:40,226
Now, don't be afraid, Jabez.
Remember what the Good Book says.

1285
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:42,762
"Set me as a seal
upon thy heart...

1286
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:46,766
as a seal upon thine arm;
for love is strong as death."

1287
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:53,340
We grow plucky women
in New England.

1288
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:55,500
How long do we have to wait?

1289
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,510
- Till midnight.
- Oh, that's fine.

1290
01:26:57,612 --> 01:27:01,514
- Then we have time to christen a jug.
- (Dog Barking)

1291
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:06,019
Old Medford rum.
Oh, there's nothing like it.

1292
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,021
You know, somehow or other...

1293
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:12,615
waiting becomes wonderfully shorter
with a jug.

1294
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:16,527
- (Dog Barking)
- I saw an inchworm once
take a drop of this...

1295
01:27:16,631 --> 01:27:20,727
and he stood right up on his hind legs
and bit a bee. (Chuckles)

1296
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:25,033
(Dog Howling)

1297
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,869
- Will you have a nip?
- No, there's no joy in it for me.

1298
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:29,876
Oh, come, come, now.

1299
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:32,538
Just because you sold
your soul to the devil...

1300
01:27:32,647 --> 01:27:35,138
that needn't make you
a teetotaler.

1301
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,150
(Knocking)

1302
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,220
Hurry, Mr. Webster.
Hurry while you still have time.

1303
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:43,222
No, no. I never left a jug
or a case half-finished in all my life.

1304
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:46,521
- (Knocking)
- Come in.

1305
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:51,621
(Wind Whistling)

1306
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:59,237
Ah. So we meet again,
Mr. Webster.

1307
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,774
Yes. I'm the attorney of record
forJabez Stone.

1308
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:04,504
- Might I ask your name?
- Scratch will do for the evening.

1309
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,705
Ah. May I join you?

1310
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:08,714
Certainly, but be careful.

1311
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:12,081
Medford rum
has an uncanny habit of kicking back,
even with old-timers like yourself.

1312
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:14,654
(Chuckles) Even kicked back
once at you, didn't it?

1313
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:17,350
- Who? Me?
- Oh. Not that you've ever been drunk.

1314
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:19,517
No. No, indeed,
Mr. Webster.

1315
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:22,926
But a kind of a -
an overpowering lassitude.

1316
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,261
Or more plainly,
a deep, enveloping sleep.

1317
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:27,391
Why, there isn't
enough old Medford rum...

1318
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:29,470
in the whole of New Hampshire
to make me sleepy.

1319
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,902
Talk never proved that question,
Mr. Webster.

1320
01:28:32,006 --> 01:28:34,065
- Cup for cup. What do you say?
- All right.

1321
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:37,042
- Cup for cup.
- Mr. Webster, don't!

1322
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:40,979
- Oh, don't be afraid.
- Now, Mr. Stone, are you
willing to give me your son...

1323
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:43,550
- in exchange for an extension
of our contract?
- Never!

1324
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:47,143
Surely this matter can be settled
out of court without any difficulty.

1325
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,621
My client is prepared
to offer a compromise.

1326
01:28:49,724 --> 01:28:52,557
Ten, twenty, thirty thousand dollars.
Name your figure.

1327
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:56,289
- I'll raise it even if I
have to mortgage Marshfield.
- (Chuckles)

1328
01:28:56,397 --> 01:29:00,163
Your spirited efforts on behalf of
your client do you credit, Mr. Webster.

1329
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:04,034
But if you have no further arguments
to adduce, I'll take him along now.

1330
01:29:04,138 --> 01:29:06,436
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch.

1331
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,475
If you have any evidence, produce it.

1332
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:13,639
Of course. All open and above board,
in due and legal form.

1333
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:16,842
- That your signature?
- You know darn well it is.

1334
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:19,010
Hmm. This appears -

1335
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,749
uh, mind you, I say appears
to be properly drawn.

1336
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:25,052
But you shan't have this man.

1337
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:27,320
A man isn't a piece of property.

1338
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:29,396
Mr. Stone is an American citizen...

1339
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:33,126
and an American citizen cannot be forced
into the service of a foreign prince.

1340
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:36,169
"Foreign"?
Who calls me a foreigner?

1341
01:29:36,270 --> 01:29:39,068
Oh, I never heard of the de -

1342
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:41,300
I never heard of you
claiming American citizenship.

1343
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,377
And who with a better right?

1344
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:47,107
When the first wrong was done
to the first Indian, I was there.

1345
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,651
When the first slaver put out
for the Congo, I stood on the deck.

1346
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:54,415
Am I not still spoken of
in every church in New England?

1347
01:29:54,522 --> 01:29:57,650
(Chuckles) It's true, the North
claims me for a Southerner...

1348
01:29:57,759 --> 01:30:00,626
and the South for a Northerner,
but I'm neither.

1349
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,697
Tell the truth, Mr. Webster,
though I don't like to boast of it...

1350
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,823
my name is older in the country
than yours.

1351
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:08,299
Then I stand on the Constitution.

1352
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,769
I demand a trial for my client.

1353
01:30:10,872 --> 01:30:13,102
- You mean a jury trial?
- I do.

1354
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:16,335
And if I can't win this case
with a jury, you'll have me, too.

1355
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:18,878
(Whistles)

1356
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:22,074
If two New Hampshire men
aren't a match for the devil...

1357
01:30:22,183 --> 01:30:24,242
we'd better give the country
back to the Indians.

1358
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:27,321
- Very well. You shall
have your way, Mr. Webster.
- (Chuckles)

1359
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,858
But you'll have to admit that this is
hardly the case for an ordinary jury.

1360
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,949
(Scoffs)
Be it the quick or the dead.

1361
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:36,757
- So it be an American judge
and an American jury.
- Quick or the dead.

1362
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:38,832
You have said it.
(Chuckles)

1363
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:42,361
May the better man win,
Mr. Webster.

1364
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:44,461
I'll drink to that,
Mr. Scratch.

1365
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:56,214
(Knocking Echoes)

1366
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:59,844
You must pardon the leathery toughness
of one or two.

1367
01:31:01,222 --> 01:31:03,520
Mr. Webster!

1368
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:07,321
Captain Kidd.
He killed men for gold.

1369
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:09,919
Simon Girty, the renegade.

1370
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:12,295
He burned men for gold.

1371
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,834
Governor Dale.
He broke men on the wheel.

1372
01:31:16,838 --> 01:31:19,602
Asa, the Black Monk.
He choked them to death.

1373
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:21,607
(Giggles)

1374
01:31:21,709 --> 01:31:24,439
Floyd Ireson
and Stede Bonnet...

1375
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:26,513
the fiendish butchers.

1376
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,082
Walter Butler,
king of the massacre.

1377
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:34,317
Big and Little Harp,
robbers and murderers.

1378
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:38,716
Teach, the cutthroat.

1379
01:31:41,028 --> 01:31:42,996
Morton, the vicious lawyer.

1380
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,897
And General Benedict Arnold.

1381
01:31:47,001 --> 01:31:48,969
You remember him, no doubt.

1382
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:52,562
Ajury of the damned.

1383
01:31:52,673 --> 01:31:55,039
Dastards, liars, traitors, knaves.

1384
01:31:57,912 --> 01:31:59,812
This is monstrous.

1385
01:31:59,914 --> 01:32:02,712
You asked for a jury trial, Mr. Webster.
Your suggestion.

1386
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:06,514
- The quick or the dead.
- I asked for a fair trial.

1387
01:32:06,621 --> 01:32:08,953
Americans all.
(Snickering)

1388
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:12,355
- (Bells Jingling)
- Oyez, oyez, oyez.

1389
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,360
The trial tream
of the midnight court...

1390
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:18,262
of the state of New Hampshire in the
county of Franklin is now in session.

1391
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,527
Justice Hawthorne presiding.

1392
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:24,164
- (Bells Jingling)
- Oyez, oyez, oyez.

1393
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:26,502
The Devil versus Jabez Stone.

1394
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:29,872
(Bells Jingling)

1395
01:32:38,686 --> 01:32:40,677
Who appears for the plaintiff?

1396
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:42,688
I, Your Honor.

1397
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:45,623
- And for the defendant?
- I, Your Honor.

1398
01:32:45,726 --> 01:32:48,718
Are you content with the jury,
Mr. Webster?

1399
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:52,094
I object to General Benedict Arnold,
Your Honor.

1400
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:55,134
He was a flagrant traitor
to the great American cause.

1401
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:58,501
- Objection denied.
- (EerieJeering)

1402
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:00,369
Prosecution, proceed.

1403
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:02,999
Ah.

1404
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:06,841
Your Honor.
Gentlemen of the jury.

1405
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:09,439
This case need not detain us long.

1406
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:11,450
It concerns one thing alone.

1407
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:14,112
The transference, barter, sale
of a certain piece of property...

1408
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:17,987
to wit, his soul,
byJabez Stone.

1409
01:33:18,092 --> 01:33:21,061
Now, transference, barter or sale
is attested by a deed.

1410
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:25,395
I offer the deed in evidence
and mark it Exhibit "A."

1411
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:28,491
- I object!
- Objection denied.

1412
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:32,095
- (Jeering)
- I object to this jury, Your Honor.

1413
01:33:32,206 --> 01:33:35,039
I move it be discharged
for flagrant and open bias.

1414
01:33:35,142 --> 01:33:38,475
- Objection denied.
- (Jeering)

1415
01:33:38,579 --> 01:33:41,047
Mark it Exhibit "A."

1416
01:33:42,316 --> 01:33:44,841
I shall now callJabez Stone
to the witness stand.

1417
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:47,682
Jabez Stone
to the witness stand.

1418
01:34:06,073 --> 01:34:08,007
Mr. Stone...

1419
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,805
did you or did you not
sign that document?

1420
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:12,811
But you tricked me into it.

1421
01:34:12,913 --> 01:34:14,813
You told me
my soul was nothing -

1422
01:34:14,915 --> 01:34:17,281
that I could forget all about a soul
in exchange for money.

1423
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:21,549
- But that was a lie, a lie, a lie!
- (Chuckling)

1424
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,715
That is highly irrelevant
to the case, Your Honor.

1425
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:26,224
Leave out the soul.
Proceed.

1426
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:28,227
I should like to ask Mr. Stone...

1427
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:31,355
whether or not I faithfully fulfilled
my part of the bargain.

1428
01:34:31,465 --> 01:34:34,161
Didn't I give you seven years
of good luck and prosperity?

1429
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:36,532
Didn't I make you
the richest man in the country?

1430
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:39,197
Yes, I'm the richest man
in the country.

1431
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:43,766
I can't see, I can't think of anything
but money, money, money, money, money!

1432
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:48,042
Well, I'm hardly responsible
for the pricking of your wholly
unnecessary conscience.

1433
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:53,449
Prosecution rests.

1434
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:57,817
And does the jury wish
to consider the case?

1435
01:35:01,162 --> 01:35:04,563
Evidently it does not.
Take your man, Mr. Scratch.

1436
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:07,395
I protest, Your Honor!
I wish to cross-examine to prove -

1437
01:35:07,501 --> 01:35:10,129
There will be no cross-examination
in this court.

1438
01:35:13,507 --> 01:35:15,566
(EerieJeering)

1439
01:35:15,676 --> 01:35:18,167
You may speak if you want to...

1440
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:21,271
but let me warn you, Mr. Webster.

1441
01:35:21,382 --> 01:35:24,010
If you speak
and fail to convince us...

1442
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:28,246
you too are doomed.

1443
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:49,534
- Lost and gone.
- (Bell Tolls)

1444
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:52,043
- Lost and gone.
- Lost and gone.

1445
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:54,876
- (Bell Tolls)
- (Eerie, Hushed Voice)
Drag him down with us.

1446
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:58,042
- Drag him down with us.
- Lost and gone.

1447
01:35:58,152 --> 01:36:01,519
- (Bell Tolls)
- Lost and gone. Lost and gone.

1448
01:36:01,622 --> 01:36:03,715
- Lost and gone.
- Be still!

1449
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:26,778
Gentlemen of the jury.

1450
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:30,373
Tonight it is my privilege
to address a group of men...

1451
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:34,745
I've long been acquainted with
in song and story...

1452
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:41,391
- but men I had never hoped to see.
- (EerieJeering)

1453
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:44,726
My worthy opponent,
Mr. Scratch...

1454
01:36:44,832 --> 01:36:46,993
called you Americans all.

1455
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:49,934
Mr. Scratch is right.

1456
01:36:50,037 --> 01:36:52,062
You were Americans all.

1457
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:57,366
Oh, what a heritage
you were born to share.

1458
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:02,343
Gentlemen of the jury,
I envy you...

1459
01:37:03,717 --> 01:37:07,118
for you were present
at the birth of a mighty union.

1460
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:11,787
It was given to you to hear
those first cries of pain...

1461
01:37:11,892 --> 01:37:14,292
and behold a shining babe...

1462
01:37:14,395 --> 01:37:17,421
born of blood and tears.

1463
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:24,032
You are called upon tonight
to judge a man named...

1464
01:37:24,138 --> 01:37:26,629
Jabez Stone.

1465
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,504
What is his case?

1466
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:33,011
He is accused
of breach of contract.

1467
01:37:33,113 --> 01:37:36,947
He made a deal
to find a shortcut in his life -

1468
01:37:37,051 --> 01:37:39,042
to get rich quickly.

1469
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:42,145
The same kind of a deal
all of you once made.

1470
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:46,354
You, Benedict Arnold.

1471
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:50,829
I speak to you first because
you are better known than the
rest of your colleagues here.

1472
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:54,389
What a different song
yours could have been.

1473
01:37:56,003 --> 01:37:59,803
A friend of Washington
and Lafayette. A soldier.

1474
01:38:02,076 --> 01:38:06,274
General Arnold, you fought so gallantly
for the American cause till -

1475
01:38:07,648 --> 01:38:11,084
Let me see.
What was the date? 1779.

1476
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:15,587
That date burned in your heart.

1477
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:19,090
The lure of gold
made you betray that cause.

1478
01:38:19,193 --> 01:38:22,594
And you, Simon Girty,
now known to all as "renegade."

1479
01:38:22,696 --> 01:38:25,096
A loathsome word.

1480
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:28,032
You also took that other way.
And you, Walter Butler.

1481
01:38:28,135 --> 01:38:30,763
What would you give
for another chance...

1482
01:38:30,871 --> 01:38:34,967
to see the grasses grow in Cherry Valley
without the stain of blood?

1483
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,407
I could go on and on
and name you all...

1484
01:38:37,511 --> 01:38:39,411
but there's no need of that.

1485
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:43,347
Why stir the wounds?
I know they pain enough.

1486
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,441
You were fooled
likeJabez Stone...

1487
01:38:45,552 --> 01:38:49,318
fooled and trapped in your desire
to rebel against your fate.

1488
01:38:49,423 --> 01:38:51,391
Gentlemen of the jury...

1489
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:55,895
it is the eternal right of every man
to raise his fist against his fate!

1490
01:38:57,798 --> 01:39:01,359
But when he does,
he's at crossroads.

1491
01:39:01,468 --> 01:39:04,801
You took the wrong turn;
so did Jabez Stone.

1492
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,897
But he found it out in time.

1493
01:39:08,008 --> 01:39:09,999
He's here tonight
to save his soul.

1494
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:12,840
Gentlemen of the jury...

1495
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:16,644
I ask you to giveJabez Stone another
chance to walk upon this earth...

1496
01:39:17,818 --> 01:39:19,843
among the trees...

1497
01:39:19,954 --> 01:39:22,149
the growing corn...

1498
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:24,690
and the smell of grasses
in the spring.

1499
01:39:27,027 --> 01:39:28,995
What would you all give
for another chance...

1500
01:39:29,096 --> 01:39:31,860
to see those things
you must all remember...

1501
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:34,901
and often long to touch again?

1502
01:39:35,002 --> 01:39:37,095
For you were all men once.

1503
01:39:37,204 --> 01:39:40,571
Clean American air
was in your lungs...

1504
01:39:40,674 --> 01:39:43,802
and you breathed it deeply...

1505
01:39:43,911 --> 01:39:47,642
for it was free and blew across
an earth you loved.

1506
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,676
These are common things
I speak of.

1507
01:39:51,785 --> 01:39:55,619
Small things,
but they are good things.

1508
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:58,351
Yet, without your soul,
they mean nothing.

1509
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:00,393
Without your soul, they sicken.

1510
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,054
(Chuckles)
Mr. Scratch once told you...

1511
01:40:03,163 --> 01:40:07,429
that your soul meant nothing,
and you believed him...

1512
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:09,593
and you lost your freedom.

1513
01:40:09,703 --> 01:40:12,035
Freedom isn't just a big word.

1514
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:15,165
It is the morning
and the bread and the risen sun!

1515
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:18,403
It was for freedom we came
to these shores in boats and ships!

1516
01:40:18,512 --> 01:40:21,413
It was a long journey,
a hard one and a bitter one!

1517
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:26,111
Yes, there is sadness
in being a man.

1518
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,313
But it is a proud thing, too...

1519
01:40:28,422 --> 01:40:32,381
and out of the suffering
and the starvation
and the wrong and the right...

1520
01:40:32,493 --> 01:40:36,827
a new thing has come:
a free man.

1521
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:39,160
And when the whips
of the oppressors are broken...

1522
01:40:39,266 --> 01:40:41,427
and their names forgotten
and destroyed...

1523
01:40:43,237 --> 01:40:47,401
free men will be talking
and walking under a free star.

1524
01:40:47,508 --> 01:40:52,445
Yes. We have planted freedom
in this earth like wheat.

1525
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:56,878
And we have said
to the skies above us...

1526
01:40:56,984 --> 01:40:59,680
"A man shall own his own soul."

1527
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,986
Now, here is this man.

1528
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:07,356
He is your brother.
You were Americans all.

1529
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:10,362
You can't be on his side,
the side of the oppressor!

1530
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:12,659
LetJabez Stone keep his soul...

1531
01:41:12,766 --> 01:41:14,757
the soul which doesn't belong
to him alone...

1532
01:41:14,868 --> 01:41:17,393
but to his family,
his son and his country!

1533
01:41:17,504 --> 01:41:21,463
Gentlemen of the jury,
don't let this country go to the devil!

1534
01:41:23,811 --> 01:41:26,871
FreeJabez Stone.

1535
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:29,972
God bless the United States
and the men who made her free.

1536
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:10,322
The jury...

1537
01:42:10,424 --> 01:42:12,324
finds for the defendant.

1538
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:15,122
- Mr. Webster!
- (Rooster Crows)

1539
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:17,789
Allow me to congratulate you
as one gentlemen to another, sir.

1540
01:42:17,898 --> 01:42:19,866
By the 13 original colonies!

1541
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:24,063
You double-barreled, slab-sided,
lantern-jawed, note-shaving crook!

1542
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:29,131
Get out of here! And don't
you ever come back to the
state of New Hampshire again!

1543
01:42:29,243 --> 01:42:32,076
- If I ever become the president
of the United States -
- You?

1544
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:34,613
(Chuckles) You'll never be president.
I'll see to that.

1545
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:47,818
- Mary.
- Oh, Jabez!

1546
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:51,196
- I think we deserve a little breakfast.
- Oh, Mr. Webster!

1547
01:42:51,298 --> 01:42:53,232
It's good to see you
smile again, Mary.

1548
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:55,267
(Tom)
Jabez? Jabez.!

1549
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,633
Jabez, your new house
is on fire!

1550
01:42:57,738 --> 01:42:59,638
Good. The consarn thing
ought to burn.

1551
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:02,675
But I'm glad you're here. There are
some other things I want to settle.

1552
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:05,142
- Those contracts.
- First, let's all have breakfast.

1553
01:43:05,245 --> 01:43:07,270
- Oh, thank you, Mary.
- Here they are.

1554
01:43:07,381 --> 01:43:10,043
Ma! Ma, there's
a few more people coming.

1555
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:12,118
- I've seen 'em.
- Is there enough?

1556
01:43:12,219 --> 01:43:14,653
Why, certainly.
We've got plenty for everybody.

1557
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:17,849
- Bread and butter and eggs and sausage.
- What about Mr. Webster's pie?

1558
01:43:17,958 --> 01:43:19,892
Don't you worry.
I've got it all ready.

1559
01:43:19,993 --> 01:43:24,293
- Daniel, tell 'em to hurry up.
The coffee's gettin' cold.
- Yes, Granny.

1560
01:43:24,398 --> 01:43:27,424
- Breakfast is ready!
- Well, Jabez, now that you've
torn up the contracts...

1561
01:43:27,534 --> 01:43:29,434
would you like
to join the grange?

1562
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:33,097
Of course, Tom.
I'd be glad to. From now on,
we'll all work together, huh?

1563
01:43:33,207 --> 01:43:35,107
(Mary)
Please, everybody, sit down.

1564
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:38,042
Well, this is a wonderful spread
you have here, Mary.

1565
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:40,113
(Chattering)

1566
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:42,114
You know,
there's nothing better...

1567
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:44,946
than a good, old-fashioned country
breakfast on a morning like this.

1568
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:47,418
- Where's Ma Stone?
- Oh, she'll be here in a minute.

1569
01:43:47,521 --> 01:43:49,955
- She's got a special surprise for you.
- Oh.

1570
01:43:50,057 --> 01:43:52,355
- Granny!
- (Mary) Come on, Ma.!

1571
01:43:52,459 --> 01:43:54,427
(Tom)
There she is.!

1572
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,630
- Peach pie?
- Peach pie.

1573
01:44:00,434 --> 01:44:03,926
Well! What the devil!

1574
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:14,904
Well, who laughs last?

1575
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:17,813
(All Laughing)
