1
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:11,087
Hey, mister.
Get over here.

2
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:14,487
Hey!

3
00:01:16,602 --> 00:01:17,602
Come here!

4
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:27,981
There's no witnesses.

5
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:30,481
Nobody heard anything
over the trains running.

6
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:36,431
Looks like a decade of skag
and skin popping.

7
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,632
Yes, but it's not an O.D.

8
00:01:37,632 --> 00:01:39,711
There's no foam around
his mouth and nose.

9
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,865
You see that?

10
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,968
Take a look at that syringe.

11
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:43,864
There's no blood in it.

12
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,850
That's right, and that's 'cause
it's not a junkie syringe.

13
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,004
Junkie syringe is one cc, tops.

14
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,456
That's ten;
it's huge.

15
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:51,064
Maybe the guy is a glutton.

16
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:54,064
Maybe. Junkie or not ...

17
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,491
somebody killed this man.

18
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:36,116
1x15 Dead Woman Walking

19
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,696
We got a Carl Aspen.
A long record.

20
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:58,043
A few possession charges,
mostly assault and battery.

21
00:02:58,043 --> 00:03:00,581
Looks like he got
the battery this time.

22
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:03,275
Lacerations on the face and lip.

23
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:06,525
I saw a couple of torn nails
so I bagged his hands.

24
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:08,919
May be able to get
some scrapings.

25
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,919
Oh! Horatio.

26
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:16,394
And what do we have there?

27
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:17,315
It's damp.

28
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:19,468
Maybe from the substance
inside the syringe.

29
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:20,728
How much is there?

30
00:03:20,728 --> 00:03:21,946
$203.

31
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:24,461
Well, that rules out
money as a motive.

32
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,262
Alexx, do you have
a time of death?

33
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:27,727
No corneal cloudiness.

34
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:30,364
So, approximately an
hour to two hours ago.

35
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:32,911
So, that makes it between
4:00 A.M. and 6:00 A.M.

36
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:36,102
So, Carl here
was looking to score,

37
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:39,102
needed money, but jumped
the wrong person, didn't he?

38
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:43,036
Eric.

39
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,336
What's up, H?

40
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:46,749
That's a pencil, isn't it?

41
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:47,749
Yes, it is.

42
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:55,368
Looks like it's been
chewed up.

43
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,172
It's got teeth marks.

44
00:03:57,172 --> 00:04:00,178
Okay, let's process it
for saliva and epithelials.

45
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,178
You got it.

46
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:21,054
Screen this for opiates.

47
00:04:22,854 --> 00:04:24,291
Hey.
Hey.

48
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,923
I think I found the
cause of death.

49
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,449
Before you open him?

50
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:29,842
Cervical fracture.

51
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:32,442
Looks like somebody
snapped his neck.

52
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:38,236
Have you tested
under his nails for skin?

53
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,866
Just about to.

54
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,158
Wait a minute.

55
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,244
His hand wasn't like
this on the scene.

56
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,753
You think that's
parasite activity?

57
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:49,007
Not like I've ever seen.

58
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,929
That's got to be a chemical burn,
though, right?

59
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:55,099
But that would have
presented immediately.

60
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:56,863
Alexx?

61
00:04:57,863 --> 00:05:00,868
There's only one thing
I know that burns like that.

62
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,496
Radiation.
We can't stay here.

63
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:04,911
Got to notify the team;
they may have been exposed, too.

64
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,079
We have an
emergency situation.

65
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,869
Please find the
closest exit,

66
00:05:10,869 --> 00:05:13,569
and evacuate as quickly
and as safely as possible.

67
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:29,037
I don't think this
is a fire drill.

68
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:39,203
Yeah, I was just leaving.

69
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:40,736
Checking up on me?

70
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,154
Turn around.

71
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:44,727
Why are you standing there?
What's wrong?

72
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:48,952
Listen, Horatio and Alexx
found radioactivity on the victim.

73
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:50,839
How bad?
Nobody knows yet.

74
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,322
RMS are going to be
here any second.

75
00:05:52,322 --> 00:05:53,884
They're setting up a
hot zone outside.

76
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:55,574
So, hurry up, all right?

77
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,289
It's eating through his flesh.

78
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,618
Odorless, tasteless and invisible.

79
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:06,060
Too many neutrons
destabilize the atom.

80
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
All those atoms ripping apart,
releasing energy.

81
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:14,403
Makes you wonder
what it's done to us.

82
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:16,741
Just hope it hasn't
rearranged our DNA.

83
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:19,429
Here's Radiation
Management.

84
00:06:19,429 --> 00:06:20,664
Waiting for us?

85
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:21,875
You better believe it.

86
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,180
Definitely have an air
contaminant in here.

87
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,180
We think the hand
is the source.

88
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,635
Ooh, hot hand.

89
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:35,835
Medium-level radiation.

90
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,900
Let's make this sucker safe.

91
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:01,630
What's in that coffeemaker?

92
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,133
Cerrobend.

93
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:05,110
A soft-melting alloy.

94
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,544
Neutralizes the
radioactive particles.

95
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,742
Kind of like freezing it.

96
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:13,979
We should get you
two to scrubdown.

97
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,180
Roger that.

98
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,888
Okay, let's get the CDC to
quarantine the crime scene...

99
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:19,912
till we know what
we've got. Right.

100
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:21,601
You're both negative
for radioactivity.

101
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,631
Okay. So, that means
we just need to contain ...

102
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:25,365
the contaminated
evidence, right?

103
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:26,703
And clean the dirty air.

104
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,569
This will tell us if it's nuclear,

105
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,569
medical, or right out
of the ground.

106
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:32,775
Let me ask you a question.

107
00:07:32,775 --> 00:07:35,477
Could you administer radioactive
material by syringe?

108
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,975
Radiation therapy
for cancer patients.

109
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:38,714
Attacks tumors.

110
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:42,624
Junkie mistook radioactive isotopes
for pharmaceutical narcotics.

111
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:44,905
Possible. It's not like it
glows or anything.

112
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,198
Syringes aren't marked.

113
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:47,398
A junkie could mistake
it for anything.

114
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:53,116
What's this?
Some grade-a smack?

115
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,616
I just won the lotto.

116
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:01,341
All right.
Let's go.

117
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,970
Delko has definitely
been exposed.

118
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,689
Yeah, but to what?

119
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,929
I mean, there are hundreds
of types of radioactivity.

120
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,163
Well, it basically
breaks down like this.

121
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:23,589
Say you have a pencil, right?

122
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:24,671
You put that on your skin,

123
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,857
that's going to wash right
off 'cause it's an alpha particle.

124
00:08:26,857 --> 00:08:28,372
It's low-level radiation.

125
00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,461
You have a pen,
that's a beta particle.

126
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:31,301
Has more energy.

127
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:33,102
That will sink into something.

128
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:35,343
And then you got gamma,
which is totally toxic.

129
00:08:35,343 --> 00:08:37,486
Goes right through you.
Burns you from the inside out.

130
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:41,382
So, we don't know if it went on Delko,
in Delko or through Delko.

131
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:43,747
Alpha, ...

132
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:45,342
... beta ...

133
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:46,334
... or gamma.

134
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:50,736
Delko could have inhaled that
radioactivity off that money...

135
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:52,136
and not even had a clue.

136
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,633
So, maybe our vic
jumped somebody...

137
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:01,633
who was delivering
radiopharmaceuticals.

138
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:03,455
Any trained delivery guy...

139
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,982
would have handed it over and notified
the nuclear regulatory commission.

140
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:06,902
That would make sense,

141
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:09,919
but I haven't heard anything from
the NRC about anything yet.

142
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,438
So, you're looking for a thief
who steals radioactive isotopes.

143
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,547
In syringe form.

144
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:18,050
The guy is a thief.

145
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,450
He's going to take
as many as he can.

146
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:22,177
Radioactive materials.

147
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:23,760
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

148
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
You thinking terrorism?

149
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:27,359
I think the doses
are too low.

150
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,659
Come on, let me
show you the money.

151
00:09:42,469 --> 00:09:43,469
You ready?
Yup.

152
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,866
Iodine 131 at the
end of its half-life.

153
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,609
Low-level radiation.

154
00:09:57,609 --> 00:09:58,925
Okay.
Your guy should be okay.

155
00:09:58,925 --> 00:10:00,350
Good.

156
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,907
I want to check
the pencil first ...

157
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,107
and then I'll get it 
back to you, all right?

158
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,308
What's up?

159
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,522
The guy said my exposure
was equal to what...

160
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,295
a pilot gets on
a flight to Paris.

161
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:13,774
Well, next time,
take the trip to Paris.

162
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:15,257
It'll be easier on all of us.

163
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,339
Tell me about it.

164
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,297
I heard radioactivity can
cause temporary infertility.

165
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:21,555
So, you and your girlfriend
are temporarily in luck.

166
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:23,674
Yeah, or permanently
screwed.

167
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,449
Hey, heard you were worried
about having children.

168
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:28,438
This should keep you safe.

169
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,938
The bell rings if you
get near radiation.

170
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:35,682
That was nice.

171
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:08,714
"B. King."

172
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Okay.

173
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:15,960
It's Belle King.
Practicing attorney.

174
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,578
Specializing in
environmental law.

175
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,528
All righty.

176
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:24,916
Who is it?

177
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,916
It's the Miami Dade
police department.

178
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:32,027
Let me see
your badges.

179
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,027
Okay.

180
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:43,416
Sorry about that, but, uh,
you can never be too careful.

181
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,387
So, what can I do
for you, officers?

182
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:47,202
Belle King?

183
00:11:47,202 --> 00:11:48,536
Yes, that is me.

184
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:50,822
Ms. King, we have a warrant
to search your premises.

185
00:11:50,822 --> 00:11:52,901
Well, whatever it is you
are looking for my position...

186
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,558
is it's covered by
attorney-client privilege,

187
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:55,841
work product included.

188
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,623
Well, we're not here
to talk about your clients.

189
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:59,418
We're Crime Scene
Investigators.

190
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:04,617
I'm placing a call to
the issuing judge.

191
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:06,906
Thank you.

192
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,616
Whoa.
What the hell is ... ?

193
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:12,616
Is that me?
It can't be you.

194
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:28,896
Ten times
the level at the lab.

195
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,405
"One minute."

196
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,632
What'd the doctor say?

197
00:13:21,632 --> 00:13:23,718
The doctor said that
we have a murder victim...

198
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:25,030
who has less
than one week to live,

199
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,866
but she is
not contagious.

200
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,377
Okay, let's find Eric...

201
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:29,795
and tell him to process the
cash from the crime scene.

202
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:30,771
It's safe to touch now.

203
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:32,523
Calleigh, let's go to
Belle's home.

204
00:13:32,523 --> 00:13:35,294
Iodine 131 decays
into normal iodine.

205
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,285
That's what
you're looking for.

206
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:38,360
Iodine reacts to sulfur.
I'll put some in my kit.

207
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,026
Put some in mine, too.
Okay.

208
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,976
Speed, let's go to
Belle's office and see....

209
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:44,590
if any of her enemies
left her a warning.

210
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,227
You got it.
Thank you.

211
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,213
No silver jumpsuit, hmm?

212
00:14:02,913 --> 00:14:04,110
I guess that means I'm ...

213
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,219
I'm all better.

214
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,582
Well, um ...

215
00:14:07,582 --> 00:14:09,603
you've actually ingested
some isotopes.

216
00:14:09,603 --> 00:14:13,093
An isotope called
iodine 131.

217
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,388
The stuff they use
for cancer therapy?

218
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,411
But I haven't
ingested anything.

219
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:22,645
And even if I did ingest
a little bit of iodine 131,

220
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:23,643
it wouldn't kill you.

221
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,975
Actually, you've ingested
quite a bit of it.

222
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:27,506
Well, how much?

223
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,989
It's my understanding that at
these concentration levels ...

224
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:31,777
How much?

225
00:14:32,777 --> 00:14:35,752
Um ... roughly equivalent to...

226
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:38,283
what four patients undergoing
radiation treatment ingest in,

227
00:14:38,283 --> 00:14:39,983
say, a six-month period.

228
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,573
Somebody's making
a mistake.

229
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,073
This ...

230
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:01,073
this can't be true.

231
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:06,183
I didn't eat or drink iodine 131.

232
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:07,894
We think you
were poisoned.

233
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:12,248
Now, the doctor is
coming in to ...

234
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:13,790
How long?

235
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,490
We think you have
about a week.

236
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:26,768
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:29,841
Not even enough time
for all my hair to fall out.

238
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,041
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:35,054 --> 00:15:36,254
Is there somebody
I can call?

240
00:15:43,312 --> 00:15:45,696
Yes. My parents, my sister.

241
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,175
Okay.

242
00:15:48,975 --> 00:15:50,037
I'll call them.
Never mind.

243
00:15:51,737 --> 00:15:53,982
Now, I'm going to need to ask
you some questions, too.

244
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:56,173
Like who would
want to kill me?

245
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,873
That would be a
good place to start.

246
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,008
I'm going to need a list
of your clients and....

247
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,924
any of the companies that
you filed suit against recently,

248
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,761
and how about enemies.

249
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,243
Well, that's a long list.

250
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:13,350
Did you meet with any
of them yesterday?

251
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,316
I met with
Twin Creeks Power Plant.

252
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,876
Just sued for
plume contamination.

253
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:18,876
They hate me.

254
00:16:19,535 --> 00:16:20,874
Did they bring you
anything to drink?

255
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:23,259
No. But, uh,

256
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:25,141
I had coffee at
my next meeting....

257
00:16:25,141 --> 00:16:28,741
with a nuclear weapons
facility, Elkwood.

258
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,528
They bring you the coffee?

259
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:32,423
No, actually I got it from
a vending machine,

260
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:33,523
and if you keep
interrupting me,

261
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:35,103
I'm never going to get
through my list of enemies.

262
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:35,952
Go on.

263
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:40,159
Right before lunch, I met with
Risher Pharmaceuticals.

264
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,655
They're guilty of unsafe
toxic disposal,

265
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:45,271
misplaced isotopes,
and -this is my favorite

266
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:49,371
--confusing isotopes so patients are 
injected with the wrong dosages.

267
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,851
No meals, no drinks.

268
00:16:51,851 --> 00:16:53,053
Not even a glass of water?

269
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,465
I'd tell you.
Nothing.

270
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,854
How are you feeling?

271
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:00,758
Not very hungry.

272
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:05,234
Yeah, we got threatening
phone calls,

273
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,810
stupid letters --
mostly from other lawyers.

274
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,386
Belle kicks ass.

275
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,896
Yeah, I've seen
these articles.

276
00:17:13,596 --> 00:17:15,666
Does a lot of pro
bono work, huh?

277
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,162
She's helped a lot of people.

278
00:17:18,462 --> 00:17:21,762
Who would do this?
Who is that sick?

279
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,017
Can you tell me what's
in this drawer?

280
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,717
Personal stuff.

281
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,517
Well, do you mind
unlocking it?

282
00:17:41,693 --> 00:17:42,693
Thank you.

283
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:28,894
Chickens?

284
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:33,894
Yes. That's Mary Ann,
Linda and Jean.

285
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,938
You supply the neighbors
with eggs?

286
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:37,770
People pay me what they can.

287
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,390
We okay?

288
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,483
Air's clean.

289
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,137
If there's any
iodine 131 left in there,

290
00:18:43,137 --> 00:18:46,496
it's lost all its potency.
Just let one of your CSIs in.

291
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:48,281
Thank you, gentlemen.

292
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,931
Okay.
Thank you.

293
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,920
Would you mind
putting these on? Okay?

294
00:18:58,617 --> 00:18:59,398
Calleigh.

295
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,905
I, uh, checked all the dishes
in the sink with sulfur.

296
00:19:02,905 --> 00:19:06,352
There was no reaction.
There's no sign of iodine so far.

297
00:19:06,352 --> 00:19:08,999
Okay. 
You collect hourglasses.

298
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:10,999
Yeah.

299
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:21,022
My dad got me this one to remind
me not to work on the weekends.

300
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,432
It lasts for five days.

301
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:35,281
Somebody sent you flowers.

302
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:40,439
From "a friend."

303
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,505
Yeah, sometimes people like
to say thanks anonymously.

304
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:46,755
I don't question
it if it's nice.

305
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,801
Helps to balance out
all the hate mail.

306
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,421
Speaking of, there's a ...

307
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:54,713
there's a nice one from
Newhouse, Getty and Cooly.

308
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,477
Who's Sam Carver?

309
00:19:56,477 --> 00:19:59,110
An angry father lashing out
at the world, not me.

310
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,724
Where are my glasses?

311
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:05,553
Good thing I didn't get that laser 
surgery to correct my nearsightedness.

312
00:20:05,553 --> 00:20:07,189
"If you ever try
to contact us again,

313
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:10,470
I will kill you ...
and that's a promise."

314
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,964
Yeah, he wrote that right
after his oldest son died.

315
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:17,700
It was horrible.

316
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:20,700
I still wanted to fight for Hank.

317
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,696
He's seven now,
and he's doing fine.

318
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:25,201
We worked everything out.

319
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,998
So you did contact him again.

320
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:28,656
And we worked
everything out.

321
00:20:29,456 --> 00:20:32,215
In fact, Janet even leaves
me fresh orange juice...

322
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:35,161
every couple of days to 
celebrate the clean new water.

323
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:37,534
Did she do that yesterday?

324
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:38,552
Yeah.

325
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:39,976
Did you drink it?

326
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,278
Okay.

327
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,678
Calleigh, could you come in
here a minute, please?

328
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:08,801
It's positive for iodine.

329
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:16,740
Recently,

330
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,636
Belle won a class action suit for you
against the power plant for $200,000.

331
00:21:21,636 --> 00:21:24,822
So I guess I'm a little confused as
to why there are still hard feelings.

332
00:21:24,822 --> 00:21:25,970
But there aren't.

333
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,516
Okay.

334
00:21:29,516 --> 00:21:31,956
"If you ever try
to contact us again,

335
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:35,150
I will kill you,
and that's a promise."

336
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,749
She dragged
her feet on the case.

337
00:21:38,354 --> 00:21:39,149
Holding out
for more money.

338
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:42,443
She had a responsibility to 
everyone in the lawsuit, Sam,

339
00:21:42,443 --> 00:21:44,877
not just us.
While our oldest son died.

340
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:47,802
It's true.

341
00:21:47,802 --> 00:21:50,565
We could have used an
early settlement to move,

342
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:52,335
for Michael's last days.

343
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:54,125
But we're in a better
neighborhood now,

344
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,935
and our other son Hank,
he's in a real good school.

345
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,529
One with
wheelchair access.

346
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,763
Okay, the problem,
Mrs. Carver,

347
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:06,011
is that your husband is 
still very angry with Belle.

348
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:07,673
Aren't you, sir?

349
00:22:08,673 --> 00:22:11,134
$200,000.

350
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:15,601
Does that seem like enough
money for a child's life to you?

351
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:18,538
Of course not.

352
00:22:22,438 --> 00:22:24,438
I'm sorry for your loss.

353
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:30,222
I see no holes or striations.

354
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:33,845
But there is something
else we can try.

355
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:37,999
We take the empty orange 
juice container and turn ...

356
00:22:39,999 --> 00:22:42,668
to good old ...

357
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:43,768
H2-0.

358
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:49,470
There you go.

359
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,470
So someone has injected
this with a syringe, haven't they?

360
00:22:55,566 --> 00:22:57,485
Sam Carver shoots a
needle through plastic.

361
00:22:57,485 --> 00:22:59,631
Why not just pour isotopes
directly into the juice?

362
00:22:59,631 --> 00:23:01,396
Because I don't think
it was Sam Carver.

363
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:03,258
I think someone
else injected it.

364
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:04,617
The Carvers are innocent.

365
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,931
The Carvers are innocent, and...

366
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:09,931
we are looking for somebody who
knows their way around a syringe.

367
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:20,674
Eric, you get anything?

368
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:22,287
Seventeen prints so far.

369
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:24,496
No matches on AFIS.
But I did get this.

370
00:23:26,096 --> 00:23:26,916
What is that?

371
00:23:27,116 --> 00:23:27,905
Numbers I hope.

372
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:30,595
I don't know, like from a
credit card or a bank card.

373
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:32,726
Could have come straight
out of the killer's wallet.

374
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:34,903
Could lead us straight
back to him hopefully, huh?

375
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:35,903
Yeah.

376
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:40,063
Looks like sixteen numbers.

377
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:41,967
Eric, your genius knows no bounds.

378
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,374
There you have it.
Nice going.

379
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:47,218
I'll call the credit card company,
see whose cash this is.

380
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:49,334
George Risher?

381
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:51,785
CEO of Risher
Pharmaceuticals.

382
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:52,575
Yeah, I know who he is.

383
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:56,095
I have a class action suit against
him for contaminating groundwater.

384
00:23:56,095 --> 00:23:57,225
1,000 homeowners.

385
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:59,422
I'm asking $128 million.

386
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,958
Hey.
Are you okay?

387
00:24:04,258 --> 00:24:06,658
You know what,
come here.

388
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:12,932
You need to get
some rest now.

389
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:14,709
You need to spend sometime
with friends or family,

390
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:16,405
and let me handle this, okay?

391
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:21,426
Did you know Horatio
was the first CSI?

392
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:23,222
He was...
the what?

393
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:24,993
In Hamlet.

394
00:24:25,493 --> 00:24:28,421
When Hamlet was
poisoned and dying,

395
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:30,842
he asked his 
best friend Horatio...

396
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:33,142
to tell the world
who murdered him.

397
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:39,108
Okay, I'll tell the world.

398
00:24:40,808 --> 00:24:42,978
But first, I'm going
to go talk to Risher,

399
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:45,678
and I'll call you later.

400
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:54,929
Miami Dade police.
We'd like to see George Risher.

401
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,332
May I ask what this is about?

402
00:24:56,332 --> 00:24:58,640
Tell Mr. Risher it's
about Belle King.

403
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,094
You know, if that woman
comes by here again,

404
00:25:00,094 --> 00:25:01,433
I will have to call security.

405
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:03,037
Now, why would
you do that?

406
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:04,846
She's, um ...
a nut case.

407
00:25:04,846 --> 00:25:06,853
She's been driving
my boss crazy.

408
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:10,317
I'll go get Mr. Risher.

409
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:11,717
You do that.

410
00:25:14,717 --> 00:25:17,060
Three blocks from where
Carl Aspen was murdered.

411
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,553
Yeah, three blocks from
where iodine 131 first showed up.

412
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,662
And twenty feet ...

413
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:29,662
Twenty feet from where it's
being distributed as we speak.

414
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:33,982
This is a new lock.

415
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:35,651
How can you tell?

416
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:39,865
See in here?
This is freezer burn.

417
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:44,665
You would spray freon in
to disrupt the lock internally.

418
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:54,786
Maybe Risher's in so much hot
water already he didn't report it.

419
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:57,293
Maybe he staged
a break-in to cover it.

420
00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:00,769
George Risher.
What's this about?

421
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:03,858
This is about your involvement
in a murder, Mr. Risher.

422
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:06,727
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

423
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:09,927
My office.
Thank you.

424
00:26:19,525 --> 00:26:21,167
Lock here is busted, too.

425
00:26:22,387 --> 00:26:23,167
Makes sense.

426
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,327
It's where they keep all
the radioactive material.

427
00:26:25,327 --> 00:26:27,927
Yeah, in the fridge
with their soft drinks.

428
00:26:31,135 --> 00:26:32,135
Oh, god.

429
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:35,822
Can you imagine
drinking in our lab?

430
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,453
Well, it is a wonderful way
to ingest all sorts of chemicals...

431
00:26:39,453 --> 00:26:41,153
and biologicals.

432
00:26:41,585 --> 00:26:43,116
Can you hand me the scale?

433
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:45,383
Yeah.
Anything recognizable?

434
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,859
An earring,
a frito and this.

435
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:51,959
Looks like dirt from a heavy
tread shoe or boot.

436
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:55,318
So, let me get this straight,
Mr. Risher,

437
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:56,507
you did have a break-in,

438
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,609
but you failed to report
it to the police?

439
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:00,668
We needed time
to do an inventory.

440
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:02,057
Figure out what,
if anything was missing.

441
00:27:02,057 --> 00:27:04,543
And something was missing,
wasn't it?

442
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:07,812
Like four or five syringes
with iodine 131.

443
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:09,288
How did you know that?

444
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:13,273
We found a $20 bill on a dead mugger
with your credit card impression on it.

445
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:15,676
This conversation is over.

446
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:20,128
No, it's not.
Not yet. You ...

447
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:22,707
stand to lose $128 million

448
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,027
if Ms. King wins her
suit against you, right?

449
00:27:25,027 --> 00:27:26,479
I'll have security
show you out.

450
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:29,033
It would be convenient
if she disappeared.

451
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,904
Ms. King is playing
David and Goliath.

452
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:34,077
She hasn't a single piece of
solid evidence against us.

453
00:27:34,077 --> 00:27:37,455
As for this dead person with
my money and my medicine,

454
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,403
thank you very much
for solving our break-in.

455
00:27:40,903 --> 00:27:43,055
If I find out that you did this,

456
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:45,255
I'm going to make it
my mission to get you.

457
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:33,358
Progress?

458
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:34,758
Yeah.

459
00:28:35,072 --> 00:28:37,555
The mystery goo we found on
the floor of Risher's lab...

460
00:28:37,555 --> 00:28:38,911
is made up of nitrogen,
phosphoric acid,

461
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:40,966
potassium and methyl sulfide.
So, in other words ...

462
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:41,863
Chicken dung.

463
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,236
Okay, so Risher cuts
through Belle's backyard,

464
00:28:44,236 --> 00:28:45,789
doses her O.J.

465
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:47,980
and then tracks chicken
remnants back to his lab.

466
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,593
Delko ...
It's not that big a deal.

467
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,178
If you would have
thought about it,

468
00:28:51,178 --> 00:28:51,963
you would have come up
with same conclusion.

469
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,520
It's your nose.

470
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,442
You think this could be
from the iodine exposure?

471
00:28:57,442 --> 00:28:59,272
That's probably
stress-related.

472
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:01,643
Beta contamination does
not cause nosebleeds.

473
00:29:01,643 --> 00:29:02,517
That's easy for you to say.

474
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:03,816
You didn't breathe in
radioactive money.

475
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:05,511
You spent a lot of time
in those canals...

476
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:06,933
swimming through
radioactive crap.

477
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:09,559
So I wouldn't be too concerned
about a little nosebleed.

478
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,073
Yeah, and the RM guys gave
you a clean bill of health,

479
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:14,975
and you do get nosebleeds
in high-pressure situations.

480
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,499
Speedle, did you want
to tell us something?

481
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:17,699
I want to show you
something.

482
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:24,648
Now, I got these pictures
from Belle's home office.

483
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,052
That's Risher's place.

484
00:29:26,052 --> 00:29:27,899
And Risher's lab documents.

485
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,495
These are night vision.

486
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:31,840
Yeah, and my guess it's
probably after hours.

487
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,404
Belle shouldn't
have these pictures.

488
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:35,773
Well, she sure couldn't have
taken them without permission.

489
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:38,071
It means the chicken dung
in Risher's office ...

490
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:39,471
could have
come from Belle.

491
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,369
So, if she breaks in,

492
00:29:41,369 --> 00:29:45,369
takes these pictures and
steals radioactive iodine.

493
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:47,193
Okay, I understand
the documents,

494
00:29:47,193 --> 00:29:49,620
but why take the iodine?

495
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,119
To analyze it ...

496
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,374
to prove that Risher
has shabby security.

497
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:55,712
To kill herself.

498
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,527
I mean, maybe she's
a martyr for her cause.

499
00:29:57,527 --> 00:30:00,024
She wouldn't be the first.
Lady does like the press.

500
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,554
I don't agree.

501
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:05,494
But these pictures could
put Belle inside Risher's lab.

502
00:30:05,494 --> 00:30:06,826
And according
to some chickens,

503
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:10,064
right in front of the refrigerator
with missing iodine.

504
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:13,574
H, all of the evidence points to the fact
that Belle took these pictures.

505
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:15,858
I understand,
but something's not right.

506
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:18,958
We're missing something.

507
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:35,098
What are you doing?

508
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:36,862
I'm going to take these
into evidence.

509
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:39,899
Come on, Horatio.

510
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:43,435
I can't win my cases with
illegally obtained documentation.

511
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:46,328
Breaking into that bastard's
lab would be against the law.

512
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:49,090
And besides,
I'm not that brave.

513
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:55,090
We found some film in your office
with pictures of the Risher lab on it.

514
00:30:56,228 --> 00:30:57,665
And?

515
00:30:57,665 --> 00:30:58,994
You want to tell me about it?

516
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:04,050
Do you have sources
on the street?

517
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,350
Well, then, you know.

518
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,002
I can't give up this person.

519
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:10,521
They're helping me
get the bad guys.

520
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:13,521
Okay.

521
00:31:17,568 --> 00:31:18,568
How are you feeling?

522
00:31:21,243 --> 00:31:22,253
Never better.

523
00:31:24,053 --> 00:31:25,997
But you might
want to hurry.

524
00:31:28,997 --> 00:31:29,997
I will.

525
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,391
I looked for reflections --

526
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:47,165
a hand or fingertip captured
holding the document.

527
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:50,279
Anything to tell us who took
these pictures other than Belle.

528
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,597
How'd the shoe
treads turn out?

529
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:54,983
It didn't.
No match.

530
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:56,054
Really?

531
00:31:57,054 --> 00:31:58,557
Guess we were wrong.

532
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:01,617
Hang on a second.

533
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:03,779
Is that the door to the lab?

534
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:06,179
Go tight on that.

535
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:11,392
That's a levered dead bolt.

536
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:14,061
There's no evidence of freon.

537
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:15,799
You got the picture?

538
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:18,941
So that's the old lock ...

539
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:21,327
And that's a new lock, isn't it?

540
00:32:21,327 --> 00:32:24,606
So if she took the pictures she
didn't break in to do it, did she?

541
00:32:24,606 --> 00:32:25,725
Somebody let her in.

542
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:27,849
Somebody let her in.

543
00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:31,102
Which means she's
protecting an insider.

544
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:33,769
You know, when I found the film it
was in a heart-shaped chocolate box.

545
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:35,076
Maybe that's how
they communicated.

546
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:37,221
You also found a camera
in her office, right?

547
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,318
So if the insider was the
one who sent her the film ...

548
00:32:39,318 --> 00:32:41,922
Maybe the insider
took the pictures.

549
00:32:41,922 --> 00:32:42,970
Where's the camera?

550
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,359
It's on its way to the
fingerprint lab.

551
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,359
Call them.

552
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,530
You misled me, Belle.

553
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,730
Didn't you?

554
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,920
You ...

555
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,359
have a source ...

556
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:07,461
inside Risher.

557
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,589
And I want to know
who it is.

558
00:33:14,861 --> 00:33:16,292
He has nothing
to do with this.

559
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:17,423
No?

560
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:18,642
He took the pictures,

561
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:20,216
he knows where they
store the iodine,

562
00:33:20,216 --> 00:33:22,359
he's involved and
I want his name.

563
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,260
He'd never hurt me.

564
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,243
Belle, either you
give me his name,

565
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:29,413
or I'm going
to get it myself.

566
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:30,792
If you expose my source,

567
00:33:32,492 --> 00:33:35,185
my evidence
will be inadmissible...

568
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,785
and it'll ruin my
case against Risher.

569
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:40,766
I think he poisoned you.

570
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,775
I'm one victim.

571
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:51,655
Do you know how many other
people will be killed by Risher?

572
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:56,155
Right now,
my concern is you.

573
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:12,027
There's not a single
fingerprint on this.

574
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,802
It's probably wiped down.

575
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:16,627
Lenses are such a good
place for fingerprints.

576
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:20,849
Why is this blurry?

577
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:24,099
Wait a minute.

578
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,389
This has a diopter on it.

579
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,859
Diopters refer to the
curvature of the lens.

580
00:34:30,259 --> 00:34:31,440
Increase the diopter, ...

581
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,774
... the lens gets thicker,
the curvature greater,

582
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:34,590
redirecting the light,

583
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:38,191
making the image appear
larger and in focus.

584
00:34:38,191 --> 00:34:41,528
Just like putting on a pair of
glasses and this one ...

585
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:43,797
is set for farsightedness.

586
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:45,500
So what?

587
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,794
Belle is nearsighted.

588
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:51,875
I need the Risher employee list
complete with medical records.

589
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:53,697
I'll narrow it down to
farsighted employees.

590
00:34:53,697 --> 00:34:55,059
Okay, I'll call a judge
and get a warrant.

591
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,487
Eric, start taking swabs.

592
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:58,481
To match with what?
We didn't get any DNA off the pencil.

593
00:34:58,481 --> 00:35:00,779
Oh, I think I know
where else to look.

594
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:04,024
The isotopes have
become harmless.

595
00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:08,824
Still, you do realize
this is a long shot.

596
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,351
I know, Alexx.

597
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:13,745
I have no idea if the lead is
compromising the epithelials.

598
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,309
All I need is one.

599
00:35:16,209 --> 00:35:18,813
Like I said,
long shot.

600
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:23,113
Must have been
quite a fight.

601
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:30,646
'cause it looks like I have
a pretty nice hunk in there.

602
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,557
So we have a killer.

603
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:37,221
Horatio?

604
00:35:37,221 --> 00:35:39,502
Fourteen employees
at Risher are farsighted.

605
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:42,502
Only one with this DNA,
though.

606
00:35:52,631 --> 00:35:54,193
Got it.
I got the match.

607
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:58,067
I'm sorry this is
the employee ...

608
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:00,616
Miami Dade Police.
Get out of the way, ma'am.

609
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:05,119
Hey!
Hey!

610
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,764
That's private property!

611
00:36:08,764 --> 00:36:10,439
You have the right
to remain silent.

612
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:14,239
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

613
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:32,245
We found your skin underneath
the victim's fingernails.

614
00:36:32,245 --> 00:36:35,418
These are called alleles.
There's a 100% match to you.

615
00:36:35,418 --> 00:36:36,491
I work in medicine.

616
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:37,953
I know about DNA.

617
00:36:37,953 --> 00:36:39,166
Do you?
Yeah.

618
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:42,816
It's an exciting field, isn't it?
Yeah.

619
00:36:43,116 --> 00:36:45,094
But that's not what we're
here to talk about, Parker.

620
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:48,437
We're here to talk about the
fact that you got mugged...

621
00:36:48,437 --> 00:36:50,937
the night you were
planning your own murder.

622
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:54,730
Don't hurt me!
I got money, I got money.

623
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,346
I got money.
Here.

624
00:36:57,646 --> 00:36:58,852
That's nothing,
that's nothing.

625
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:01,645
What's this?

626
00:37:01,645 --> 00:37:02,904
Some grade-a smack?

627
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:05,646
I gave him my money.

628
00:37:05,946 --> 00:37:09,346
Money that you used from
the Risher coffee run, right?

629
00:37:09,346 --> 00:37:10,691
He wouldn't back off.

630
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:12,991
Self-defense.

631
00:37:12,991 --> 00:37:14,986
Oh, yeah, self-defense.

632
00:37:15,386 --> 00:37:19,970
You were trying to defend the
other four syringes of iodine 131.

633
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,580
Snapped his neck,
left the cash...

634
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,680
and took your syringes
over to Belle's.

635
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:35,631
Now, Parker,
I have a question for you.

636
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,251
Do you have
a crush on Belle?

637
00:37:40,251 --> 00:37:43,844
Because, see, once we do
a full handwriting analysis,

638
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,184
I'm certain we're
going to get a match...

639
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:49,015
between your
office stationary...

640
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:52,015
and the anonymous
flower card.

641
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:00,788
She, uh ...

642
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:02,626
tricked me ...

643
00:38:03,188 --> 00:38:04,588
into doing things for her.

644
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:09,231
Thanks.

645
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:13,818
Things like breaking into
Risher to gather evidence.

646
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:14,818
That kind of thing?

647
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:29,247
She pretended to like me
to get what she wanted.

648
00:38:35,974 --> 00:38:38,697
I told her how I felt about
her and she just ...

649
00:38:38,697 --> 00:38:39,897
she just cares
about sick people.

650
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,026
Just cared about
sick people.

651
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:57,426
So you spiked her orange
juice to get her attention.

652
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:03,115
I loved her.

653
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:06,415
Enough to love
her to death?

654
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,116
I thought if she were dead ...

655
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:25,387
I could forget about her.

656
00:39:27,287 --> 00:39:28,672
Well, that is a plan.

657
00:39:29,672 --> 00:39:31,556
But it didn't turn out
that way, did it?

658
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:38,556
You'll have the next fifty years
in a 6x6 cell to work on it.

659
00:39:56,472 --> 00:39:57,472
Belle.

660
00:40:06,264 --> 00:40:07,464
You were right.

661
00:40:12,158 --> 00:40:13,340
About what?

662
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,340
Your pictures of Risher
confirm that he's dirty.

663
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,345
So he was
dumping waste.

664
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:29,312
My evidence was
obtained with a warrant.

665
00:40:30,612 --> 00:40:33,612
Now I can prove it in court.
How about that?

666
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:37,177
Horatio?

667
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:43,836
Tell the world.

668
00:40:46,136 --> 00:40:47,193
I will.

669
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:51,593
Horatio?

670
00:40:57,562 --> 00:40:58,662
Thank you.

671
00:41:06,353 --> 00:41:07,353
Thank you.

672
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:36,550
