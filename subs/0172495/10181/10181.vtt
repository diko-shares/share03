1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,680
We have someone seated
at this table already.

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:03,847
Would you mind...

3
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:07,067
I want to sit here for the fireworks.

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:10,526
This Inn is for everybody.

5
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:12,851
That is alright!

6
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:15,685
I would like a new friend.

7
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:16,894
I don't need friends,

8
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:20,280
I will book this Inn for the night.

9
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:22,937
But...

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,277
I've been following that tribe of
merchants for a long time,

11
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:41,944
don't you dare touch them.

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,195
Since I have the chance  to
meet Qinglong today,

13
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,279
I, the Judge of the Desert,
must see how great he is.

14
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:52,281
Before it goes down,
I will beat you.

15
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,542
Go!

16
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:27,918
- Good!
- Qinglong.

17
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:29,210
Are you alright?

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,294
No problem!

19
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:40,422
Before this bowl stops spinning,

20
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,340
I will beat you...

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,257
- as well.
- Good!

22
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:10,350
Don't move!

23
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:21,270
Qinglong.

24
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,692
Why don't you draw your sword?

25
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,818
I have no wish to fight you.

26
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:41,985
But I will tell you this,

27
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,705
they have a thousand taels of gold.

28
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,361
They are numerous in numbers

29
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:49,988
but we can work together.

30
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,488
Here is the map to the post.

31
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,366
Let an arrow be our signal

32
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:00,616
to attack together.

33
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:04,076
How will we split it?

34
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,451
I don't want any of it,

35
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:08,786
I want something else from them.

36
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:15,622
Why should I trust you?

37
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:29,668
If the plan fails,

38
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:32,086
I'll end my own life.

39
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,842
We Sky Eagles have our own rules.

40
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:53,260
The day

41
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,427
we rob something that is worth
giving up our lives for,

42
00:03:56,146 --> 00:03:58,636
that is the day we turn into
righteous bandits.

43
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:03,971
Qinglong...

44
00:04:04,274 --> 00:04:06,098
What are you after?

45
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:28,480
My dignity!

46
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:35,733
- Let's go.
- Go!

47
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,982
Yes sir.

48
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:58,961
Why didn't you leave just now?

49
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:03,645
Didn't you tell me to stay near you?

50
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,071
My fiance is a trader in
Sky Eagle enclave.

51
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:14,272
He ask me to come here
during the

52
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:15,774
Mid Autumn festival to watch
the fireworks.

53
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:18,883
He said it's beautiful here!

54
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,452
The big desert scenery,

55
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,703
wide blue sky all over.

56
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,489
I'm sure I'll like it.

57
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:34,044
He said if I were ever to come,
I should stay here with him.

58
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,629
He said he would make up for
everything he has ever done.

59
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:40,672
I'm really here now,

60
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,965
but with a Jinyiwei instead.

61
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:03,512
Here is the money that I owe you.

62
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:08,515
Go look for your fiance tomorrow.

63
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,016
You want me to go back to him?

64
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:29,897
Am I of no use to you now?

65
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,399
Yes!

66
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,579
I took advantage of you
and am now finished.

67
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:12,297
Why are you here alone?

68
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,736
I do not have family,

69
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:20,727
who am I here with if it
weren't with myself?

70
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:26,103
I am fortunate to have your
company tonight.

71
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,980
Many are after me,

72
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:34,106
but their luck runs out.

73
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:38,941
And I am always the only one left.

74
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:40,858
That is depressing.

75
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,901
The ones after you don't
have it easy either.

76
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,903
The more you understand the
one you are looking for,

77
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,736
the more you will treat him
as a friend.

78
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,321
Watching your friend goes down,

79
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,123
how is that for depressing?

80
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,072
The worst occassion,

81
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,408
was when I killed my own brother.

82
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,118
Do not worry,

83
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:12,202
your nightmare will soon end.

84
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,787
I am mentally prepared each day,

85
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,454
that before I go down

86
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,664
I must complete what I have
set out to do.

87
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:23,040
Whomever stands in my way,

88
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:26,290
no matter friend or foe...

89
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,250
will have to go down first.

90
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:34,377
Fireworks have started!

91
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:31,980
Take this inside.

92
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,439
Where did you kids come from?

93
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:35,773
Do not play here.

94
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,440
Outside! Outside!

95
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,608
Big sister, our money.

96
00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:47,026
Thank you, big sister.

97
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:19,163
Captain, it must have been
a long trip for you.

98
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:23,247
Assisting Prince Qing to acquire
the three districts,

99
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:26,498
took me a lot of effort.

100
00:13:27,175 --> 00:13:29,416
My deepest gratitude, Sir Jia.

101
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,291
I thank you on behalf of Prince Qing.

102
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,340
Has Sir Jia brought

103
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,424
what we wanted?

104
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:27,978
Is the Scroll here?

105
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:30,728
I too must take a routine
look at it.

106
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:34,438
Sir Jia, before I left...

107
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:38,648
Prince Qing made some amends
to the Scroll.

108
00:14:38,992 --> 00:14:41,107
It is Mid-Autumn Festival,

109
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:46,818
our first Emperor made his move
on this day

110
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,111
and founded the Ming Dynasty.

111
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:54,237
Prince Qing wants,

112
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:58,905
the Imperial Seal of Approval
on this Scroll,

113
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,562
so that he can come forth
into the city.

114
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,989
What rubbish!
This is a blatant revolt.

115
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,647
You dare not to be understanding?

116
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:11,326
Aren't you afraid

117
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,618
of being beheaded?

118
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:17,317
Xuan Wu, take the Seal!

119
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,404
Xuan Wu, you...

120
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,790
Sir Jia...

121
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,040
Did you not once say,

122
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:31,749
when people see the glory of
your success,

123
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:34,833
they will forget the sinister nature
of your means.

124
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:36,960
I work for Prince Qing now.

125
00:15:37,678 --> 00:15:41,805
Sir Jia, thank you for teaching
me that.

126
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:07,970
Ready!

127
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:15,014
Shoot!

128
00:16:34,823 --> 00:16:37,064
Tell our men to be on guard
and secure this place.

129
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:39,106
Kill anyone who comes in.

130
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:39,731
Yes!

131
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:43,816
Captain, please hand me the Scroll,

132
00:16:44,243 --> 00:16:45,983
we should stamp it with the Seal.

133
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,026
Kill!

134
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,133
Kill--

135
00:18:02,478 --> 00:18:05,636
Here comes the Sky Eagles!

136
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:50,776
Qinglong--

137
00:18:51,078 --> 00:18:51,860
Captain!

138
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,653
This is the family business
of the Jinyiwei.

139
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,195
Whomever stands in my way today,

140
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,737
will go down.

141
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:10,116
I am stronger than anyone of you,

142
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,992
am I wrong to pursue what I want?

143
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,379
I know...

144
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:18,578
You have always treated me
like a brother,

145
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,870
but did you not

146
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,788
kill your own brother too?

147
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:33,510
Yes, and that has left me

148
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:36,541
a life more painful than death.

149
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,209
The suffering...

150
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:44,711
is an unwakeable nightmare
that will never end.

151
00:19:45,514 --> 00:19:48,630
You will not want a life like mine.

152
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:55,142
Don't worry. On the journey of
death you'll not be alone.

153
00:19:57,178 --> 00:20:00,851
I'll accompanied you once
my work is done here.

154
00:20:00,852 --> 00:20:01,717
Kill him.

155
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:11,470
I hate bullies.

156
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,638
Judge of the Desert--

157
00:20:13,273 --> 00:20:15,013
I thought you only knew how to rob.

158
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:17,181
I love to rob,

159
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,514
but I love to fight even more.

160
00:21:19,588 --> 00:21:20,963
Take this.

161
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,254
Your carriage is behind the
guard post.

162
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:52,005
There is food and water, supplies...

163
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:54,173
enough for five days journey.

164
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,549
Here is your gold.

165
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,164
It is all mine?

166
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:02,967
It is all yours.

167
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:05,551
The concept of robbing for anything
other than riches,

168
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:08,969
I really do not understand!

169
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,512
If you're ever up for something
like this again,

170
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,721
remember to inform me.

171
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,723
I will!

172
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:27,840
Leave.

173
00:22:29,778 --> 00:22:31,643
Qinglong--

174
00:22:59,455 --> 00:23:01,404
Leave quickly.

175
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,781
Go without me, leave quickly.

176
00:23:10,418 --> 00:23:11,282
Quickly!

177
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:14,158
Quinglong, I'll count to three.

178
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:17,701
One,

179
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:22,161
Two,

180
00:23:24,756 --> 00:23:26,621
He will not

181
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:28,788
give up the Seal for me.

182
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:29,580
Three!

183
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,297
I'm sorry.

184
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,382
Because of me, you lost the Seal.

185
00:23:58,433 --> 00:24:01,299
Did you not once say that everyone
has a choice?

186
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:07,479
How did she manage to capture you?

187
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:10,844
After I went to find my fiance,

188
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,137
I went back to find you.

189
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:15,013
That is how she got me.

190
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:18,347
Sorry!

191
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:20,806
I shouldn't have asked you
to find him.

192
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,193
I should've personally delivered
you to him.

193
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:49,482
This is where...

194
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,067
we saw Qinglong fight with
the girl from the West.

195
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:55,484
Qinglong lost and she fled in
our carriage.

196
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,610
Brothers from the desert in the
North also saw

197
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:00,819
war drums hoisted by
Prince Qing's palace.

198
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:02,987
A troop of ten thousands were
standing by,

199
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:04,779
ready to attack.

200
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:07,572
At the same time, there were
about three hundred fire shooters

201
00:25:07,624 --> 00:25:09,448
aiming towards the City
of Sky Wolves.

202
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,532
Their intention unknown...

203
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,005
The entire city is trembling in fear.

204
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:26,881
Zhao Shenyan is to be excuted for
losing the Imperial Seal.

205
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:32,665
Qinglong has lost the same item
during his mission in the city.

206
00:25:32,716 --> 00:25:34,040
Then...

207
00:25:34,175 --> 00:25:38,166
it must be the same Seal that
Qinglong has taken back.

208
00:25:45,304 --> 00:25:47,252
It's not only the Seal

209
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:50,587
that Qinglong is after.

210
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:12,761
<i>The fourteenth and the last blade
of the Jinyiwei:</i>

211
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,054
<i>Fulfill your mission or,
failing that, lay down your life.</i>

212
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,124
Taking back the Seal doesn't just
concern you alone.

213
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:30,705
Qinglong, although you are the
best fighter among us,

214
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,455
there is one thing that we excel in

215
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:35,373
and that is we know our way.

216
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:37,259
We know the routes inside and out.

217
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,427
There is no time, so let us help you.

218
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:51,878
Yes!

219
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:00,017
<i>If they stamp the Seal on the
forged Scroll,</i>

220
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:02,215
<i>Prince Qing will be able to take
his men into the city.</i>

221
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:04,424
<i>The people will suffer a long
and painful war.</i>

222
00:28:04,477 --> 00:28:06,592
<i>So before the Seal passes
through the border,</i>

223
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:07,967
<i>we must take it back!</i>

224
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:14,803
For Tuo Tuo to pass through,

225
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,929
she must go through the
City of Sky Wolves.

226
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:18,055
Prince Qing is meticulous,

227
00:28:18,315 --> 00:28:20,013
he will do everything to aid her.

228
00:28:35,904 --> 00:28:37,279
Do you have any idea?

229
00:28:37,446 --> 00:28:38,477
Must draw Tuo Tuo away,

230
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,561
divert their attention and
grabbed the Seal.

231
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:41,198
City of Sky Wolves is famous for
its labyrinthian passage.

232
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,229
I know a shortcut

233
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:44,271
that will enable us to pass them.

234
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:46,564
Brothers, we must hurry!

235
00:28:47,741 --> 00:28:49,826
CITY OF SKY WOLVES

236
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:18,658
Stop!

237
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:38,707
Xuan Wu,

238
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:39,832
you deliver the Seal.

239
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:41,739
I will take care of Qinglong.

240
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:50,138
Let's go!

241
00:30:07,061 --> 00:30:09,093
Check it out!

242
00:30:13,083 --> 00:30:16,313
HERE LIES THE BODY
OF XUAN WU

243
00:30:23,275 --> 00:30:25,390
Have the fire shooters dismount
and chase.

244
00:30:26,067 --> 00:30:27,182
Yes!

245
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:07,529
- Go after them.
- Yes!

246
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,241
Let us split up here.

247
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:23,617
- Go!
- Yes!

248
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:26,347
Fire!

249
00:32:40,405 --> 00:32:41,863
Cease fire.

250
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:00,318
Retreat!

251
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,449
Charge...

252
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:21,159
Charge...

253
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:28,306
The Seal is here.

254
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:37,987
I cannot turn back now.

255
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,978
Kill me!

256
00:34:46,115 --> 00:34:48,146
Brother...

257
00:35:07,997 --> 00:35:09,779
Qinglong, go to Qao Hua quickly.

258
00:35:09,914 --> 00:35:11,780
We will handle this here.

259
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,287
Qinglong fooled you into
dying for him.

260
00:35:44,427 --> 00:35:48,709
Here comes the Sky Eagles!

261
00:35:53,512 --> 00:35:56,076
Judge--

262
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,894
Judge...

263
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,603
I said scram!

264
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:46,146
Scram!

265
00:38:43,737 --> 00:38:45,561
Tell Qinglong for me,

266
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,646
if you see me upon this sandy
horizon again,

267
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:51,396
do not be over-joyed,

268
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:54,022
if it is she that you see,

269
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:58,065
please don't grieved for me.

270
00:39:02,244 --> 00:39:04,568
After here, you can pass
through the border.

271
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:15,322
Aren't you coming with me?

272
00:39:17,124 --> 00:39:20,240
The road for a Jinyiwei is short.

273
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,407
Mine has come to its end today.

274
00:39:25,835 --> 00:39:28,201
You told me,

275
00:39:29,754 --> 00:39:31,869
we would deliver the Seal together.

276
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:35,412
I want you to leave with me.

277
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,288
I promise you...

278
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:43,998
From now on, if you need me...

279
00:39:44,467 --> 00:39:47,791
you only need to ring the bell
on your wrist,

280
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,876
and I will be there for you to
beat off all the baddies.

281
00:40:03,181 --> 00:40:05,880
Let me tell you a secret.

282
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:09,340
That day,

283
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,591
after I saw my fiance...

284
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,592
I came back for you.

285
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:18,677
I wanted to tell you

286
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:21,886
I have declined the proposal.

287
00:40:32,025 --> 00:40:33,599
Whatever you tell me to do,

288
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:37,600
I will do it!

289
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,893
No matter if you are lying to me,

290
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,103
or not...

291
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,513
I want to wait for you!

292
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:03,037
Qiao Hua...

293
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,473
<i>Help me send the Seal to
the General.</i>

294
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,325
<i>After I take care of Tuo Tuo,
I will come back immediately.</i>

295
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,127
<i>Wait for me!</i>

296
00:46:25,438 --> 00:46:27,762
Before I complete my task,

297
00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:31,148
whomever that stands in my way,

298
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,473
no matter friend or foe

299
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:38,484
will have to go down first.

300
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:35,764
<i>In the end, I safely delivered the
Seal to General of the West,</i>

301
00:48:36,441 --> 00:48:38,973
<i>just like I promised Qinglong.</i>

302
00:48:39,609 --> 00:48:41,474
<i>The conspiracy was found out,</i>

303
00:48:41,526 --> 00:48:44,892
<i>but Prince Qing killed himself
before the execution.</i>

304
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:46,560
<i>It is rumored...</i>

305
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:49,560
<i>that Prince Qing has never
cried in his entire life.</i>

306
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,061
<i>But upon hearing the death
of Tuo Tuo,</i>

307
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,437
<i>he shed a tear.</i>

308
00:48:55,364 --> 00:48:57,522
<i>The people were most thrilled</i>

309
00:48:57,573 --> 00:48:59,946
<i>- that the Emperor held court again.
- Father! - Shouzheng!</i>

310
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,850
<i>Sir Zhao was released,</i>

311
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,189
<i>and was restored to his
previous position.</i>

312
00:49:04,948 --> 00:49:06,695
<i>With such a righteous official's,</i>

313
00:49:07,434 --> 00:49:09,426
<i>the people'll have contentment again.</i>

314
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:14,391
Brother Huang, this way.

315
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:16,661
Yes, boss!

316
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:18,908
Prepare the food fast,

317
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,159
must continue after lunch!

318
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:21,824
- Hurry, hurry!
- Yes!

319
00:49:24,166 --> 00:49:25,541
<i>Before father passed
away he said,</i>

320
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,650
<i>For all that is just and
fair in the world,</i>

321
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:32,329
<i>Justice Escorts must remain open.</i>

322
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:35,722
<i>He also let me know a secret,</i>

323
00:49:36,441 --> 00:49:40,932
<i>that his wine is not for bruises
and wounds,</i>

324
00:49:41,297 --> 00:49:43,412
<i>but for him to remember...</i>

325
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:45,954
<i>the sweet memories of the past.</i>

326
00:49:50,384 --> 00:49:52,457
<i>When I drink this wine,</i>

327
00:49:52,717 --> 00:49:55,875
<i>I am reminded of a friend
I met in the desert.</i>

328
00:49:56,052 --> 00:49:58,459
<i>I feel very fortunate to
have met him.</i>

329
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:00,710
<i>Because I am witness that the Judge</i>

330
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:05,097
<i>has turned from bad for the good.</i>

331
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:19,716
<i>Of course, I will also think of him.</i>

332
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:23,342
<i>And the roads we have
traveled together.</i>

333
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,972
I may not know the ways
of the world...

334
00:50:55,614 --> 00:50:58,178
<i>He once told me that I only need
to ring a bell on my wrist,</i>

335
00:50:58,532 --> 00:51:00,981
<i>and he will appear.</i>

336
00:51:02,283 --> 00:51:05,774
<i>Whatever he tells me to do,
I will do it.</i>

337
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,942
<i>No matter if he's lying to me
or not.</i>

338
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:51,029
<i>It is fortunate to have hope!</i>
