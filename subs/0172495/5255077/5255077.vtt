1
00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.448
Sir.

2
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:19.825
General.

3
00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:21.827
General.

4
00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.121
General.

5
00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:26.498
Sir.

6
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:28.959
General.

7
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:31.753
Sir.

8
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.437
Lean and hungry.

9
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.317
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

10
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:57.320
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

11
00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:02.075
Will they fight, sir?

12
00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.618
We shall know soon enough.

13
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.246
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

14
00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.665
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

15
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.754
- The danger to the cavalry…
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

16
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.514
They say no.

17
00:04:50.457 --> 00:04:53.001
People should know
when they're conquered.

18
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.263
Would you, Quintus?

19
00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.474
Would I?

20
00:05:24.241 --> 00:05:25.659
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

21
00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.202
Strength and Honor.

22
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.710
At my signal, unleash hell.

23
00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.943
Load the catapults.

24
00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.779
Infantry form up for advance.

25
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:06.700
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

26
00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.243
- Nock!
- Nock!

27
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:33.393
Fratres!

28
00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.312
- Maximus!
- Maximus!

29
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.859
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

30
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:45.405
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

31
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:49.451
Hold the line! Stay with me!

32
00:06:49.534 --> 00:06:52.203
If you find yourself alone,

33
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:55.290
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

34
00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.668
do not be troubled.

35
00:06:59.502 --> 00:07:03.131
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

36
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.968
Brothers,

37
00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.180
what we do in life

38
00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.933
echoes in eternity.

39
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.692
Pull!

40
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:40.335
Cohorts ready, sir!

41
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:53.390
Archers, ignite!

42
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.267
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

43
00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.818
Archers, draw!

44
00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.656
Loose!

45
00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.770
All right, men, ready!

46
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:48.528
Hold the line!

47
00:08:56.786 --> 00:08:58.913
Loose!

48
00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.457
Reload!

49
00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.505
Hold the line!

50
00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:09.924
- Draw!
- Loose!

51
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:14.304
Stay with me!

52
00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:21.853
Stay with me!

53
00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.717
Roma victor!

54
00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.664
Roma victor!

55
00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:12.000
Do you think he's really dying?

56
00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:15.420
He's been dying for 10 years.

57
00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:19.966
If he weren't really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

58
00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:21.801
Maybe he just misses us.

59
00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.470
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if..

60
00:13:24.554 --> 00:13:25.847
Peace, Commodus.

61
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.223
After two weeks on the road,

62
00:13:27.307 --> 00:13:29.976
your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.

63
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.820
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

64
00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:46.409
He will name me.

65
00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.915
The first thing I shall do when...

66
00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:58.963
Is honor him with games
worthy of His Majesty.

67
00:13:59.047 --> 00:14:03.926
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

68
00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:07.388
Your Highness?

69
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.186
We seem to be almost there, sir.

70
00:14:19.776 --> 00:14:21.569
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

71
00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:25.323
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

72
00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.617
The wounded are still coming in.

73
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.327
My horse.

74
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.079
My lord.

75
00:14:34.624 --> 00:14:35.708
Kiss?

76
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.164
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

77
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.044
Let us hope, for the last time.

78
00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:22.755
There's no one left to fight, sire.

79
00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:25.466
There is always someone I left to fight.

80
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.469
<i>How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?</i>

81
00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:35.476
Let me go home.

82
00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:37.645
Ah!

83
00:15:38.062 --> 00:15:39.272
Home.

84
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.625
They honor you, Caesar.

85
00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:02.503
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

86
00:16:25.588 --> 00:16:28.258
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

87
00:16:29.926 --> 00:16:31.719
You have missed the war.

88
00:16:31.803 --> 00:16:34.013
Father, congratulations.

89
00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:36.891
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

90
00:16:36.975 --> 00:16:38.643
Save the bulls.

91
00:16:38.726 --> 00:16:41.187
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

92
00:16:41.604 --> 00:16:43.940
- General.
- Highness.

93
00:16:44.941 --> 00:16:48.528
Rome salutes you,
and II embrace you as a brother.

94
00:16:48.611 --> 00:16:50.405
It has been too long, my old friend.

95
00:16:50.488 --> 00:16:51.948
Highness.

96
00:16:52.031 --> 00:16:54.617
Here, Father. Take my arm.

97
00:16:56.202 --> 00:16:59.414
I think it is time for me to leave.

98
00:17:14.554 --> 00:17:17.890
So much for the glory of Rome.

99
00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:48.731
Magnificent battle.

100
00:19:12.672 --> 00:19:14.382
General. Still alive?

101
00:19:14.465 --> 00:19:15.758
Still alive.

102
00:19:15.842 --> 00:19:17.468
The gods must have a sense of humor.

103
00:19:17.552 --> 00:19:20.221
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

104
00:19:20.304 --> 00:19:23.182
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

105
00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:26.352
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

106
00:19:26.978 --> 00:19:30.314
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

107
00:19:30.398 --> 00:19:34.026
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

108
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.195
- Here he is.
- Highness.

109
00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:38.448
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

110
00:19:38.531 --> 00:19:41.409
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear,

111
00:19:41.492 --> 00:19:45.079
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll
say is, "Republic, republic, republic."

112
00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:47.832
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

113
00:19:47.915 --> 00:19:50.793
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

114
00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:53.087
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

115
00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:55.798
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

116
00:19:56.238 --> 00:19:57.489
A soldier has the advantage

117
00:19:57.572 --> 00:20:00.992
of being able to
look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

118
00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:05.122
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

119
00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:08.291
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

120
00:20:18.135 --> 00:20:19.594
Maximus.

121
00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:23.140
I'm going to need good men like you.

122
00:20:25.267 --> 00:20:27.853
How may I be of service, Highness?

123
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:30.981
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

124
00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:34.359
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.

125
00:20:34.443 --> 00:20:39.281
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

126
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:42.826
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

127
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:45.996
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

128
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.754
Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.

129
00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:58.049
<i>Home? Well, no one's earned it more.</i>

130
00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:03.388
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

131
00:21:05.474 --> 00:21:08.018
Lucilia's here. Did you know?

132
00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.479
She's not forgotten you.

133
00:21:11.771 --> 00:21:14.107
And now, you're the great man.

134
00:21:26.369 --> 00:21:28.872
If only you had been born a man,

135
00:21:29.956 --> 00:21:32.209
what a Caesar you would have made.

136
00:21:33.877 --> 00:21:35.337
Father.

137
00:21:41.384 --> 00:21:43.386
You would have been strong.

138
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.681
I wonder, would you have been just?

139
00:21:47.474 --> 00:21:50.143
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

140
00:21:52.145 --> 00:21:53.647
How was your journey?

141
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:57.526
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

142
00:21:58.068 --> 00:22:00.695
I need your help. With your brother.

143
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:02.781
Of course.

144
00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:05.033
He loves you. He always has.

145
00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.244
And

146
00:22:09.162 --> 00:22:12.332
he will need you now, more than ever.

147
00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:19.256
Enough of politics.

148
00:22:19.548 --> 00:22:22.509
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter,

149
00:22:23.051 --> 00:22:25.470
and I am a good father.

150
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:33.728
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

151
00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:48.243
Good morning to you.

152
00:23:01.423 --> 00:23:03.925
I need three more horses.

153
00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:15.937
One! Two! Three!

154
00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:17.981
Four!

155
00:23:18.064 --> 00:23:20.275
One! Two!

156
00:23:36.499 --> 00:23:38.460
You sent for me, Caesar?

157
00:23:43.214 --> 00:23:46.092
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

158
00:23:47.135 --> 00:23:48.845
Why are we here?

159
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.724
For the glory of the empire, sire.

160
00:23:53.141 --> 00:23:54.225
Yes.

161
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:58.229
Yes, I remember.

162
00:24:01.316 --> 00:24:03.568
Do you see that map, Maximus?

163
00:24:04.361 --> 00:24:06.905
That is the world which I created.

164
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:09.366
For 25 years,

165
00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:13.828
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

166
00:24:15.205 --> 00:24:19.000
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

167
00:24:19.084 --> 00:24:21.544
Four years of peace in 20.

168
00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:23.338
And for what?

169
00:24:30.762 --> 00:24:34.599
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

170
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.143
Caesar, your life…

171
00:24:37.227 --> 00:24:39.854
Please. Please don't call me that.

172
00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:42.357
Come. Please.

173
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:44.526
Come sit.

174
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.071
Let us talk together now,

175
00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:51.116
very simply, as men.

176
00:24:51.741 --> 00:24:53.618
Well, Maximus,

177
00:24:55.954 --> 00:24:57.163
talk.

178
00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:03.128
Five thousand of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

179
00:25:03.211 --> 00:25:04.963
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

180
00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:06.548
Two thousand will
never leave this place.

181
00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:09.801
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

182
00:25:09.884 --> 00:25:11.511
And what would you believe?

183
00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:15.473
They fought for you and for Rome.

184
00:25:15.557 --> 00:25:17.350
<i>And what is Rome, Maximus?</i>

185
00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:21.938
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

186
00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:25.984
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

187
00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:27.986
Yet you have never been there.

188
00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:30.530
You have not seen what it has become.

189
00:25:30.613 --> 00:25:33.700
I am dying, Maximus.

190
00:25:34.325 --> 00:25:35.618
When a man sees his end,

191
00:25:35.702 --> 00:25:38.747
He wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

192
00:25:39.873 --> 00:25:43.001
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

193
00:25:43.084 --> 00:25:45.420
Will I be known as the philosopher?

194
00:25:45.503 --> 00:25:46.963
The warrior?

195
00:25:47.255 --> 00:25:48.715
The tyrant?

196
00:25:50.216 --> 00:25:54.846
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

197
00:25:55.805 --> 00:25:58.224
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

198
00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:01.060
You could only whisper it.

199
00:26:01.144 --> 00:26:04.272
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,

200
00:26:04.355 --> 00:26:06.149
it was so fragile.

201
00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:10.153
And I fear that it will not survive
the winter.

202
00:26:11.654 --> 00:26:13.072
Maximus,

203
00:26:14.073 --> 00:26:16.993
let us whisper now,

204
00:26:17.243 --> 00:26:18.953
together, you and I.

205
00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:21.206
You have a son.

206
00:26:22.707 --> 00:26:24.584
Tell me about your home.

207
00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:33.676
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

208
00:26:35.053 --> 00:26:36.805
A very simple place.

209
00:26:37.263 --> 00:26:40.183
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

210
00:26:40.266 --> 00:26:43.770
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day,

211
00:26:44.521 --> 00:26:46.439
jasmine in the evening.

212
00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:50.652
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

213
00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:53.822
Figs, apples, pears.

214
00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:57.450
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

215
00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:00.912
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

216
00:27:00.995 --> 00:27:03.248
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

217
00:27:03.331 --> 00:27:04.958
He wants to be one of them.

218
00:27:05.041 --> 00:27:06.876
When was the last time
you were home?

219
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.046
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

220
00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:15.009
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

221
00:27:16.678 --> 00:27:18.388
Worth fighting for.

222
00:27:21.266 --> 00:27:23.351
There is one more duty

223
00:27:23.935 --> 00:27:26.688
that I ask of you before you go home.

224
00:27:28.565 --> 00:27:30.733
What would you have me do, Caesar?

225
00:27:30.817 --> 00:27:34.404
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

226
00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:38.575
I will empower you to one end alone,

227
00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:42.620
to give power back
to the people of Rome,

228
00:27:42.954 --> 00:27:46.040
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

229
00:27:52.297 --> 00:27:55.925
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

230
00:27:57.302 --> 00:27:59.220
With all my heart, no.

231
00:28:01.764 --> 00:28:03.558
Maximus,

232
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.061
that is why it must be you.

233
00:28:07.145 --> 00:28:09.230
But surely a prefect, a senator,

234
00:28:09.314 --> 00:28:11.983
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

235
00:28:12.066 --> 00:28:15.069
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

236
00:28:20.074 --> 00:28:23.703
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

237
00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:27.290
You have known that
since you were young.

238
00:28:27.373 --> 00:28:29.334
Commodus cannot rule.

239
00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:31.753
He must not rule.

240
00:28:33.296 --> 00:28:36.090
You are the son that I should have had.

241
00:28:38.635 --> 00:28:41.638
Commodus will accept my decision.

242
00:28:43.932 --> 00:28:48.728
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

243
00:28:53.608 --> 00:28:55.193
I need some time, sire.

244
00:28:55.276 --> 00:28:56.694
Yes.

245
00:28:56.778 --> 00:29:00.365
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

246
00:29:01.449 --> 00:29:03.618
Now embrace me as my son.

247
00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:09.749
And bring an old man another blanket.

248
00:29:25.974 --> 00:29:28.476
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

249
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.063
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

250
00:29:32.313 --> 00:29:35.525
Many things. Not everything.

251
00:29:38.444 --> 00:29:40.113
Maximus, stop.

252
00:29:43.658 --> 00:29:45.576
Let me see your face.

253
00:29:48.162 --> 00:29:50.832
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.

254
00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:54.085
What did my father want with you?

255
00:29:55.169 --> 00:29:58.131
To wish me well before I leave for home.

256
00:29:58.756 --> 00:30:00.258
You're lying.

257
00:30:00.591 --> 00:30:03.928
I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.

258
00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:06.597
- I never acquired your comfort with it.
- True.

259
00:30:06.681 --> 00:30:08.808
But then you never had to.

260
00:30:09.308 --> 00:30:12.020
Life is more simple for a soldier.

261
00:30:13.771 --> 00:30:16.024
Or do you think me heartless?

262
00:30:17.025 --> 00:30:19.777
I think you have a talent for survival.

263
00:30:25.783 --> 00:30:27.326
Maximus, stop.

264
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.415
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

265
00:30:32.498 --> 00:30:35.001
No. I'm tired from battle.

266
00:30:35.626 --> 00:30:38.379
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

267
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:45.970
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

268
00:30:47.096 --> 00:30:50.516
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

269
00:30:52.685 --> 00:30:54.854
I will always serve Rome.

270
00:30:56.731 --> 00:30:58.566
Do you know,

271
00:30:58.649 --> 00:31:01.152
I still remember you in my prayers.

272
00:31:02.195 --> 00:31:05.073
Oh, yes. I pray.

273
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.955
I was sad to hear of your husband's
death. I mourned him.

274
00:31:14.874 --> 00:31:17.710
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

275
00:31:19.378 --> 00:31:21.756
Yes. LUCIUS.

276
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:25.343
He'll be nearly eight years old.

277
00:31:25.426 --> 00:31:27.720
My son is also nearly eight.

278
00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:32.642
I thank you for your prayers.

279
00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:42.944
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

280
00:31:44.278 --> 00:31:47.824
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

281
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.246
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

282
00:31:54.455 --> 00:31:57.291
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

283
00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:00.628
Ancestors, I honor you,

284
00:32:01.796 --> 00:32:05.133
and Will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

285
00:32:27.989 --> 00:32:29.240
Cicero.

286
00:32:33.828 --> 00:32:34.954
Sir.

287
00:32:39.417 --> 00:32:41.961
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

288
00:32:44.672 --> 00:32:47.258
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

289
00:32:48.009 --> 00:32:50.595
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

290
00:32:53.514 --> 00:32:56.434
We may not be able to go home,
after all.

291
00:33:47.638 --> 00:33:50.433
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

292
00:33:53.602 --> 00:33:55.021
Yes, Father.

293
00:33:56.105 --> 00:33:58.190
You will not be emperor.

294
00:34:01.527 --> 00:34:03.863
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

295
00:34:03.946 --> 00:34:06.490
My powers will pass to Maximus,

296
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.452
to hold in trust,

297
00:34:09.535 --> 00:34:13.247
until the Senate is ready to rule
once more.

298
00:34:14.832 --> 00:34:18.252
Rome is to be a republic again.

299
00:34:20.212 --> 00:34:22.798
- Maximus.
- Yes.

300
00:34:28.894 --> 00:34:31.147
My decision disappoints you?

301
00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.735
You wrote to me once,

302
00:34:38.612 --> 00:34:40.990
listing the four chief virtues.

303
00:34:42.783 --> 00:34:44.160
Wisdom,

304
00:34:44.243 --> 00:34:45.703
justice,

305
00:34:45.786 --> 00:34:47.246
fortitude,

306
00:34:47.663 --> 00:34:49.456
and temperance.

307
00:34:51.584 --> 00:34:54.712
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

308
00:34:55.671 --> 00:34:58.174
But I have other virtues, Father.

309
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.135
Ambition.

310
00:35:01.927 --> 00:35:04.889
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

311
00:35:06.223 --> 00:35:09.351
Resourcefulness, courage.

312
00:35:10.394 --> 00:35:14.690
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

313
00:35:16.358 --> 00:35:19.570
Devotion to my family,

314
00:35:20.696 --> 00:35:22.072
to you.

315
00:35:23.616 --> 00:35:26.368
But none of my virtues were on your list.

316
00:35:28.662 --> 00:35:31.957
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

317
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:33.417
Commodus,

318
00:35:34.335 --> 00:35:36.003
you go too far.

319
00:35:36.795 --> 00:35:39.757
I searched the faces of the gods

320
00:35:40.549 --> 00:35:44.887
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

321
00:35:45.763 --> 00:35:47.806
One kind word,

322
00:35:48.224 --> 00:35:50.100
one full hug,

323
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:53.938
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight,

324
00:35:55.105 --> 00:35:58.651
would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.

325
00:36:01.278 --> 00:36:03.113
What is it in me you hate so much?

326
00:36:03.197 --> 00:36:05.199
Shh… Commodus.

327
00:36:06.242 --> 00:36:08.369
All I've ever wanted

328
00:36:08.661 --> 00:36:12.915
was to live up to you, Caesar.

329
00:36:14.166 --> 00:36:16.794
- Father.
- Commodus,

330
00:36:21.257 --> 00:36:23.342
your faults as a son

331
00:36:24.343 --> 00:36:27.638
is my failure as a father.

332
00:36:38.357 --> 00:36:39.817
Come.

333
00:36:43.404 --> 00:36:44.863
Father.

334
00:36:59.795 --> 00:37:02.464
I would butcher the whole world,

335
00:37:03.382 --> 00:37:05.843
if you would only have loved me!

336
00:37:43.505 --> 00:37:46.633
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

337
00:37:52.097 --> 00:37:53.891
Lament with me, brother.

338
00:37:55.017 --> 00:37:56.977
Our great father is dead.

339
00:38:23.712 --> 00:38:25.297
How did he die?

340
00:38:26.548 --> 00:38:29.259
The surgeons say there was no pain.

341
00:38:29.343 --> 00:38:31.428
His breath gave out as he slept.

342
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:42.439
Father.

343
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:47.778
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

344
00:38:49.113 --> 00:38:50.739
Take my hand.

345
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.327
I only offer it once.

346
00:39:09.508 --> 00:39:10.801
Quintus.

347
00:40:01.018 --> 00:40:02.561
Hail, Caesar.

348
00:40:03.479 --> 00:40:06.148
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

349
00:40:06.231 --> 00:40:08.817
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

350
00:40:08.901 --> 00:40:11.111
- Sword.
- Sword.

351
00:40:13.614 --> 00:40:16.533
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

352
00:40:16.617 --> 00:40:19.411
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

353
00:40:19.828 --> 00:40:22.331
The emperor died of natural causes.

354
00:40:24.124 --> 00:40:26.335
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

355
00:40:29.546 --> 00:40:31.757
Please don't fight, Maximus.

356
00:40:33.509 --> 00:40:35.802
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

357
00:40:36.261 --> 00:40:38.013
Ride until dawn,

358
00:40:39.264 --> 00:40:40.807
and then execute him.

359
00:40:40.891 --> 00:40:43.352
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

360
00:40:43.602 --> 00:40:46.522
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

361
00:40:47.606 --> 00:40:50.275
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

362
00:41:15.175 --> 00:41:16.385
Kneel.

363
00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.307
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

364
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:25.477
Whisper to them
that! live only to hold them again.

365
00:41:28.105 --> 00:41:30.524
At least give me a clean death.

366
00:41:32.234 --> 00:41:34.027
A soldier's death.

367
00:41:55.299 --> 00:41:58.468
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

368
00:42:19.197 --> 00:42:20.616
Praetorian!

369
00:43:40.362 --> 00:43:42.280
When was
the last time you were home?

370
00:43:42.364 --> 00:43:45.367
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

371
00:43:46.952 --> 00:43:48.787
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

372
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.248
I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

373
00:43:51.331 --> 00:43:53.792
Whisper to them,
! live only to hold them again.

374
00:43:53.875 --> 00:43:56.294
<i>…with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and arr.</i>

375
00:43:56.378 --> 00:43:59.548
Whisper to them,
! live only to hold them again.

376
00:43:59.631 --> 00:44:01.925
For all else is dust and arr.

377
00:45:01.777 --> 00:45:02.778
Papa!

378
00:47:48.276 --> 00:47:49.778
Don't die.

379
00:47:56.076 --> 00:47:57.744
You'! meet them again.

380
00:47:59.788 --> 00:48:01.081
Not yet.

381
00:48:09.631 --> 00:48:13.385
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

382
00:48:47.752 --> 00:48:49.170
Don't die.

383
00:48:49.921 --> 00:48:52.340
They'll feed you to the lions.

384
00:48:52.424 --> 00:48:54.718
They are worth more than we are.

385
00:49:04.728 --> 00:49:06.187
Better now?

386
00:49:07.313 --> 00:49:09.190
Clean. You see?

387
00:49:39.971 --> 00:49:42.807
Proximo! My old friend.

388
00:49:44.184 --> 00:49:47.270
Every day is a great day
when you are here,

389
00:49:47.687 --> 00:49:51.900
but today is your most fortunate day.

390
00:49:54.486 --> 00:49:58.239
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

391
00:49:58.823 --> 00:50:02.744
They just walk around eating
and not mating.

392
00:50:04.037 --> 00:50:06.956
You sold me queer giraffes.

393
00:50:07.832 --> 00:50:10.376
- Iwant my money back.
- Not a chance.

394
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:16.966
- Do special price for you.
- On what?

395
00:50:19.052 --> 00:50:21.971
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

396
00:50:35.944 --> 00:50:38.738
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

397
00:50:38.822 --> 00:50:41.616
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

398
00:50:41.699 --> 00:50:44.035
You need both, I think.

399
00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:45.328
Get up.

400
00:50:53.294 --> 00:50:54.963
What's your trade?

401
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:56.923
I was a hunter.

402
00:50:57.006 --> 00:51:00.718
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Carthage.

403
00:51:01.511 --> 00:51:02.887
Sit down.

404
00:51:07.016 --> 00:51:09.185
Mark of the legion.

405
00:51:09.269 --> 00:51:10.228
Deserter.

406
00:51:10.311 --> 00:51:12.021
Maybe so, but who cares?

407
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.606
He's a Spaniard.

408
00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:15.650
I take six. For 1,000.

409
00:51:15.733 --> 00:51:19.237
1,000?
The Numidian alone is worth 2,000.

410
00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.406
These slaves are rotten.

411
00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:24.659
It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

412
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.870
I can negotiate.

413
00:51:27.996 --> 00:51:32.167
II give you 2,000,
and 4,000 for the beasts.

414
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:34.377
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

415
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:55.440
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

416
00:51:55.523 --> 00:51:57.442
I am Proximo.

417
00:51:58.151 --> 00:52:00.445
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

418
00:52:00.528 --> 00:52:02.989
which will be the last
of your miserable lives,

419
00:52:03.072 --> 00:52:07.410
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

420
00:52:07.702 --> 00:52:11.039
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

421
00:52:12.248 --> 00:52:15.460
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

422
00:52:16.211 --> 00:52:19.923
And as your mother was there
at your beginning,

423
00:52:20.924 --> 00:52:23.551
so I shall be there at your end.

424
00:52:25.053 --> 00:52:28.056
And when you die, and die you shall,

425
00:52:28.973 --> 00:52:31.893
your transition shall be to the sound of...

426
00:52:36.648 --> 00:52:38.107
Gladiators,

427
00:52:39.234 --> 00:52:40.777
I salute you.

428
00:52:45.531 --> 00:52:46.574
Red.

429
00:52:50.245 --> 00:52:51.579
Yellow.

430
00:52:52.705 --> 00:52:53.998
Yellow.

431
00:53:04.717 --> 00:53:05.843
Good.

432
00:53:06.636 --> 00:53:08.012
- Red.
- Red.

433
00:53:12.934 --> 00:53:14.227
Spaniard.

434
00:53:47.593 --> 00:53:49.929
That's enough for the moment!

435
00:53:50.263 --> 00:53:51.889
His time will come.

436
00:53:54.934 --> 00:53:55.977
Next.

437
00:54:09.255 --> 00:54:10.590
Spaniard,

438
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:13.884
why don't you fight?

439
00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.720
We all have to fight.

440
00:54:15.803 --> 00:54:17.513
Well, I don't fight.

441
00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:21.392
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words,

442
00:54:21.475 --> 00:54:23.352
and speak seven languages.

443
00:54:23.436 --> 00:54:24.478
Good.

444
00:54:25.438 --> 00:54:28.441
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

445
00:54:36.741 --> 00:54:40.077
Perhaps the scribe will be
the one who wins his freedom.

446
00:54:41.078 --> 00:54:42.371
Freedom?

447
00:54:43.456 --> 00:54:45.291
What do I have to do?

448
00:54:45.708 --> 00:54:48.002
You go in the arena and you kill me.

449
00:54:48.085 --> 00:54:49.462
And him,

450
00:54:50.463 --> 00:54:52.173
and the Numidian,

451
00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:53.841
and the deserter.

452
00:54:55.468 --> 00:54:56.886
And 100 more.

453
00:54:56.969 --> 00:54:59.805
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

454
00:55:00.473 --> 00:55:02.224
I can't do that.

455
00:55:03.267 --> 00:55:04.477
No?

456
00:55:10.733 --> 00:55:12.151
But I can.

457
00:55:27.667 --> 00:55:29.877
Is that the sign of your gods?

458
00:55:35.091 --> 00:55:37.176
Will that not anger them?

459
00:55:58.489 --> 00:56:00.157
The gods favor you.

460
00:56:00.533 --> 00:56:02.702
Red is the gods' color.

461
00:56:04.078 --> 00:56:06.247
You will need their help today.

462
00:56:45.619 --> 00:56:47.246
Proximo!

463
00:56:52.585 --> 00:56:54.754
Still leading with the German?

464
00:56:54.837 --> 00:56:56.922
The crowd love a barbarian.

465
00:56:57.381 --> 00:56:59.300
Besides that, he's making me rich.

466
00:56:59.383 --> 00:57:02.011
Has that Numidian fought before?

467
00:57:02.845 --> 00:57:04.430
No, first time.

468
00:57:04.513 --> 00:57:07.475
And that one, laborer, soldier?

469
00:57:07.892 --> 00:57:09.143
He's a Spaniard.

470
00:57:09.226 --> 00:57:12.313
He might as well be a eunuch
for what he brings to the ring.

471
00:57:13.272 --> 00:57:17.485
500 sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

472
00:57:17.568 --> 00:57:21.280
And 1,000, that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

473
00:57:22.782 --> 00:57:25.910
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

474
00:57:27.745 --> 00:57:29.246
It's unethical.

475
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:31.207
What if I make it 2,000?

476
00:57:45.513 --> 00:57:48.557
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

477
00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:51.143
some that you can't fight.

478
00:57:52.478 --> 00:57:55.981
They all say that until they're out there.

479
00:57:58.776 --> 00:57:59.944
Listen.

480
00:58:00.027 --> 00:58:02.947
Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

481
00:58:10.079 --> 00:58:12.790
Thrust this into another man's flesh,

482
00:58:13.207 --> 00:58:15.876
and they will applaud and love you
for that.

483
00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.378
And you,

484
00:58:19.338 --> 00:58:21.298
you may begin to love them

485
00:58:22.132 --> 00:58:23.551
for that.

486
00:58:27.638 --> 00:58:31.141
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

487
00:58:33.686 --> 00:58:35.980
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

488
00:58:37.231 --> 00:58:40.025
but we can decide
how we meet that end,

489
00:58:40.943 --> 00:58:43.445
in order that we are remembered

490
00:58:45.364 --> 00:58:46.615
as men.

491
00:58:46.835 --> 00:58:47.836
Come on!

492
00:58:50.798 --> 00:58:53.050
On the left, draw your shields!

493
00:58:54.134 --> 00:58:56.512
On the right, draw your swords!

494
00:58:56.804 --> 00:58:59.348
Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

495
00:59:00.432 --> 00:59:02.893
Pair them up, red with yellow.

496
00:59:07.898 --> 00:59:09.108
Next!

497
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:16.073
Move!

498
01:02:33.395 --> 01:02:35.481
Usurper!

499
01:02:57.085 --> 01:02:59.796
- Go away!
- You'! I never rule us, Commodus!

500
01:03:30.285 --> 01:03:34.998
He enters Rome like a conquering hero.
But what has he conquered?

501
01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:37.709
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

502
01:03:37.793 --> 01:03:40.045
I think he could do very well.

503
01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:42.339
For Rome, or for you?

504
01:03:48.679 --> 01:03:51.765
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

505
01:03:58.188 --> 01:04:00.232
- Lucius!
- Mother!

506
01:04:02.526 --> 01:04:04.111
Hail, Caesar.

507
01:04:04.194 --> 01:04:05.696
Senators.

508
01:04:09.324 --> 01:04:12.202
Rome greets her new emperor.

509
01:04:12.327 --> 01:04:15.831
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

510
01:04:15.914 --> 01:04:17.791
Thank you, Falco.

511
01:04:17.874 --> 01:04:21.962
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they weren't too expensive.

512
01:04:22.045 --> 01:04:24.047
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.

513
01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:26.633
All Rome rejoices in your return,
Caesar.

514
01:04:26.717 --> 01:04:30.220
There are many matters
that require your attention.

515
01:04:32.681 --> 01:04:35.559
To order, please. To order.

516
01:04:36.018 --> 01:04:37.811
For your guidance, Caesar,

517
01:04:37.894 --> 01:04:40.647
the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols

518
01:04:40.731 --> 01:04:43.817
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city,

519
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:48.030
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,

520
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:52.159
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

521
01:04:52.242 --> 01:04:53.285
So, if Caesar...

522
01:04:56.163 --> 01:04:58.081
Don't you see, Gracchus?

523
01:04:59.458 --> 01:05:01.752
That's the very problem, isn't it?

524
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:04.880
My father spent all his time at study,

525
01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:09.968
at books of learning and philosophy.

526
01:05:10.969 --> 01:05:14.473
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

527
01:05:15.432 --> 01:05:18.644
And all the while,
the people were forgotten.

528
01:05:19.269 --> 01:05:21.480
But the senate is the people, sire,

529
01:05:21.563 --> 01:05:25.108
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

530
01:05:25.776 --> 01:05:29.404
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

531
01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:32.616
Or have such splendid mistresses,
Gaius.

532
01:05:32.699 --> 01:05:34.785
I think I understand my own people.

533
01:05:34.868 --> 01:05:38.372
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us,

534
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:41.416
out of his own extensive experience.

535
01:05:45.295 --> 01:05:46.797
I call it love.

536
01:05:47.422 --> 01:05:50.550
I am their father.
The people are my children.

537
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:53.345
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

538
01:05:53.428 --> 01:05:56.890
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

539
01:06:03.146 --> 01:06:05.816
No, but if you interrupt me again,

540
01:06:07.317 --> 01:06:08.652
I assure you that you shall.

541
01:06:08.735 --> 01:06:11.029
Senator, my brother is very tired.

542
01:06:12.072 --> 01:06:16.243
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

543
01:06:16.827 --> 01:06:21.748
My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

544
01:06:28.839 --> 01:06:31.133
Who are they to lecture me?

545
01:06:31.425 --> 01:06:33.927
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

546
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:36.930
What uses? All they do is talk.

547
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:42.686
It should be just you and me and Rome.

548
01:06:42.769 --> 01:06:46.064
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

549
01:06:46.565 --> 01:06:48.275
Rome has changed.

550
01:06:48.358 --> 01:06:51.361
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

551
01:06:51.695 --> 01:06:53.780
Of course, but leave the people their..

552
01:06:53.864 --> 01:06:55.198
Illusions?

553
01:06:56.867 --> 01:06:58.243
Traditions.

554
01:06:59.161 --> 01:07:01.913
My father's war against the barbarians.

555
01:07:02.539 --> 01:07:06.168
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

556
01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:08.128
The people always love victories.

557
01:07:08.211 --> 01:07:11.882
Why? They didn't see the battles.

558
01:07:13.216 --> 01:07:15.218
What do they care about Germania?

559
01:07:15.302 --> 01:07:17.637
They care about the greatness of Rome.

560
01:07:17.721 --> 01:07:19.639
“The greatness of Rome."

561
01:07:21.558 --> 01:07:23.393
Well, what is that?

562
01:07:26.062 --> 01:07:29.316
It's an idea. Greatness.

563
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:36.490
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

564
01:07:38.575 --> 01:07:40.535
Do you not see, Lucilla?

565
01:07:41.912 --> 01:07:45.874
I will give the people a vision
of Rome, and they'll I love me for it.

566
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.921
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

567
01:08:02.265 --> 01:08:05.602
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

568
01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:59.781
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

569
01:09:08.039 --> 01:09:09.207
Games.

570
01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:14.588
One hundred and fifty days of games.

571
01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:16.590
He's cleverer than I thought.

572
01:09:16.673 --> 01:09:20.218
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

573
01:09:21.052 --> 01:09:23.305
if they weren't so afraid
of his Praetorians.

574
01:09:23.388 --> 01:09:26.182
Fear and wonder.
A powerful combination.

575
01:09:27.642 --> 01:09:30.770
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

576
01:09:30.854 --> 01:09:33.940
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

577
01:09:34.608 --> 01:09:37.736
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

578
01:09:38.361 --> 01:09:41.615
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

579
01:09:42.157 --> 01:09:46.494
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

580
01:09:46.578 --> 01:09:48.622
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

581
01:09:50.582 --> 01:09:52.667
He'll bring them death,

582
01:09:54.377 --> 01:09:56.755
and they will love him for it.

583
01:10:19.434 --> 01:10:21.519
All you do is kill, Kill, kill.

584
01:10:21.603 --> 01:10:24.022
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

585
01:10:24.105 --> 01:10:26.149
We want them to keep coming back.

586
01:10:26.232 --> 01:10:30.403
So don't just hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

587
01:10:32.989 --> 01:10:34.366
Spaniard.

588
01:10:42.165 --> 01:10:43.708
So entertain!

589
01:11:48.877 --> 01:11:53.006
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?

590
01:11:55.341 --> 01:11:57.552
Is this not why you're here?

591
01:12:02.182 --> 01:12:05.185
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

592
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:09.689
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

593
01:12:22.494 --> 01:12:24.204
What do you want?

594
01:12:26.748 --> 01:12:27.916
Girl?

595
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.168
Boy?

596
01:12:31.044 --> 01:12:33.338
- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.

597
01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.467
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

598
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:38.760
You could be magnificent.

599
01:12:38.843 --> 01:12:42.305
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.

600
01:12:43.139 --> 01:12:46.226
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

601
01:12:49.604 --> 01:12:53.525
The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles

602
01:12:53.608 --> 01:12:57.779
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

603
01:12:58.363 --> 01:13:00.281
I find that amusing,

604
01:13:00.615 --> 01:13:03.701
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

605
01:13:03.785 --> 01:13:07.247
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

606
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:14.379
So finally, after five years
of scratching a living

607
01:13:14.462 --> 01:13:16.673
in flea-infested villages,

608
01:13:16.756 --> 01:13:19.801
we're finally going back
to where we belong.

609
01:13:20.552 --> 01:13:22.095
The Colosseum.

610
01:13:24.389 --> 01:13:27.141
You should see the Colosseum,
Spaniard.

611
01:13:28.476 --> 01:13:30.562
Fifty thousand Romans,

612
01:13:31.479 --> 01:13:35.316
watching every movement of your sword,

613
01:13:36.776 --> 01:13:39.279
willing you to make that killer blow.

614
01:13:40.446 --> 01:13:44.075
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

615
01:13:45.076 --> 01:13:48.663
It rises. It rises up,

616
01:13:49.914 --> 01:13:51.499
like a storm.

617
01:13:52.292 --> 01:13:54.961
As if you were the thunder god himself.

618
01:13:55.044 --> 01:13:58.006
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

619
01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:06.639
You won your freedom?

620
01:14:06.723 --> 01:14:09.100
A long time ago, the Emperor

621
01:14:10.727 --> 01:14:12.854
presented me with a rudius.

622
01:14:12.937 --> 01:14:15.648
It's just a wooden sword.

623
01:14:17.317 --> 01:14:19.569
The symbol of your freedom.

624
01:14:21.779 --> 01:14:24.741
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

625
01:14:26.159 --> 01:14:28.578
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

626
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:32.874
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

627
01:14:33.499 --> 01:14:35.585
You asked me what I want.

628
01:14:36.961 --> 01:14:39.881
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor,

629
01:14:41.174 --> 01:14:42.592
as you did.

630
01:14:42.675 --> 01:14:46.054
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

631
01:14:46.971 --> 01:14:50.016
I wasn't the best because I killed quickly.

632
01:14:51.184 --> 01:14:53.853
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

633
01:14:54.979 --> 01:14:58.274
Win the crowd,
and you'! I win your freedom.

634
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:03.196
I will win the crowd.

635
01:15:06.866 --> 01:15:10.286
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

636
01:15:11.287 --> 01:15:14.332
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

637
01:15:14.999 --> 01:15:16.793
and have bloody adventures.

638
01:15:16.876 --> 01:15:18.670
And the great whore will suckle us

639
01:15:18.753 --> 01:15:21.339
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

640
01:15:21.422 --> 01:15:22.882
And then,

641
01:15:24.008 --> 01:15:26.177
when enough men have died,

642
01:15:28.304 --> 01:15:30.765
perhaps you will have your freedom.

643
01:15:35.228 --> 01:15:37.563
Here. Use this.

644
01:16:01.254 --> 01:16:04.424
It's somewhere out there, my country.

645
01:16:05.508 --> 01:16:06.843
My home.

646
01:16:08.011 --> 01:16:10.179
My wife is preparing food.

647
01:16:11.139 --> 01:16:13.850
My daughters carry water from the river.

648
01:16:15.226 --> 01:16:17.270
Will I ever see them again?

649
01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:20.023
I think, no.

650
01:16:20.314 --> 01:16:22.817
Do you believe you'I! see them again
when you die?

651
01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:24.277
I think SO.

652
01:16:24.861 --> 01:16:27.947
But then, I will die soon.

653
01:16:29.615 --> 01:16:32.076
They will not die for many years.

654
01:16:32.827 --> 01:16:34.537
MI have to wait.

655
01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:36.789
But you would? Wait?

656
01:16:37.415 --> 01:16:38.791
Of course.

657
01:16:40.668 --> 01:16:42.086
You see,

658
01:16:43.212 --> 01:16:46.799
My wife and my son

659
01:16:48.468 --> 01:16:50.678
are already waiting for me.

660
01:16:50.762 --> 01:16:54.432
You'! I meet them again. But not yet.

661
01:16:58.478 --> 01:16:59.812
Not yet.

662
01:17:01.397 --> 01:17:03.149
- Unless...
- Not yet.

663
01:17:07.153 --> 01:17:08.404
Not yet.

664
01:17:21.334 --> 01:17:22.835
There he is.

665
01:18:12.009 --> 01:18:13.094
Out.

666
01:18:14.303 --> 01:18:16.222
Move, go, out!

667
01:18:28.943 --> 01:18:31.445
Good to see you again, old friend.

668
01:18:36.784 --> 01:18:38.494
Bring me fortune.

669
01:18:43.082 --> 01:18:45.960
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

670
01:18:47.086 --> 01:18:49.630
I didn't know men
could build such things.

671
01:18:59.599 --> 01:19:01.184
Win the crowd.

672
01:19:01.434 --> 01:19:03.728
Get inside. Move.

673
01:19:03.811 --> 01:19:05.104
Inside.

674
01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:57.073
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

675
01:19:59.992 --> 01:20:02.119
Come, brother. It's Iate.

676
01:20:05.665 --> 01:20:08.501
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

677
01:20:11.337 --> 01:20:14.674
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

678
01:20:15.049 --> 01:20:18.261
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

679
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:28.062
Commodus, drink this tonic.

680
01:20:37.655 --> 01:20:40.074
I think the time is almost right.

681
01:20:40.449 --> 01:20:43.369
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

682
01:20:43.452 --> 01:20:45.538
at the celebration to honor our father.

683
01:20:45.663 --> 01:20:47.581
Do you think I should?

684
01:20:48.374 --> 01:20:50.251
Are the people ready?

685
01:20:52.378 --> 01:20:54.755
I think you need your rest now.

686
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.513
Will you stay with me?

687
01:21:02.596 --> 01:21:05.057
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

688
01:21:11.772 --> 01:21:13.024
Still.

689
01:21:14.859 --> 01:21:16.110
Always.

690
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.740
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

691
01:21:25.202 --> 01:21:26.746
Then kiss me.

692
01:21:35.546 --> 01:21:37.089
Sleep, brother.

693
01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:31.939
Having servants who are deaf and mute

694
01:22:32.023 --> 01:22:34.776
at least ensures I live a little longer.

695
01:22:36.569 --> 01:22:38.905
They're arresting scholars now.

696
01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:42.825
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

697
01:22:43.451 --> 01:22:45.369
And mathematicians.

698
01:22:46.579 --> 01:22:48.706
And all to feed the arena.

699
01:22:50.374 --> 01:22:52.794
<i>The Senate did not approve martial law.</i>

700
01:22:52.877 --> 01:22:55.713
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

701
01:22:56.881 --> 01:22:59.008
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

702
01:22:59.092 --> 01:23:02.637
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

703
01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:07.433
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

704
01:23:08.768 --> 01:23:13.189
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myself with.

705
01:23:13.981 --> 01:23:16.901
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,

706
01:23:16.984 --> 01:23:19.821
planning the festival
to honor your father.

707
01:23:19.904 --> 01:23:23.491
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

708
01:23:24.242 --> 01:23:26.452
So just what is he planning?

709
01:23:26.828 --> 01:23:28.454
And what pays for it?

710
01:23:28.538 --> 01:23:32.750
These daily games are costing
a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

711
01:23:33.501 --> 01:23:34.919
The future.

712
01:23:36.295 --> 01:23:38.339
The future pays for it.

713
01:23:39.799 --> 01:23:42.677
He's started selling the grain reserves.

714
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.595
This can't be true.

715
01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.723
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

716
01:23:48.307 --> 01:23:51.227
The people will be starving in two years.

717
01:23:51.769 --> 01:23:53.271
I hope they're enjoying the games,

718
01:23:53.354 --> 01:23:56.732
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

719
01:23:57.066 --> 01:23:59.402
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

720
01:23:59.902 --> 01:24:02.280
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

721
01:24:02.864 --> 01:24:06.450
And who will tell them
before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

722
01:24:07.785 --> 01:24:09.287
You, Gaius.

723
01:24:09.370 --> 01:24:11.080
Will you make a speech
on the floor of the Senate,

724
01:24:11.164 --> 01:24:12.915
denouncing my brother?

725
01:24:13.457 --> 01:24:16.002
And then see your family
in the Colosseum?

726
01:24:16.961 --> 01:24:18.337
Who'd dare?

727
01:24:27.513 --> 01:24:30.558
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day,

728
01:24:30.641 --> 01:24:33.227
because my son is heir to the throne.

729
01:24:38.816 --> 01:24:40.318
He must die.

730
01:24:44.655 --> 01:24:45.823
Quintus and the Praetorians

731
01:24:45.907 --> 01:24:48.451
would simply seize control
for themselves.

732
01:24:48.534 --> 01:24:52.413
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

733
01:24:52.496 --> 01:24:54.540
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

734
01:24:54.624 --> 01:24:58.753
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

735
01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:01.797
So we do nothing?

736
01:25:01.881 --> 01:25:04.675
No, child. We keep our counsel.

737
01:25:05.676 --> 01:25:07.011
We prepare.

738
01:25:07.845 --> 01:25:12.642
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

739
01:25:13.434 --> 01:25:14.852
We are air.

740
01:25:17.855 --> 01:25:20.650
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

741
01:25:20.733 --> 01:25:23.611
One day, he'! I have more enemies
than friends.

742
01:25:24.028 --> 01:25:26.989
And on that day, we will act.

743
01:25:27.573 --> 01:25:29.450
Then we will strike.

744
01:25:30.368 --> 01:25:32.119
But until then,

745
01:25:33.287 --> 01:25:34.872
we are docile.

746
01:25:35.331 --> 01:25:37.500
We are obedient.

747
01:25:39.085 --> 01:25:41.087
And we are treacherous.

748
01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.888
Come on!

749
01:25:59.730 --> 01:26:01.774
All right, that's enough.

750
01:26:24.338 --> 01:26:25.673
The Emperor wants battles,

751
01:26:25.756 --> 01:26:27.925
and I don't want to sacrifice
my best fighters.

752
01:26:28.009 --> 01:26:31.345
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

753
01:26:31.429 --> 01:26:35.016
- You get the battle of Carthage.
- Massacre of Carthage.

754
01:26:36.976 --> 01:26:38.394
Well, why don't you go down
to the prison,

755
01:26:38.477 --> 01:26:40.479
round up all the beggars and thieves?

756
01:26:40.563 --> 01:26:41.731
We've done that.

757
01:26:41.814 --> 01:26:44.191
If you want to give away
the best gladiators

758
01:26:44.275 --> 01:26:45.443
in the whole of the empire,

759
01:26:45.526 --> 01:26:47.653
then I want double the rates.

760
01:26:47.737 --> 01:26:51.532
You'! I get your contract rates,
or you'I! get your contract canceled.

761
01:26:51.615 --> 01:26:53.034
You don't like it?

762
01:26:53.117 --> 01:26:57.079
Then you can crawl back down
that shit hole that you came from.

763
01:27:00.166 --> 01:27:01.834
Cassius, please. You can free us.

764
01:27:32.242 --> 01:27:35.370
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

765
01:27:35.454 --> 01:27:36.538
Yes.

766
01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:39.583
They said you were a giant.

767
01:27:39.666 --> 01:27:42.794
They said you could crush
a man's skull with one hand.

768
01:27:42.878 --> 01:27:44.671
A man's? No.

769
01:27:46.006 --> 01:27:47.340
A boy's.

770
01:27:49.342 --> 01:27:52.846
- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

771
01:27:53.889 --> 01:27:57.017
This is Argento and this is Scarto.

772
01:27:58.393 --> 01:28:00.187
They were my horses.

773
01:28:01.146 --> 01:28:03.190
They were taken from me.

774
01:28:03.523 --> 01:28:06.818
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.

775
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.655
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

776
01:28:10.739 --> 01:28:14.034
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

777
01:28:15.827 --> 01:28:17.871
Master Lucius, it is time.

778
01:28:19.164 --> 01:28:20.499
I have to go.

779
01:28:20.582 --> 01:28:22.209
Your name is Lucius?

780
01:28:24.336 --> 01:28:27.005
Lucius Verus, after my father.

781
01:28:57.619 --> 01:28:59.371
Lower!

782
01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:07.420
- Claudius!
- Yes?

783
01:29:07.504 --> 01:29:09.923
- More shields!
- All right.

784
01:29:28.984 --> 01:29:33.738
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him,

785
01:29:33.822 --> 01:29:35.907
and then speak together.

786
01:29:36.658 --> 01:29:40.203
Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.

787
01:29:41.288 --> 01:29:44.124
Go, and die with honor.

788
01:30:39.179 --> 01:30:41.306
Hail, mighty Caesar!

789
01:30:44.309 --> 01:30:47.354
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

790
01:30:47.646 --> 01:30:51.024
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

791
01:30:51.775 --> 01:30:54.736
- We who are about to die salute you!
- We who are about to die salute you!

792
01:30:56.488 --> 01:30:58.031
On this day

793
01:30:58.782 --> 01:31:01.785
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

794
01:31:02.661 --> 01:31:06.289
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

795
01:31:06.373 --> 01:31:08.458
of mighty Carthage!

796
01:31:12.170 --> 01:31:16.549
On the barren plain of Zama

797
01:31:17.217 --> 01:31:20.261
there stood the invincible armies

798
01:31:20.679 --> 01:31:23.264
of the barbarian Hannibal.

799
01:31:24.015 --> 01:31:27.143
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

800
01:31:27.227 --> 01:31:29.646
from all brute nations,

801
01:31:29.729 --> 01:31:34.025
bent on merciless destruction,

802
01:31:34.901 --> 01:31:36.236
conquest.

803
01:31:37.195 --> 01:31:41.241
Your emperor is pleased to give you

804
01:31:41.324 --> 01:31:44.369
the barbarian horde!

805
01:31:52.711 --> 01:31:54.671
Anyone here been in the army?

806
01:31:54.754 --> 01:31:57.716
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

807
01:31:58.675 --> 01:32:00.301
You can help me.

808
01:32:01.594 --> 01:32:04.139
Whatever comes out of these gates,

809
01:32:04.931 --> 01:32:08.685
we've got a better chance
of survival if we work together.

810
01:32:08.768 --> 01:32:10.520
Do you understand?

811
01:32:12.605 --> 01:32:14.691
If we stay together, we survive.

812
01:32:14.774 --> 01:32:17.861
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

813
01:32:17.944 --> 01:32:21.573
of Scipio Africanus!

814
01:32:32.333 --> 01:32:34.085
To the death!

815
01:32:37.881 --> 01:32:40.467
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

816
01:32:44.304 --> 01:32:45.889
Stay close.

817
01:32:51.853 --> 01:32:53.772
Come together!

818
01:32:55.064 --> 01:32:59.152
Stay close. Staggered columns!

819
01:33:12.332 --> 01:33:14.417
You don't have a chance.

820
01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:28.306
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

821
01:33:29.808 --> 01:33:31.351
Hold!

822
01:33:33.436 --> 01:33:36.439
Hold! As one!

823
01:33:39.359 --> 01:33:40.693
Well done.

824
01:33:52.539 --> 01:33:56.376
Hold. Down Iow!

825
01:34:02.215 --> 01:34:03.383
Yes!

826
01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:16.729
Hagen!

827
01:34:40.879 --> 01:34:44.424
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

828
01:34:48.052 --> 01:34:49.429
Quickly!

829
01:34:50.096 --> 01:34:52.807
- Get out there.
- Hurry!

830
01:35:34.057 --> 01:35:35.224
Maximus!

831
01:35:47.445 --> 01:35:49.822
Single column! Single column!

832
01:36:35.159 --> 01:36:36.536
We win!

833
01:36:41.916 --> 01:36:44.460
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

834
01:36:45.253 --> 01:36:48.214
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Carthage?

835
01:36:48.297 --> 01:36:50.049
Yes, sire.

836
01:36:51.968 --> 01:36:53.302
Forgive me, sire.

837
01:36:53.386 --> 01:36:56.097
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

838
01:36:56.889 --> 01:36:58.057
Who is he?

839
01:36:58.141 --> 01:37:01.102
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

840
01:37:03.604 --> 01:37:05.565
I think II meet him.

841
01:37:05.648 --> 01:37:06.983
Yes, sire.

842
01:37:09.193 --> 01:37:11.070
Hail to the barbarians!

843
01:37:26.044 --> 01:37:29.422
Forward! Arms at ready!

844
01:37:42.977 --> 01:37:44.645
Drop your weapons.

845
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:51.611
Gladiator, the Emperor
has asked for you.

846
01:37:52.236 --> 01:37:54.447
I am at the Emperor's service.

847
01:38:21.140 --> 01:38:23.309
Rise. Rise.

848
01:38:32.652 --> 01:38:34.904
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

849
01:38:34.987 --> 01:38:37.448
I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.

850
01:38:37.532 --> 01:38:40.493
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

851
01:38:40.576 --> 01:38:42.161
Or was it Hercules?

852
01:38:43.538 --> 01:38:47.375
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

853
01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:51.045
You do have a name.

854
01:38:51.838 --> 01:38:53.714
My name is Gladiator.

855
01:38:57.009 --> 01:39:00.179
How dare you show your back
to me? Slave!

856
01:39:01.556 --> 01:39:04.892
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

857
01:39:16.696 --> 01:39:19.198
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

858
01:39:19.532 --> 01:39:21.492
commander of the armies of the north,

859
01:39:21.576 --> 01:39:23.953
general of the Felix Legions,

860
01:39:24.036 --> 01:39:27.331
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

861
01:39:28.708 --> 01:39:30.877
father to a murdered son,

862
01:39:31.377 --> 01:39:33.671
husband to a murdered wife,

863
01:39:34.005 --> 01:39:37.717
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

864
01:39:44.724 --> 01:39:46.100
Arms!

865
01:39:59.238 --> 01:40:02.533
Live! Live! Live! Live!

866
01:40:02.617 --> 01:40:05.870
- Live! Live! Live! Live!
- Live! Live! Live! Live!

867
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:52.583
Arms, at rest!

868
01:41:45.052 --> 01:41:49.515
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

869
01:42:37.589 --> 01:42:38.757
Father.

870
01:43:53.123 --> 01:43:55.000
Why is he still alive?

871
01:43:56.251 --> 01:43:57.753
I don't know.

872
01:43:58.253 --> 01:43:59.838
He shouldn't be alive.

873
01:44:00.672 --> 01:44:02.090
It vexes me.

874
01:44:03.842 --> 01:44:05.636
I'm terribly vexed.

875
01:44:16.855 --> 01:44:18.774
I did what I had to do.

876
01:44:19.524 --> 01:44:23.570
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

877
01:44:23.654 --> 01:44:25.322
You do see that.

878
01:44:25.697 --> 01:44:26.865
Yes.

879
01:44:31.662 --> 01:44:34.873
What did you feel when you saw him?

880
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.627
I felt nothing.

881
01:44:40.587 --> 01:44:43.131
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

882
01:44:44.174 --> 01:44:46.385
No more than I wounded him.

883
01:44:50.889 --> 01:44:53.183
They lied to me in Germania.

884
01:44:54.810 --> 01:44:56.895
They told me he was dead.

885
01:44:58.897 --> 01:45:01.483
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

886
01:45:01.566 --> 01:45:04.903
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

887
01:45:06.238 --> 01:45:08.615
Then you must let the legions know

888
01:45:08.699 --> 01:45:11.785
their treachery will not go unpunished.

889
01:45:12.619 --> 01:45:14.079
Poor sister.

890
01:45:14.496 --> 01:45:16.957
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

891
01:45:18.166 --> 01:45:19.918
What will you do?

892
01:45:32.889 --> 01:45:34.224
This way.

893
01:46:09.593 --> 01:46:13.055
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

894
01:46:13.138 --> 01:46:15.640
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

895
01:46:16.141 --> 01:46:17.768
I didn't realize he would send his best.

896
01:46:20.395 --> 01:46:22.481
Maximus, he doesn't know.

897
01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:26.568
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

898
01:46:26.651 --> 01:46:29.196
- I knew nothing..
- Don't lie to me!

899
01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:37.412
I wept for them.

900
01:46:37.496 --> 01:46:41.333
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?

901
01:46:41.416 --> 01:46:45.003
I have been living
in a prison of fear since that day.

902
01:46:45.504 --> 01:46:49.341
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

903
01:46:50.217 --> 01:46:53.428
To live in terror
every moment of every day,

904
01:46:53.512 --> 01:46:56.306
because your son is heir to the throne.

905
01:46:58.183 --> 01:46:59.643
I have wept.

906
01:47:00.977 --> 01:47:03.814
My son was innocent.

907
01:47:04.648 --> 01:47:06.691
So is mine.

908
01:47:08.693 --> 01:47:11.780
Must my son die, too,
before you'! I trust me?

909
01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:16.201
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

910
01:47:17.077 --> 01:47:20.122
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

911
01:47:20.205 --> 01:47:23.667
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.

912
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:25.544
The gods have spared me?

913
01:47:25.627 --> 01:47:29.089
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

914
01:47:29.172 --> 01:47:30.715
That is power.

915
01:47:31.216 --> 01:47:32.342
The mob is Rome.

916
01:47:32.425 --> 01:47:36.054
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

917
01:47:36.388 --> 01:47:37.931
Listen to me.

918
01:47:38.473 --> 01:47:41.601
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

919
01:47:41.685 --> 01:47:43.937
But while the people follow him,

920
01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:47.065
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

921
01:47:48.024 --> 01:47:50.318
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

922
01:47:50.402 --> 01:47:54.156
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

923
01:47:54.239 --> 01:47:55.991
One man above all.

924
01:47:57.075 --> 01:48:00.162
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

925
01:48:00.495 --> 01:48:02.414
Do you not understand?

926
01:48:02.664 --> 01:48:06.877
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

927
01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:09.629
What possible difference can I make?

928
01:48:09.921 --> 01:48:12.174
This man wants what you want.

929
01:48:12.257 --> 01:48:14.467
Then have him kill Commodus!

930
01:48:17.095 --> 01:48:18.889
I knew a man once,

931
01:48:19.806 --> 01:48:21.099
a noble man.

932
01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:24.978
A man of principle who loved my father,

933
01:48:25.937 --> 01:48:28.023
and my father loved him.

934
01:48:29.983 --> 01:48:32.152
This man served Rome well.

935
01:48:36.489 --> 01:48:38.200
That man is gone.

936
01:48:39.367 --> 01:48:41.494
Your brother did his work well.

937
01:48:41.578 --> 01:48:43.246
Let me help you.

938
01:48:49.169 --> 01:48:52.255
Yes, you can help me.

939
01:48:55.592 --> 01:48:59.304
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

940
01:49:02.974 --> 01:49:05.727
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

941
01:49:34.172 --> 01:49:35.840
What's your name?

942
01:49:38.843 --> 01:49:40.428
Julian Crassus.

943
01:49:45.934 --> 01:49:47.185
Name?

944
01:49:48.478 --> 01:49:49.980
Marcus, sire.

945
01:49:50.897 --> 01:49:52.607
My father's name.

946
01:50:00.115 --> 01:50:02.284
They must have known
of Maximus' escape,

947
01:50:02.367 --> 01:50:05.203
when they found
the bodies of the four men.

948
01:50:05.662 --> 01:50:08.248
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

949
01:50:09.291 --> 01:50:12.460
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

950
01:50:19.801 --> 01:50:21.511
Load your arrows!

951
01:50:29.144 --> 01:50:31.062
Prepare to fire!

952
01:50:51.583 --> 01:50:54.878
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

953
01:50:55.712 --> 01:50:57.422
and never told me.

954
01:50:57.672 --> 01:50:59.924
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

955
01:51:01.426 --> 01:51:04.262
But a general is always in control.

956
01:51:05.638 --> 01:51:09.309
Always in command, isn't he?

957
01:51:10.852 --> 01:51:12.312
Yes, Caesar.

958
01:51:26.242 --> 01:51:28.953
Then give the command. Say it.

959
01:51:45.845 --> 01:51:46.971
Fire.

960
01:52:22.215 --> 01:52:23.550
Maximus.

961
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:27.429
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

962
01:52:28.304 --> 01:52:30.515
- Yes.
- In Germania?

963
01:52:32.434 --> 01:52:34.185
In many countries.

964
01:52:35.770 --> 01:52:37.105
General.

965
01:53:26.053 --> 01:53:27.930
You have a great name.

966
01:53:29.473 --> 01:53:32.517
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

967
01:53:41.485 --> 01:53:42.819
Yes, at the far end.

968
01:53:42.903 --> 01:53:44.821
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

969
01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:47.240
Senator Gracchus.

970
01:53:48.867 --> 01:53:52.287
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

971
01:53:52.371 --> 01:53:55.499
I don't pretend to be
a man of the people, Senator,

972
01:53:55.582 --> 01:53:58.085
but I do try to be a man for the people.

973
01:54:14.309 --> 01:54:16.853
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

974
01:54:16.937 --> 01:54:19.606
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

975
01:54:24.111 --> 01:54:25.737
People of Rome!

976
01:54:28.031 --> 01:54:30.450
On the fourth day of Antioch,

977
01:54:31.118 --> 01:54:35.455
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

978
01:54:36.123 --> 01:54:40.335
And in his majestic charity,

979
01:54:41.128 --> 01:54:45.298
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

980
01:54:45.924 --> 01:54:49.302
with an historical final match.

981
01:54:50.137 --> 01:54:54.683
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,

982
01:54:56.143 --> 01:54:59.563
Caesar is pleased to bring you

983
01:54:59.646 --> 01:55:03.442
the only undefeated champion

984
01:55:03.525 --> 01:55:05.527
in Roman history,

985
01:55:05.610 --> 01:55:10.490
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

986
01:55:32.095 --> 01:55:35.265
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

987
01:55:35.348 --> 01:55:38.060
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

988
01:55:38.143 --> 01:55:40.937
This is not it. This is not it!

989
01:55:41.021 --> 01:55:43.857
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

990
01:55:44.691 --> 01:55:47.277
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

991
01:55:47.944 --> 01:55:50.030
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

992
01:55:50.155 --> 01:55:54.034
Representing the training
lyceum of Antonius Proximo,

993
01:55:54.117 --> 01:55:57.788
Caesar is proud to give you

994
01:55:57.871 --> 01:56:01.708
Aelius Maximus!

995
01:56:14.513 --> 01:56:16.848
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

996
01:56:16.932 --> 01:56:20.894
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

997
01:56:23.605 --> 01:56:26.441
No, much sooner than that.

998
01:56:28.401 --> 01:56:30.195
It's been arranged.

999
01:56:48.713 --> 01:56:51.675
We who are about to die salute you.

1000
01:56:54.970 --> 01:56:56.763
We're with you, Maximus!

1001
01:57:39.389 --> 01:57:41.141
Fight on, finish it!

1002
01:58:09.419 --> 01:58:11.087
Pull, pull!

1003
01:58:43.453 --> 01:58:44.996
Loose! Loose!

1004
01:59:13.066 --> 01:59:15.193
- Gut him!
- Kill!

1005
01:59:16.611 --> 01:59:20.240
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

1006
01:59:40.677 --> 01:59:42.721
- Kill!
- Kill!

1007
02:00:20.592 --> 02:00:22.802
Maximus the Merciful!

1008
02:00:31.978 --> 02:00:35.440
Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

1009
02:00:35.523 --> 02:00:38.443
Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1010
02:00:43.656 --> 02:00:47.035
Forward, arms at ready!

1011
02:01:17.524 --> 02:01:19.901
What am I going to do with you?

1012
02:01:21.069 --> 02:01:24.531
You simply won't die.

1013
02:01:29.327 --> 02:01:31.704
Are we so different, you and I?

1014
02:01:32.831 --> 02:01:35.708
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1015
02:01:37.127 --> 02:01:40.797
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

1016
02:01:41.339 --> 02:01:43.049
Then take it now.

1017
02:01:56.104 --> 02:01:58.106
They tell me your son

1018
02:01:58.898 --> 02:02:02.861
squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.

1019
02:02:04.988 --> 02:02:06.656
And your wife

1020
02:02:07.907 --> 02:02:09.784
moaned like a whore

1021
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:15.498
when they ravaged her again and again

1022
02:02:16.833 --> 02:02:18.251
and again.

1023
02:02:23.465 --> 02:02:27.260
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,

1024
02:02:31.848 --> 02:02:33.224
Highness.

1025
02:02:47.447 --> 02:02:50.450
Maximus!
Maximus! Maximus!

1026
02:03:00.752 --> 02:03:03.630
General! General!

1027
02:03:05.131 --> 02:03:07.675
General! General! General!

1028
02:03:08.593 --> 02:03:10.386
- General!
- Cicero!

1029
02:03:17.810 --> 02:03:19.354
- General!
- Where are you camped?

1030
02:03:19.437 --> 02:03:20.688
Ostia.

1031
02:03:27.153 --> 02:03:30.114
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!

1032
02:03:30.198 --> 02:03:32.742
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

1033
02:03:32.867 --> 02:03:34.661
- Move along!
- Find me!

1034
02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:02.522
Can they hear you?

1035
02:04:06.067 --> 02:04:09.612
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

1036
02:04:12.073 --> 02:04:14.450
- Yes.
- What do you say to them?

1037
02:04:18.329 --> 02:04:19.789
To my boy,

1038
02:04:21.583 --> 02:04:24.127
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1039
02:04:24.210 --> 02:04:26.379
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1040
02:04:29.090 --> 02:04:30.633
To my wife,

1041
02:04:33.136 --> 02:04:35.221
that is not your business.

1042
02:04:42.895 --> 02:04:45.773
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

1043
02:04:47.191 --> 02:04:50.737
So I can't just kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1044
02:04:52.071 --> 02:04:56.284
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1045
02:04:57.577 --> 02:04:59.370
He is defying you.

1046
02:04:59.454 --> 02:05:02.832
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1047
02:05:02.915 --> 02:05:06.544
The mob sees this,
and so do the Senate.

1048
02:05:07.295 --> 02:05:10.214
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1049
02:05:11.758 --> 02:05:12.800
- Kill him.
- No.

1050
02:05:15.524 --> 02:05:17.984
I will not make a martyr of him.

1051
02:05:25.117 --> 02:05:27.577
When I went to the Senate today,

1052
02:05:27.661 --> 02:05:32.124
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1053
02:05:34.042 --> 02:05:36.211
And did you note what happened?

1054
02:05:36.294 --> 02:05:39.506
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

1055
02:05:40.507 --> 02:05:42.843
Not a single word of protest.

1056
02:05:42.926 --> 02:05:46.555
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1057
02:05:46.638 --> 02:05:47.806
Why?

1058
02:05:49.516 --> 02:05:53.228
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1059
02:05:53.311 --> 02:05:57.357
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1060
02:05:57.816 --> 02:06:01.528
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as if wounded.

1061
02:06:02.451 --> 02:06:04.662
Then its enemies will approach,

1062
02:06:04.745 --> 02:06:07.832
and yet it will lie quite still.

1063
02:06:08.165 --> 02:06:11.961
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

1064
02:06:12.044 --> 02:06:15.339
and yet it remains still.

1065
02:06:18.551 --> 02:06:19.719
So,

1066
02:06:21.012 --> 02:06:22.847
we will lie still,

1067
02:06:23.556 --> 02:06:26.893
and let our enemies come to us
and nibble.

1068
02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:30.313
Have every senator followed.

1069
02:06:47.955 --> 02:06:49.707
Cicero, my old friend.

1070
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:51.667
I thought perhaps I'd seen you
for the last time.

1071
02:06:51.751 --> 02:06:54.295
- Thought you were dead.
- Close.

1072
02:06:54.378 --> 02:06:56.005
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1073
02:06:56.088 --> 02:06:57.381
All winter.

1074
02:06:57.757 --> 02:07:01.052
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

1075
02:07:01.719 --> 02:07:04.805
- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.

1076
02:07:06.432 --> 02:07:08.267
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1077
02:07:08.351 --> 02:07:10.144
For you, tomorrow.

1078
02:07:11.604 --> 02:07:14.106
I need you to do something for me.

1079
02:07:18.736 --> 02:07:20.154
Come, see, witness.

1080
02:07:20.237 --> 02:07:23.282
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1081
02:07:23.366 --> 02:07:26.994
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1082
02:07:27.078 --> 02:07:29.664
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone,

1083
02:07:29.747 --> 02:07:31.415
by doing this to him, they do...

1084
02:07:32.708 --> 02:07:34.001
My goodness!

1085
02:07:35.836 --> 02:07:39.423
- He got him, he's defeated.
- Give way!

1086
02:07:45.513 --> 02:07:48.099
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

1087
02:07:48.182 --> 02:07:49.725
- Back.
- My lady.

1088
02:07:49.809 --> 02:07:52.228
I served your father at Vindobona.

1089
02:07:52.311 --> 02:07:53.354
Back!

1090
02:07:53.437 --> 02:07:56.691
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1091
02:07:58.192 --> 02:07:59.777
Stop. Stop.

1092
02:08:00.319 --> 02:08:01.612
Stop!

1093
02:08:02.405 --> 02:08:03.781
Stand back.

1094
02:08:05.116 --> 02:08:08.160
The general sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1095
02:08:09.870 --> 02:08:13.124
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1096
02:08:22.925 --> 02:08:24.260
Leave us.

1097
02:08:29.974 --> 02:08:31.684
Senator Gracchus.

1098
02:08:45.489 --> 02:08:46.782
General.

1099
02:08:47.825 --> 02:08:50.578
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough

1100
02:08:50.661 --> 02:08:53.789
that you can trust me.

1101
02:08:58.085 --> 02:09:00.588
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

1102
02:09:02.089 --> 02:09:04.800
Yes. I can speak for them.

1103
02:09:05.384 --> 02:09:08.763
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1104
02:09:09.138 --> 02:09:10.556
To what end?

1105
02:09:12.016 --> 02:09:14.351
Get me outside the city walls.

1106
02:09:14.977 --> 02:09:18.856
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1107
02:09:18.939 --> 02:09:22.276
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1108
02:09:22.359 --> 02:09:24.612
But the legions
all have new commanders,

1109
02:09:24.695 --> 02:09:26.113
loyal to Commodus.

1110
02:09:26.197 --> 02:09:29.366
Let my men see me alive, and
you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1111
02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:31.118
This is madness.

1112
02:09:31.786 --> 02:09:35.122
No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.

1113
02:09:35.206 --> 02:09:37.458
I will not trade one dictatorship
for another!

1114
02:09:37.541 --> 02:09:41.045
The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1115
02:09:41.587 --> 02:09:44.715
And after your glorious coup, what then?

1116
02:09:45.883 --> 02:09:49.553
You'll take your 5,000 warriors
and leave?

1117
02:09:49.637 --> 02:09:51.180
I will leave.

1118
02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:53.682
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,

1119
02:09:53.766 --> 02:09:55.476
under the command of the Senate.

1120
02:09:55.559 --> 02:09:56.727
So,

1121
02:09:57.061 --> 02:10:01.315
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1122
02:10:02.817 --> 02:10:03.901
Tell me why.

1123
02:10:09.955 --> 02:10:13.124
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1124
02:10:16.169 --> 02:10:18.046
I Will kill Commodus.

1125
02:10:19.965 --> 02:10:23.051
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1126
02:10:24.803 --> 02:10:27.097
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1127
02:10:28.932 --> 02:10:30.976
His daughter trusts you.

1128
02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:36.648
I Will trust you.

1129
02:10:37.065 --> 02:10:39.109
But we have little time.

1130
02:10:39.651 --> 02:10:41.403
Give me two days,

1131
02:10:42.195 --> 02:10:44.447
and I will buy your freedom.

1132
02:10:45.073 --> 02:10:46.408
And you,

1133
02:10:47.951 --> 02:10:49.536
you stay alive,

1134
02:10:51.037 --> 02:10:52.706
or II be dead.

1135
02:10:54.666 --> 02:10:56.251
Now we must go.

1136
02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:26.906
He'!! be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1137
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:28.575
He'll find you.

1138
02:12:12.744 --> 02:12:14.204
It won't work.

1139
02:12:15.163 --> 02:12:17.290
The Emperor knows too much.

1140
02:12:18.041 --> 02:12:19.042
And as for me,

1141
02:12:21.378 --> 02:12:23.421
its becoming dangerous.

1142
02:12:24.714 --> 02:12:26.966
You'! I be paid on my return.

1143
02:12:29.052 --> 02:12:30.845
I give you my word.

1144
02:12:31.096 --> 02:12:34.182
Your word? What if you don't return?

1145
02:12:35.433 --> 02:12:38.395
<i>DO you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?</i>

1146
02:12:38.478 --> 02:12:39.729
Trust?

1147
02:12:43.983 --> 02:12:45.735
Who am I to trust?

1148
02:12:46.319 --> 02:12:49.489
- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?

1149
02:12:50.281 --> 02:12:51.991
He makes me rich.

1150
02:12:57.122 --> 02:12:59.958
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1151
02:13:01.710 --> 02:13:04.295
I know that you would die for honor.

1152
02:13:05.630 --> 02:13:07.590
You would die for Rome.

1153
02:13:08.633 --> 02:13:11.761
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1154
02:13:11.845 --> 02:13:14.139
But I, on the other hand,

1155
02:13:16.850 --> 02:13:18.685
I'm an entertainer.

1156
02:13:22.188 --> 02:13:23.398
Guard!

1157
02:13:28.236 --> 02:13:30.822
He killed the man who set you free.

1158
02:13:39.998 --> 02:13:41.833
Praetorians, master.

1159
02:13:48.006 --> 02:13:49.174
Halt!

1160
02:14:54.322 --> 02:14:56.115
Where have you been?

1161
02:14:56.574 --> 02:14:58.159
I sent for you.

1162
02:14:59.744 --> 02:15:01.412
Please, brother.

1163
02:15:07.168 --> 02:15:09.045
What's troubling you?

1164
02:15:11.464 --> 02:15:13.842
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1165
02:15:15.635 --> 02:15:17.136
I don't know.

1166
02:15:19.138 --> 02:15:21.266
I thought you'd seen him.

1167
02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:24.602
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1168
02:15:26.437 --> 02:15:29.649
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1169
02:15:30.066 --> 02:15:32.110
And he will bleed, too.

1170
02:15:32.986 --> 02:15:34.362
Very soon.

1171
02:15:35.864 --> 02:15:37.532
But not tonight.

1172
02:15:52.423 --> 02:15:55.342
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1173
02:15:56.677 --> 02:15:58.345
"Its a dream,

1174
02:16:00.222 --> 02:16:02.099
"a frightful dream,

1175
02:16:04.685 --> 02:16:06.020
"life is."

1176
02:16:08.731 --> 02:16:10.775
Do you think that's true?

1177
02:16:11.567 --> 02:16:13.069
I don't know.

1178
02:16:16.614 --> 02:16:18.157
I think it is.

1179
02:16:20.951 --> 02:16:23.662
And I have only you to share it with.

1180
02:17:01.283 --> 02:17:02.868
Open your mouth.

1181
02:17:40.197 --> 02:17:41.991
You know I love you.

1182
02:17:44.034 --> 02:17:45.661
And I love you.

1183
02:18:22.323 --> 02:18:23.866
Out. Get out!

1184
02:18:25.075 --> 02:18:26.285
Move!

1185
02:18:30.998 --> 02:18:33.000
Congratulations, General.

1186
02:18:33.083 --> 02:18:35.920
You've got very persuasive friends.

1187
02:18:41.926 --> 02:18:44.386
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1188
02:18:44.470 --> 02:18:47.973
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1189
02:18:48.057 --> 02:18:51.644
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1190
02:18:52.353 --> 02:18:55.981
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1191
02:18:58.025 --> 02:19:00.277
- You have done all this?
- Yes.

1192
02:19:01.528 --> 02:19:03.239
You risk too much.

1193
02:19:04.156 --> 02:19:06.158
I have much to pay for.

1194
02:19:08.619 --> 02:19:10.829
You have nothing to pay for.

1195
02:19:10.913 --> 02:19:13.958
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1196
02:19:17.169 --> 02:19:19.546
I am tired of being strong.

1197
02:19:21.465 --> 02:19:25.678
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1198
02:19:26.178 --> 02:19:29.306
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1199
02:19:30.641 --> 02:19:32.893
Because my father loved you.

1200
02:19:36.814 --> 02:19:38.482
And because I loved you.

1201
02:19:41.819 --> 02:19:43.487
A long time ago.

1202
02:19:48.242 --> 02:19:50.327
Was I very different then?

1203
02:19:56.917 --> 02:19:58.669
You laughed more.

1204
02:20:02.715 --> 02:20:05.175
I have felt alone all my life,

1205
02:20:06.468 --> 02:20:08.137
except with you.

1206
02:20:11.181 --> 02:20:12.558
I must go.

1207
02:20:13.267 --> 02:20:14.351
Yes.

1208
02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:44.048
There.

1209
02:20:55.642 --> 02:20:57.144
And I got you.

1210
02:21:00.189 --> 02:21:02.107
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1211
02:21:02.191 --> 02:21:04.234
I'm not a legionnaire.

1212
02:21:04.568 --> 02:21:07.196
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1213
02:21:08.447 --> 02:21:09.907
A gladiator?

1214
02:21:10.657 --> 02:21:13.327
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1215
02:21:13.410 --> 02:21:16.830
Wouldn't you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1216
02:21:16.914 --> 02:21:19.458
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1217
02:21:22.336 --> 02:21:24.171
<i>The savior of Rome?</i>

1218
02:21:32.137 --> 02:21:33.889
And who said that?

1219
02:21:42.731 --> 02:21:44.274
Where's Lucius?

1220
02:21:45.526 --> 02:21:47.945
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1221
02:21:50.864 --> 02:21:52.533
- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1222
02:21:52.616 --> 02:21:54.827
She took it from a basket,

1223
02:21:56.286 --> 02:22:00.040
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1224
02:22:01.625 --> 02:22:04.878
- It bit her in the breast?
- Yes.

1225
02:22:05.546 --> 02:22:09.466
You see, Lucius, sometimes royal ladies

1226
02:22:09.967 --> 02:22:13.971
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1227
02:22:14.054 --> 02:22:16.640
I think it's silly.
- So do I.

1228
02:22:18.725 --> 02:22:20.018
So do I.

1229
02:22:20.602 --> 02:22:22.646
Sister, join us.

1230
02:22:23.313 --> 02:22:25.065
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1231
02:22:25.149 --> 02:22:27.151
- I've been reading, too.
- Yes.

1232
02:22:27.234 --> 02:22:31.530
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1233
02:22:33.115 --> 02:22:35.534
We've been reading about
the great Mark Antony,

1234
02:22:35.617 --> 02:22:36.910
and his adventures in Egypt.

1235
02:22:36.994 --> 02:22:39.580
And the queen killed herself
with a snake.

1236
02:22:39.663 --> 02:22:43.000
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1237
02:22:43.083 --> 02:22:44.918
If you're very good,

1238
02:22:45.002 --> 02:22:48.755
tomorrow night, II tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1239
02:22:48.839 --> 02:22:50.591
He was betrayed

1240
02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:53.886
by those closest to him.

1241
02:22:55.804 --> 02:22:57.514
By his own blood.

1242
02:22:58.849 --> 02:23:01.351
They whispered in dark corners

1243
02:23:01.435 --> 02:23:03.896
and went out late at night,

1244
02:23:03.979 --> 02:23:07.316
and conspired, and conspired.

1245
02:23:09.902 --> 02:23:13.780
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1246
02:23:13.864 --> 02:23:16.450
He knew they were busy little bees.

1247
02:23:18.368 --> 02:23:21.455
And one night he sat down
with one of them,

1248
02:23:22.206 --> 02:23:24.208
and he looked at her,

1249
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.543
and he said,

1250
02:23:27.711 --> 02:23:30.255
“Tell me what you've been doing,

1251
02:23:30.923 --> 02:23:32.674
"busy little bee.

1252
02:23:34.927 --> 02:23:38.055
"Or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1253
02:23:39.223 --> 02:23:42.226
"You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood."

1254
02:23:46.123 --> 02:23:48.542
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1255
02:23:50.627 --> 02:23:52.838
The little bee
had wounded him more deeply

1256
02:23:52.921 --> 02:23:55.632
than anyone else could ever have done.

1257
02:23:57.759 --> 02:24:00.637
What do you think happened then,
Lucius?

1258
02:24:01.263 --> 02:24:03.098
I don't know, Uncle.

1259
02:24:09.605 --> 02:24:12.191
The little bee told him everything.

1260
02:25:10.082 --> 02:25:13.085
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1261
02:25:13.919 --> 02:25:15.212
Proximo!

1262
02:25:16.088 --> 02:25:19.216
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1263
02:25:20.050 --> 02:25:21.385
Proximo!

1264
02:25:23.595 --> 02:25:25.055
Open the gates!

1265
02:25:30.894 --> 02:25:33.188
Open the gates, Proximo.

1266
02:25:33.647 --> 02:25:35.899
Do you want to die, old man?

1267
02:25:36.945 --> 02:25:38.071
Here.

1268
02:25:38.655 --> 02:25:40.823
Everything is prepared.

1269
02:25:40.907 --> 02:25:43.368
It seems you have won your freedom.

1270
02:25:43.451 --> 02:25:47.038
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1271
02:25:52.126 --> 02:25:55.964
- Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1272
02:25:56.506 --> 02:25:58.675
Open the gates!

1273
02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:06.140
Pull!

1274
02:26:08.268 --> 02:26:11.145
Move! Form a column on the left!

1275
02:26:14.941 --> 02:26:18.152
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1276
02:26:18.236 --> 02:26:20.697
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1277
02:26:20.780 --> 02:26:23.032
We'! I wait here for you, Maximus.

1278
02:26:23.116 --> 02:26:24.909
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

1279
02:26:24.993 --> 02:26:26.035
Go.

1280
02:26:26.911 --> 02:26:28.746
Strength and honor.

1281
02:26:31.374 --> 02:26:34.210
Aim. Arch your bows!

1282
02:27:41.319 --> 02:27:42.612
Shadows and dust.

1283
02:28:24.529 --> 02:28:25.780
Maximus!

1284
02:28:31.244 --> 02:28:32.662
I'm sorry.

1285
02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:00.440
It's done.

1286
02:29:07.405 --> 02:29:09.282
And what of my nephew?

1287
02:29:10.366 --> 02:29:12.368
And what of his mother?

1288
02:29:14.454 --> 02:29:16.998
Should they share her lover's fate?

1289
02:29:18.708 --> 02:29:20.751
Or should I be merciful?

1290
02:29:23.463 --> 02:29:25.381
Commodus the Merciful.

1291
02:29:31.804 --> 02:29:34.140
Lucius will stay with me now.

1292
02:29:35.308 --> 02:29:37.101
And if his mother

1293
02:29:38.478 --> 02:29:40.605
so much as looks at me

1294
02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:44.275
in a manner that displeases me,

1295
02:29:46.235 --> 02:29:47.653
he will die.

1296
02:29:51.157 --> 02:29:54.410
If she decides to be noble,

1297
02:29:56.162 --> 02:29:58.247
and takes her own life,

1298
02:29:59.832 --> 02:30:01.292
he will die.

1299
02:30:04.921 --> 02:30:06.631
And as for you,

1300
02:30:09.425 --> 02:30:11.177
you will love me,

1301
02:30:12.011 --> 02:30:13.804
as I have loved you.

1302
02:30:15.389 --> 02:30:19.060
You Will provide me with an heir
of pure blood,

1303
02:30:20.019 --> 02:30:21.854
so that Commodus

1304
02:30:22.438 --> 02:30:25.399
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1305
02:30:30.029 --> 02:30:31.781
Am I not merciful?

1306
02:30:53.636 --> 02:30:56.264
Am I not merciful!

1307
02:31:08.484 --> 02:31:12.488
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1308
02:31:40.101 --> 02:31:42.854
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1309
02:31:45.607 --> 02:31:49.861
Nothing happens to anyone that
he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1310
02:32:22.811 --> 02:32:24.104
Maximus.

1311
02:32:25.146 --> 02:32:26.481
Maximus.

1312
02:32:27.482 --> 02:32:28.775
Maximus.

1313
02:32:30.485 --> 02:32:32.320
They call for you.

1314
02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:37.534
The general who became a slave.

1315
02:32:38.785 --> 02:32:41.162
The slave who became a gladiator.

1316
02:32:42.539 --> 02:32:45.333
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1317
02:32:47.335 --> 02:32:49.004
A striking story.

1318
02:32:50.171 --> 02:32:53.383
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1319
02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:58.013
Only a famous death will do.

1320
02:32:59.931 --> 02:33:02.475
And what could be more glorious

1321
02:33:02.851 --> 02:33:06.604
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1322
02:33:08.940 --> 02:33:11.985
- You would fight me?
- Why not?

1323
02:33:13.069 --> 02:33:15.113
Do you think I'm afraid?

1324
02:33:16.031 --> 02:33:19.075
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1325
02:33:19.159 --> 02:33:22.871
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1326
02:33:28.626 --> 02:33:32.005
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1327
02:33:32.881 --> 02:33:35.383
"All a man can do is smile back."

1328
02:33:37.177 --> 02:33:38.595
I wonder,

1329
02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:42.015
did your friend smile at his own death?

1330
02:33:42.390 --> 02:33:43.892
You must know.

1331
02:33:46.811 --> 02:33:48.605
He was your father.

1332
02:33:52.484 --> 02:33:54.819
You loved my father, I know,

1333
02:33:56.321 --> 02:33:57.822
but so did I.

1334
02:33:59.449 --> 02:34:02.035
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1335
02:34:04.662 --> 02:34:06.247
Smile for me now, brother.

1336
02:34:12.095 --> 02:34:14.931
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.

1337
02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:11.320
Ring formation!

1338
02:37:03.099 --> 02:37:04.725
Quintus, sword.

1339
02:37:06.227 --> 02:37:08.020
Give me your sword.

1340
02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:13.442
Sword! Give me a sword!

1341
02:37:14.944 --> 02:37:18.447
Sheathe your swords.
Sheathe your swords!

1342
02:39:33.916 --> 02:39:35.251
Maximus.

1343
02:39:40.631 --> 02:39:41.924
Maximus.

1344
02:39:42.508 --> 02:39:43.843
Quintus.

1345
02:39:45.511 --> 02:39:46.971
Free my men.

1346
02:39:48.347 --> 02:39:51.058
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1347
02:39:52.351 --> 02:39:54.437
There was a dream that was Rome.

1348
02:39:55.104 --> 02:39:56.981
It shall be realized.

1349
02:39:57.523 --> 02:40:00.109
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1350
02:40:01.193 --> 02:40:03.195
Free the prisoners. Go!

1351
02:40:27.970 --> 02:40:29.305
Maximus.

1352
02:40:31.182 --> 02:40:32.767
Lucius is safe.

1353
02:40:49.075 --> 02:40:50.493
Go to them.

1354
02:41:40.292 --> 02:41:41.710
You're home.

1355
02:42:08.362 --> 02:42:10.906
Is Rome worth one good man's life?

1356
02:42:14.785 --> 02:42:16.579
We believed it once.

1357
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:21.917
Make us believe it again.

1358
02:42:25.421 --> 02:42:27.506
He was a soldier of Rome.

1359
02:42:31.343 --> 02:42:32.761
Honor him.

1360
02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:35.389
Who will help me carry him?

1361
02:43:20.142 --> 02:43:21.810
Now we are free.

1362
02:43:28.192 --> 02:43:30.069
I will see you again.

1363
02:43:32.947 --> 02:43:34.406
But not yet.

1364
02:43:35.407 --> 02:43:36.742
Not yet.
