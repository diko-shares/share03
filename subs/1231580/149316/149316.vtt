WEBVTT

1
00:01:37,772 --> 00:01:39,633
Uh, excuse me!

2
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,652
Sorry to bother you.
We're trying to find The Furze.

3
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,070
The Furze.

4
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:48,115
Good heavens!
Could you be Ms. Barton's new tenants?

5
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:50,117
- Right.
- How exciting!

6
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:51,994
Gerry Burton. My sister, Joanna.

7
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,121
Well, I never. Maud Calthrop.

8
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:55,789
My husband's Vicar here.

9
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,958
He'll be expecting to see you
in church on Sunday.

10
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,544
Everyone will.
They're all dying to meet you.

11
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:02,338
Oh, Lord. Suppose we disappoint them?

12
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:04,173
Oh, I'm quite sure you won't.

13
00:02:04,174 --> 00:02:05,507
Now, let me tell you.

14
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:07,760
The Furze, straight through the village,

15
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:10,966
about half a mile, turn left
and there you are.

16
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:21,785
How very nice to see you both!

17
00:02:21,858 --> 00:02:23,150
And welcome to The Furze.

18
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:24,401
- Oh, thank you.
- Thanks.

19
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:25,962
- Beatrice!
- Oh!

20
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:27,729
GERRY: Thank you very much.
EMILY: Shall I?

21
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,177
Come along, girl!
Go get them bags out of the car.

22
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:38,874
I do hope you'll both be happy here.
I'm so fond of it.

23
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,043
Well, after all,
I've lived here all my life.

24
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,962
You get used to things, don't you?

25
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:46,507
Oh, dear! I can't help feeling
we're driving you out.

26
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:50,052
Oh, but you mustn't!
It's the war, taxation.

27
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:53,055
The cost of everything nowadays.
The upkeep.

28
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,599
I simply had to do something.

29
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,143
Besides, it won't be forever.

30
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,271
Now, Partridge is staying on
to look after you.

31
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:04,684
She's a cook, housekeeper
and a treasure.

32
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,611
And then, there's Beatrice.
She's the maid and all that.

33
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:10,781
Uh, not very experienced, but willing.

34
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:13,867
A gardener, Cleat,
who comes in twice a week,

35
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:18,419
has a strange wife,
but you don't need to see much of her.

36
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,920
Do forgive me, Mr. Burton,
but were you hurt during the war?

37
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,256
No, no. Not a scratch actually, no.

38
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:29,883
That was a test flight
for a new jet.

39
00:03:29,884 --> 00:03:31,260
Both engines blew at 30,000.

40
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,129
Then the ejector gear malfunctioned.

41
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,755
I managed to bring her down all right,

42
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,682
but I hit the deck pretty hard.

43
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,267
Pretty lucky, I suppose.

44
00:03:38,268 --> 00:03:41,145
Oh! Yes, I... I see.

45
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:42,938
Uh, he's trying to tell you, Ms. Barton,

46
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,065
that he crashed his plane.

47
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:48,426
Good heavens! I'm sorry.

48
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,330
You'll have to let Owen Griffith,
our nice doctor, take care of you.

49
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:53,941
Oh, I believe the hospital
has already been in touch with him.

50
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,160
Good. He's Welsh, of course.

51
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:58,454
But the Welsh are so clever,
aren't they?

52
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:00,039
And Partridge is an excellent cook.

53
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,572
She'll help you build up your strength.

54
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,627
Oh, no, no. Never in this house.

55
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:07,171
Oh, I'm sorry.

56
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:09,256
Oh, no. You mustn't be.

57
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:10,591
It's just that...

58
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:13,052
Well, smoking never occurred to me.

59
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,888
Oh, don't worry.
I'll see he has lots of ashtrays.

60
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,139
It's so silly of me.

61
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,850
It all comes of never
having a man about the place.

62
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,810
The last one was my eldest sister's beau

63
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:24,021
and he didn't last long.

64
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:26,482
- Mother took exception.
- To his smoking?

65
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:27,983
To his accent.

66
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:30,486
"Wasn't quite a gentleman," she said.

67
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,640
I thought he was rather nice. Jolly.

68
00:04:33,656 --> 00:04:36,450
Dephne fretted,
but, uh, as Mother told her,

69
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:37,868
you never know with men.

70
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:39,471
Know what, Ms. Barton?

71
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,623
Another cup of tea, my dear?

72
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,001
JOANNA: Thanks so much.

73
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:49,171
Mr. Burton, do forgive me
if I don't offer you something stronger.

74
00:04:49,172 --> 00:04:51,032
Men prefer that, don't they?

75
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:52,716
I remember my father did,

76
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:55,095
but Mother took exception to that, too.

77
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:59,473
Didn't approve,
wouldn't allow it in the house.

78
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,179
Poor Father.

79
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:03,440
And poor Mother.

80
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:06,313
But she was an invalid, you see.

81
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:10,191
She always managed
to have her own way.

82
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:16,365
VICAR: The peace of God be with you

83
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:20,761
and remain with you always.

84
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:24,099
- Amen.
- Amen.

85
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:40,264
Good morning. Mr. and Mrs. Cleat.

86
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:41,974
I'm glad you could make it this time.

87
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:46,228
Vicar, what a simply splendid sermon!
Did Maud choose the text?

88
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:48,021
- She must have.
- She did not.

89
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,983
St. Paul, wasn't it,
"Let brotherly love continue"?

90
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,986
Had... Had you our newcomers in mind?

91
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,737
Indeed. Should you encourage it?

92
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,656
Not sure I know what you're getting at.

93
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,074
Paul goes on to say, doesn't he,

94
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,451
"Be not forgetful
to entertain strangers,

95
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:04,580
"for thereby some have entertained
angels unawares?"

96
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,206
Oh, how delicious!

97
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,417
Somewhat mutilated,
the male angel, perhaps.

98
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:11,336
But the girl, she's quite a sensation,
wouldn't you say?

99
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,818
I trust not. Ah!

100
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,301
Guy, I don't think you've met
Squadron Leader Burton,

101
00:06:17,302 --> 00:06:18,594
and his sister, have you?

102
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,037
No, delighted to see you here.

103
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,363
- Thank you, Padre.
- Thank you.

104
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,223
This is a near neighbor
of yours, Mr. Pye.

105
00:06:23,224 --> 00:06:24,725
Never believe a word he tells you.

106
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:27,311
He spends his whole time laughing
at the rest of us.

107
00:06:27,312 --> 00:06:30,647
Dear lady, how unfair, unkind, untrue.

108
00:06:30,648 --> 00:06:32,174
Despite the malicious Maud,

109
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,876
you'll come and take a sherry with me
at Priory Lodge, won't you?

110
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,117
We'd love to.

111
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,365
Look at her
makin' up to that old Mr. Pye!

112
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:43,285
Yeah, painted up to the eyeballs, too.

113
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,620
And in church.

114
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:46,371
And soon. Promise?

115
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,789
Promise.

116
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,030
Oh, dear.

117
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,752
Symmington brood cometh. I must away.

118
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:54,713
- Squadron Leader, you're on parade.
- Right.

119
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,217
- Ms. Burton, you are an event!

120
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,699
Sleepy, old Lymston's
going to love you!

121
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:03,284
- Bye-bye. Bye.
- Bye.

122
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:07,684
Now, boys, run ahead with Elsie,
will you? We shan't be long.

123
00:07:07,685 --> 00:07:10,020
Here, off we go, then.

124
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,147
Elsie, Elsie, I'm terribly hungry.

125
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,440
ELSIE: You're just greedy.

126
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:15,567
Oh. Elsie, my shoelace.

127
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:19,404
GUY: Maud, you said absolutely nothing
about my sermon.

128
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,073
Does that mean you have no complaints?

129
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:24,701
MAUD: Oh, much better, dear,
and still a trifle long, perhaps.

130
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:26,411
I didn't see anyone asleep.

131
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,538
You're wearing
the wrong specs, Guy.

132
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:31,500
- Your reading glasses.
- But they're so stiff.

133
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:32,626
Come on, Robert.

134
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:34,303
Dozing, I fear, many of them.

135
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:35,754
ELSIE: Come on.
GUY: Good heavens!

136
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,339
Let's go and have some lunch. Shall we?

137
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:40,717
See you lunchtime.

138
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:42,217
Megan!

139
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,721
Oh, just look at that girl's stockings.

140
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,945
A large potato in each heel.

141
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:49,467
What a graceless child.

142
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,855
Yes, Guy, the sermon was wonderful,

143
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,357
but still a little long winded.

144
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,567
- EDWARD: Good morning.
- Ah, Mr. Symmington!

145
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:59,194
How nice to see you again.

146
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:00,988
- And Mrs. Symmington?
- How do you do?

147
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:03,232
Oh, Gerry, Mr. Symmington
is Ms. Barton's solicitor.

148
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,616
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

149
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,068
And there's still something
Gerry has to sign, isn't there?

150
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,178
Oh, there's no hurry.

151
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,247
Next time you're in the High Street,
just drop in.

152
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:11,331
Right. I will do.

153
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:12,958
Edward, we'd better be moving.

154
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,418
The boys will be starving.

155
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:15,836
Righty-ho.

156
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:18,714
Well, it's nice to have you both here.

157
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:21,717
See you again, soon. Guy, Maud.

158
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,164
Edward.

159
00:08:41,404 --> 00:08:43,572
- Gerry.
- Mmm-hmm?

160
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:44,990
You know something?

161
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,784
I have a feeling that Lymston's doing
you a power of good.

162
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:50,037
That was supposed to be
the general idea, wasn't it?

163
00:08:50,038 --> 00:08:51,204
It was.

164
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:52,331
So?

165
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,708
Well, remembering
all those pretty nurses at the hospital

166
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:55,917
who fussed and fretted

167
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,628
and soothed your fevered brow
for months on end

168
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,130
and to what purpose?

169
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,758
Well, apart from their job
had they a purpose?

170
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,094
Whatever. You remained
totally indifferent.

171
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:09,042
But 10 days in Lymston and, um...

172
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:11,850
What the hell are you talking about?

173
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,268
Church last Sunday.

174
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,354
The Symmingtons' nurse governess.

175
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:17,397
Don't think I didn't notice.

176
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:19,608
You're getting better,
my darling brother.

177
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:22,710
You do talk the most awful rubbish.

178
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:26,990
Mind you, the talent
isn't exactly thick on the ground.

179
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:31,076
And say, I had to choose
between her and Partridge.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,429
Oh, thank you very much.

181
00:09:38,836 --> 00:09:41,004
Uh, had you thought about lunch, Miss?

182
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,547
Oh, gosh, I hadn't.

183
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:44,508
You think about it for me,
will you, Partridge?

184
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:47,511
Well, if that's what you want, Miss.

185
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:51,431
There. They'll cheer you up,
letters from abandoned lovers.

186
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:53,141
Two of them are bills, Gerry.

187
00:09:53,142 --> 00:09:55,416
Oh, well, can't win 'em all.

188
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,425
- What the devil's this?
- You tell me.

189
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:10,271
My God!

190
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:15,872
It's one of those...

191
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:19,285
What are they called...
Poison pen letters!

192
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,754
It's filthy, absolutely disgusting!

193
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,673
No! Oh, do let's see!

194
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,466
No, no, Jo. I'm not sure you'd want to.

195
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:28,586
But I do! Please.

196
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,291
All right.

197
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:35,225
Are they always like this?

198
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,144
Well, how in hell should I know?

199
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,062
Well, what shall we do?

200
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,562
Simple.

201
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:46,695
And I thought they rather
liked us down here.

202
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:48,238
Seems somebody doesn't.

203
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:49,865
But what kind of person?

204
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:52,325
It's a nutcase. It must be. Forget it.

205
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:53,670
Okay.

206
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:57,764
But surely there's someone
we should talk to?

207
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,343
Jane! Over here, dear!

208
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,463
Oh, there you are!

209
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:15,713
So sorry I was late.

210
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,852
But it's wonderful to see you.

211
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:20,920
Oh, jump in, dear.

212
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:31,110
Very well.

213
00:11:36,871 --> 00:11:39,300
PARTRIDGE: Best answer that, Beatrice!

214
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:47,505
Ah, Doctor. Come on in.

215
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,800
Morning, Beatrice.

216
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:52,093
Behaving yourself?

217
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:54,179
Only when I has to, Doctor.

218
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,834
I'll just let him know.

219
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,527
Dr. Griffith, sir, called to see you.

220
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:10,695
No, don't get up. On my rounds.
Thought it was time we met.

221
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,531
Owen Griffith, your local quack.

222
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:13,949
Good to see you, Doctor.

223
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,784
Well, I'm supposed to keep
an eye on you.

224
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:18,453
Your doctor wants
weekly progress reports.

225
00:12:18,454 --> 00:12:20,205
Well, you'd better ask Joanna
about that.

226
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,415
She seems to think
I'm doing pretty well.

227
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:23,959
Ah. Done some nursing, have you?

228
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,253
He's sending me up, Doctor.

229
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:28,004
We looked for you in church last Sunday.

230
00:12:28,005 --> 00:12:29,130
Did you, now?

231
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:31,800
Well, at chapel, you see,
my sister and me.

232
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,510
We don't pray with the big nobs.

233
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,062
Foreigners, if you like.

234
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:37,614
Now, I'd like to give you the once over,
if that's convenient.

235
00:12:37,615 --> 00:12:40,141
Right. I'm off, Doctor.
Take good care of him, won't you?

236
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:41,589
Hmm, that's my job.

237
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,814
- And, um, come and see us again soon.
- Once a week.

238
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:49,485
And don't forget,
we're foreigners, too. Bye.

239
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:59,944
- Breathe in.

240
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,122
Been here long, Doc?

241
00:13:02,123 --> 00:13:04,914
Breathe in again. Seven years.

242
00:13:06,168 --> 00:13:09,115
- And still a stranger?

243
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:12,315
Well, I wasn't born here, you see.

244
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:16,754
But they're good. Kindly people, mostly.

245
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:18,263
Who wouldn't write

246
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:21,433
unpleasant, untruthful, ugly letters
about people, would you say?

247
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,018
- You've had one, have you?
- Mmm-hmm.

248
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,395
- In circulation, are they?
- Forgive me, uh...

249
00:13:25,396 --> 00:13:28,273
May I ask what it said, or shouldn't I?

250
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,692
Why not? No one apparently is deceived.

251
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:32,527
Uh, the young lady you've just met

252
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:36,573
is a tart, a trollop
and certainly not my sister.

253
00:13:36,574 --> 00:13:38,867
Oh, I give you, of course,
the expurgated version.

254
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:40,368
Well, indeed, I'm sorry.

255
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,437
I hope she's not too upset?

256
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:46,249
Jo spent two years on a fighter station.
She's case-hardened.

257
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,375
Upset? No.

258
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,002
But just a nasty taste in her mouth.

259
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:50,737
Hmm. I can imagine.

260
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:52,514
- Ribs still painful?
- Only when I laugh.

261
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,716
Well, you haven't got
much to laugh about, have you?

262
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:58,594
...Right. Let's have a look at the legs.

263
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:03,436
Sit down.

264
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:10,607
These letters, Doctor,
have there been others?

265
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,158
- Yes.
- Who to?

266
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,903
- Me for one.
- To you?

267
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,713
And why not?

268
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,617
The writer is pathological
and indiscriminate.

269
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,452
Push hard, please.

270
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:25,997
Scattering the shot far and wide.
And that is worrying.

271
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,248
Why?

272
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:29,793
Well, someone who just can't take it
might get hit.

273
00:14:29,794 --> 00:14:32,688
Push again. Someone vulnerable.

274
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,854
And that could be dangerous.

275
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,776
Stand up, please.

276
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,097
Yeah. Your right leg is a bit wasted.

277
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,700
Oh, okay.

278
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,977
Exercise it. Throw away
one of those sticks, will you?

279
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:49,145
- Yeah.
- "Arise, and walk,"

280
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:50,939
as the good book says.

281
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,108
So here endeth the first lesson.

282
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,228
See you next week.

283
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:56,911
Doctor...

284
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,864
These letters,

285
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,700
are they much the same thing?

286
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:04,703
Well, I can tell you about mine.

287
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:08,915
Accused me of violating
my professional relationship,

288
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,918
of loose conduct
with certain lady patients.

289
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,629
The sexual detail was extremely lurid.

290
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,965
That is usual, of course.

291
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,175
What was the handwriting like?

292
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,927
There was no handwriting.

293
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,470
The envelope was typewritten.

294
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,890
And the letter was just printed words
cut out of an old book

295
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,308
and pasted onto a sheet of paper.

296
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:28,652
That's it. Mine, too.

297
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:31,020
The work of some complete illiterate,
I would imagine.

298
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:32,675
Would you?

299
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:35,508
See you next week.

300
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,197
Maud's told you all about it, Jane?

301
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:42,824
Oh, yes, indeed.

302
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:45,034
Yes, it must be very worrying for you.

303
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:46,911
- Very.
- Here you are.

304
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,083
Oh, thank you so much.

305
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,000
Now, Jane, excuse me
if I leave you to Maud.

306
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:54,419
I have to prepare
the weekly sleeping pill.

307
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,546
Oh, yes. Of course, Guy.

308
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:59,507
Oh, I've taken St. Paul's warning
on the flesh and the devil.

309
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:02,469
"For to be carnally minded is death."

310
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,637
Appropriate I thought
in the circumstances.

311
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:06,890
And I would have thought,
suitably discouraging.

312
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:08,389
Keep it short, dear.

313
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:12,228
Well, now, Maud,
when did all this start?

314
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:14,647
Oh, hard to say.
The villagers scandalize,

315
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:17,491
but hate scandals
when they find themselves involved.

316
00:16:17,693 --> 00:16:22,697
Don't like others knowing
they've received, well, dirty letters.

317
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:24,240
For fear the neighbors might say,

318
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:26,451
there's no smoke without fire,
is that it?

319
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,869
Exactly.

320
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,663
Not that anything remains a secret
for long in Lymston.

321
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,541
No, but poor Guy. What is he accused of?

322
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,293
Oh, something quite disgraceful,

323
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,587
with one of the women
who does the altar flowers.

324
00:16:37,588 --> 00:16:39,214
Well, he was flabbergasted.

325
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,674
Shocked, devastated! Poor dear.

326
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,343
How shameful!

327
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:45,470
Well, you know Guy
almost as well as I do.

328
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:50,331
Absolutely no taste for fornication,
none whatsoever.

329
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,143
- I almost wish he had.
- Really, Maud.

330
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,103
A little worldly spice
added to his sermons

331
00:16:54,104 --> 00:16:55,522
might make them more interesting.

332
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:58,191
Well, you married a cleric, my dear,
a classical scholar.

333
00:16:58,192 --> 00:17:02,362
And I've yet to find such a combination
with a robust appetite for sin.

334
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:04,792
Oh, I find that most reassuring.

335
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,815
Well, now, Maud, what do you want of me?

336
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,579
Well, it's not in your league, dear.
I know.

337
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,289
No dead bodies, no gunshots.

338
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,874
- No blunt instruments.
- Really, Maud.

339
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,977
Not even a shadow of Scotland Yard.

340
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:19,921
Just a lot of unhappy people.

341
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,840
I know you can help.

342
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:24,373
You mean, find the lady?

343
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:26,597
If it is one, yes.

344
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:29,193
Yes. Yes, of course.

345
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:41,484
Are you all right?

346
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,914
Yes, thanks. Hello.

347
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,030
- Hello.
- You're Mr. Burton, aren't you?

348
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,249
- Yes.
- Saw you after church.

349
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,827
- Was that your wife with you?
- Hmm? No, no, no, my sister.

350
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,496
Oh. I'm Megan. Saw you were alone.

351
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:55,248
Thought I'd stop and walk with you.

352
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:56,791
Had to fall off my bike, of course.

353
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:59,419
Never mind. Nice of you.

354
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,254
Look, I see you've torn your stocking.

355
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,631
Gosh. So I have. Doesn't matter.

356
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:05,383
It will once you've left school.

357
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,759
I've left school!

358
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,803
Oh, you have? Forgive me.

359
00:18:08,804 --> 00:18:11,014
How old do you think I am?

360
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,432
Ah, the truth game.

361
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:13,641
I'm 20.

362
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:15,643
Sorry, again.

363
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:19,063
You think I ought to be more
like your sister, all dolled up.

364
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,815
No, I don't.

365
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:22,984
She's awfully pretty.

366
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,361
Isn't a bit like you, is she?

367
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:27,280
Well, she's clean and presentable.

368
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:30,227
And not a bit like me, you mean?

369
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,204
You're a pilot, aren't you?

370
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:36,911
Hmm. I was.

371
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:39,459
Will you always be a bit of a crock?

372
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,734
According to my doctor, no.

373
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:44,005
I was afraid you looked bad-tempered

374
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:45,840
because you were crocked up for life.

375
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:47,508
Bad-tempered?

376
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:49,594
Well, irritable then.

377
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,638
It's only because I'm in a hurry
to get fit again.

378
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,723
Aren't you ever in a hurry
for things to happen?

379
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,224
Not much point.

380
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:57,143
Nothing ever happens. Not to me.

381
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:59,062
Oh, but, surely
your mother and your father...

382
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:02,899
My father's not my father.
He's my stepfather.

383
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,553
Ah, is he?

384
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,861
We never mention my real father.

385
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:09,781
Disgraced himself,
it seems. Disappeared.

386
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:11,558
Then Mummy married Mr. Symmington.

387
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,784
You've met him, haven't you?

388
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:16,704
Yes. Anyway, all's well that ends well.

389
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:17,956
You think?

390
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,375
Not sure he likes me very much.

391
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,585
Not sure Mummy does either
for that matter.

392
00:19:22,586 --> 00:19:24,545
Now, you're being morbid, girl.

393
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:25,880
Am I?

394
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:28,672
Fact is, I'm a bit of a bore I suppose.

395
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:33,653
And before I start boring you,
I'd better be off. Bye!

396
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,943
I just don't know what we do
with the girl, Edward.

397
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:49,580
- She's young.
- She's 20.

398
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,740
And, if I may say so, your problem.

399
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:54,195
Thank you.

400
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,511
Oh, no. I'm sorry, my dear.
I didn't mean it like that.

401
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:59,080
It's just that being
a stepfather, it's...

402
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,833
Makes it difficult for you
to say what you really feel?

403
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,084
Yes, sometimes.

404
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,293
Well, not for me.

405
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:06,421
I've our boys to consider.

406
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,506
She wanders off by herself.

407
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:10,299
She's always late for meals.

408
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,260
Makes no attempt
to help Elsie in the nursery

409
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:13,511
and dresses like a tramp!

410
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,597
What sort of example is that for them?

411
00:20:16,598 --> 00:20:20,010
She's just
as her father was, disruptive.

412
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:30,445
Oh, good morning.

413
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,321
I wonder could you help me.

414
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:34,490
Which Mr. Symmington do I ask for?

415
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:36,559
There is only one.

416
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,912
Oh, but I thought I read "Symmington,
Galbraith and Symmington."

417
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:43,499
Oh, the first Mr. Symmington
was the present Mr. Symmington's father.

418
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,584
He's dead.

419
00:20:44,585 --> 00:20:47,003
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

420
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:49,589
Well, perhaps, I might see
the present Mr. Symmington?

421
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,841
He's engaged at the moment.
Can I help you?

422
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:53,634
Oh, no, thank you. Thank you so much.

423
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:54,886
No, it's a church matter.

424
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:57,230
But, uh, well, perhaps, I might wait?

425
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:59,298
- Yes, of course. Do sit down.
- Thank you so much.

426
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,466
I'll just let him know.

427
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,486
Oh, how very kind.

428
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,938
Would you say Ms. Marple, Jane Marple?

429
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:08,441
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

430
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:11,699
Excuse me, sir. A Ms. Jane Marple.

431
00:21:13,113 --> 00:21:16,657
Won't keep you long, Ms. Marple.
He has Mrs. Symmington with him.

432
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:19,760
Oh. Well, then we mustn't disturb them,
must we?

433
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:23,831
You know, I always think
that working in a solicitor's office

434
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,641
must prove most rewarding.

435
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,834
Oh, it is.

436
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:30,004
All those different people,
different problems

437
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:31,923
and finding solutions for them.

438
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:34,634
Well, Mr. Symmington's the one
who does all that.

439
00:21:34,635 --> 00:21:37,595
- And does he?
- Yes. He's really marvelous.

440
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,722
Very patient, very kind.

441
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,099
Simply wonderful with people.

442
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,753
Really?

443
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,629
Ms. Marple?

444
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:48,227
- Do come in.
- Thank you so much.

445
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:51,984
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Please sit down.

446
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:56,030
Oh, no. It's I who should be asking
forgiveness for interrupting a busy man.

447
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:58,950
Not at all.
My wife tells me you've already met.

448
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:02,203
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
Last year at the Vicarage.

449
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:04,038
Yes, how are you?

450
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,125
And how is that most
interesting daughter of yours, Megan?

451
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,668
Oh, my poor Megan?

452
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:10,943
At the awkward age I'm afraid.

453
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:13,756
Oh, but she must be
in her early 20s by now?

454
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:16,884
But very young. Quite a child still.

455
00:22:16,885 --> 00:22:19,178
Most mothers think
they grow up too quickly.

456
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:20,930
Not me, Ms. Marple.

457
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:24,058
I only wish she'd do something,
learn something.

458
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,893
Typing, dressmaking,

459
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:28,479
even take a correspondence course.
Anything.

460
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,341
If only she'd get out of...

461
00:22:30,774 --> 00:22:32,376
Out of your home?

462
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:35,611
Oh, most certainly not.
That's the last thing we'd want.

463
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:37,363
Angela would want, isn't it, my dear?

464
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:38,614
Naturally.

465
00:22:38,615 --> 00:22:40,658
Now, I know you ladies like to natter,

466
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,452
but Ms. Marple had a purpose
in coming to see me, so...

467
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:46,205
Yes, of course. Yes. Let... Let me see.
Now, where was I?

468
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:49,917
Yes. Now, Maud Calthrop
wants to remind you

469
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,211
that the Church
Restoration Fund accounts...

470
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:56,090
Have to be completed and submitted
by next Tuesday?

471
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,592
They are. They will be.

472
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,260
Oh, absolutely splendid!

473
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:01,053
Well, in that case, I don't think I...

474
00:23:01,054 --> 00:23:03,606
Oh! There was one other little matter.

475
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,783
- Then I'd better be on my way.
- No, no, no! Please.

476
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,768
No, no. Don't go on my account. No.

477
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:09,645
Private matters in a solicitor's office

478
00:23:09,646 --> 00:23:12,023
are, I know,
as inviolate as a confessional.

479
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,608
No, it was just that I...

480
00:23:13,609 --> 00:23:15,693
I wondered if by any chance

481
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,612
you'd heard
about these anonymous letters

482
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,060
that have been going around?

483
00:23:20,073 --> 00:23:21,830
Uh, come in.

484
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:24,118
Sorry to interrupt, sir.

485
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:27,121
But would it be convenient
if I popped along to the stationers?

486
00:23:27,122 --> 00:23:29,123
We're almost out of copying paper.

487
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,792
Why not, Ms. Ginch? Off you go.
Don't be long, though.

488
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,669
Oh, you'd better leave that door ajar.

489
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,151
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

490
00:23:36,423 --> 00:23:38,424
I'm sorry. Please go on.

491
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,635
Mr. Symmington, as a legal man,

492
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:44,358
what would your advice be to someone
who received such a letter?

493
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:46,944
Take it to the police, immediately.

494
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:48,923
And if they don't?

495
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:52,063
- But they do.
- Do?

496
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,569
Well, at least I did.

497
00:23:53,615 --> 00:23:55,750
Oh, good heavens!
Don't tell me that you yourself...

498
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:57,563
I'm afraid so.

499
00:23:57,611 --> 00:24:00,821
Oh. Well, forgive
an inquisitive old lady, Mr. Symmington,

500
00:24:00,822 --> 00:24:03,449
but, uh, what was the police response?

501
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,992
Amiable.

502
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:07,203
Came from our own solid Sergeant Fowler.

503
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:09,538
Not to get excited.
It's probably some spinster lady

504
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,090
getting a little overheated.

505
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,377
I didn't enquire exactly
what he meant by that.

506
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:17,583
Oh. So, he assumes
that the writer is a woman?

507
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:21,346
Well, nine times out of 10
they are, apparently.

508
00:24:21,385 --> 00:24:24,021
Oh, yes. Yes, I see.

509
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:28,182
Yes. That would account
for all those letters

510
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:32,695
that I seem to know about
being addressed to men. Yes.

511
00:24:32,696 --> 00:24:34,172
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

512
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,399
Thank you for giving me
so much of your valuable time.

513
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,650
- Well, goodbye.
- Not at all.

514
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,563
ANGELA: Goodbye, Ms. Marple.

515
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,613
Oh. May I just say this?
I do congratulate you

516
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:44,657
on your choice of secretary.

517
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:46,784
Nowadays it's so rare

518
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,495
to hear an employee speak
so warmly of an employer.

519
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:52,957
Edward seems to inspire hero worship,
Ms. Marple.

520
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,252
I rather had that impression. Goodbye.

521
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:58,475
Goodbye, Ms. Marple.

522
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,221
- So, you made it?
- Mmm-hmm.

523
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:10,641
There and back?

524
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,561
Apart from a sit-down
in Symmington's office, that's all.

525
00:25:13,562 --> 00:25:15,629
- Meet anyone?
- Mmm.

526
00:25:15,689 --> 00:25:16,797
All of Lymston.

527
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,374
And nearly knocked down
into the bargain.

528
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,525
How?

529
00:25:19,526 --> 00:25:22,007
GERRY: Oh,
the Symmington girl on a bicycle.

530
00:25:22,237 --> 00:25:24,322
That the Megan we've heard about?

531
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:27,476
Mmm. Funny girl.

532
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,913
I hope, Mr. Burton,

533
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:35,374
if you'll excuse the liberty,
but I'd like a word.

534
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:37,877
- Mmm. Of course.
- It's Beatrice, sir.

535
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:39,118
Beatrice?

536
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:40,921
Yes, Mr. Burton. She'll have to go.

537
00:25:40,922 --> 00:25:42,473
Go where?

538
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,799
Leave.

539
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,040
Oh, but why?

540
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,386
'Cause of these letters, sir.

541
00:25:47,387 --> 00:25:51,599
Wicked, they are.
Indecent, too, using such words!

542
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,288
Worse than what I've ever read
in the Bible even.

543
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,063
Mind you, I know
there were no truths in them.

544
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,106
And you with them bad legs and all.

545
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:02,735
Me? What are you talking about?
Has Beatrice received...

546
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:04,612
No, sir. George have.

547
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:07,823
George down the garage.
Two of them's walking out.

548
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:11,961
And there are no smoke without fire.
That's what he told her.

549
00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:14,229
So I says, "Better you go, girl."

550
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,539
What will the poor kid do?

551
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,959
Oh, she's all right.
She's fixed up nice.

552
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,295
The Symmington maid
were married off last month.

553
00:26:21,296 --> 00:26:23,631
So now, they've took Beatrice on.

554
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:24,799
But how about you?

555
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,591
Oh, I'll manage somehow.

556
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:29,228
Well, I'm damned.

557
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:31,138
She was always
such a bright, little thing.

558
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:35,267
Yes. Well,
she'll be better off with them.

559
00:26:35,268 --> 00:26:36,922
There ain't no young men around.

560
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:40,382
I'll take it.

561
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:42,803
Partridge?

562
00:26:43,985 --> 00:26:45,444
Yes, Mr. Burton?

563
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:48,155
These letters,
people must have some idea.

564
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,689
- Oh, they have.
- Have they?

565
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,952
They have indeed.

566
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:54,078
And do you mark my words,

567
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,414
there's going to be a mischief,
sooner or later.

568
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,791
You'll see. Folk get violent...

569
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:00,167
Oh, come on, Partridge.

570
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:01,293
In their feelings, sir.

571
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:03,295
But you can't take it that seriously.

572
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,006
There's plenty who's do, sir.

573
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:08,426
Young George down the garage,
for instance.

574
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:12,045
So, who's the frontrunner,
the prime suspect?

575
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:16,434
Well, I'm not one for gossip, sir,
as well you know.

576
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:19,478
But there's those that do say
it's Mrs. Cleat.

577
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,772
Cleat, the gardener's wife?

578
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,978
Oh, she's more than that, Mr. Burton.

579
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:30,239
Exercise, long walks,
no rich food, no pastry.

580
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,908
You are prescribing,
of course, prison fare, Owen.

581
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:35,536
I am prescribing better health
and a lower blood pressure.

582
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:37,191
But boring.

583
00:27:37,205 --> 00:27:39,748
Ms. Griffith,
your brother's being very cruel.

584
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:41,750
To be kind, Mr. Pye.

585
00:27:41,751 --> 00:27:44,211
Owen, you're like
that awful Bernard Shaw.

586
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:45,963
What did Oscar say?

587
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:49,300
"He has no enemies
and all his friends hate him."

588
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:51,677
Good day to the pair of you.

589
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:54,054
Oh, very witty, Mr. Pye.

590
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:55,473
He's the boring one.

591
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,849
Right, that's the lot?

592
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,767
Yes, appointments.

593
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:00,267
Thanks.

594
00:28:01,605 --> 00:28:02,948
Hmm.

595
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,941
Oh, what's this, "Burton, Tuesday"?

596
00:28:05,942 --> 00:28:08,527
Phoned. Said he'd come in,
save you a journey.

597
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:10,279
Good. Must be feeling better.

598
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,907
- Nice, is he?
- Hmm. Pleasant sort of chap.

599
00:28:12,908 --> 00:28:15,601
- Lot of talk about his sister, I hear.
- Is that so?

600
00:28:15,602 --> 00:28:18,245
Tarts herself up like one of these
fashion models, doesn't she?

601
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,872
Mmm, I wouldn't say that.

602
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:22,416
Rather attractive, as a matter of fact.

603
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,294
No. On reflection, very attractive.

604
00:28:25,295 --> 00:28:26,629
Men!

605
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,422
Oh, Lord. No more gossip.

606
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:29,632
Last visit.

607
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:30,841
ERYL: And I know who to.

608
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,676
Oh, uh, did you make up
that prescription?

609
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,434
Here it is.

610
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,430
"Mrs. Symmington, the sedative.

611
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:38,649
"One to be taken, midday
and before retiring."

612
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,518
- Bless you, Eryl.
- There's nothing wrong

613
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:43,521
with the woman a good dose
of common sense wouldn't cure.

614
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,189
She's very nervy and neurotic.

615
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,982
And a nuisance to everyone.

616
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:48,484
To you, her family.

617
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:50,444
She needs support, Eryl.

618
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:52,461
Indeed, she does.

619
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:56,200
Oh, that poor man, her husband!

620
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,035
He's the one I feel sorry for.

621
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,245
Look, woman.

622
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:02,206
When we first came here,
Symmington was very helpful.

623
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,583
Very kind to both of us, I know that.

624
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:08,773
And I know you've also had
a very soft spot for him.

625
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,048
Whatever do you mean?

626
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,426
Owen, what do you take me for?

627
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:15,970
He's a married man!

628
00:29:15,971 --> 00:29:18,090
That's right, Eryl.

629
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,534
Oh, come now.

630
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,980
Get on the phone
to The Cricketers, woman.

631
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:27,479
I'm taking you out tonight.

632
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,480
Shan't be long.

633
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:44,718
Oh. A delicious sherry, Mr. Pye.

634
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,460
And, if I may say so,
an exquisite house.

635
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,920
Indeed you may, dear lady.

636
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,548
But then, you appreciate
the importance of beauty.

637
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:54,675
As do our young friends here.

638
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:57,136
Alas, very rare in these parts.

639
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:59,471
Here, where every prospect pleases.

640
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:01,265
And only man is vile?

641
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,058
Much worse. Dull!

642
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,747
Unbearably, impossibly dull.

643
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,939
Oh, I don't know.
I think the villagers are rather fun.

644
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,191
The generosity of youth, my dear.

645
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:12,693
But I... I didn't mean the rustics.

646
00:30:12,694 --> 00:30:14,028
You can excuse them.

647
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:16,196
They... They live,
work and play amid pigsties

648
00:30:16,197 --> 00:30:18,407
with a permanent smell of manure
in their nostrils.

649
00:30:18,408 --> 00:30:20,743
No. I... I meant
those who should know better.

650
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:22,661
Those with money and no taste,

651
00:30:22,662 --> 00:30:24,580
arrogance and no sensibility,

652
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:27,333
minds devoid of imagination.

653
00:30:27,334 --> 00:30:29,209
Ugly, ugly, ugly people.

654
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,544
But you!

655
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:32,630
You I claim as kindred spirits.

656
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:36,133
You are as eloquent, Mr. Pye,
as you are gracious as a host.

657
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,719
Dear Ms. Marple,
what a charming compliment.

658
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,972
If perhaps a little severe
on your fellow men.

659
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,349
What I don't understand, sir, is

660
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,675
why are you settled here
in the first place?

661
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:46,769
What were you looking for?

662
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,372
Sanctuary.

663
00:30:48,438 --> 00:30:49,563
Not quite sure I follow.

664
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:51,106
From the war.

665
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:55,194
Those terrifying doodlebugs,
the dust and dirt.

666
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:57,972
The smell of all those bodies
sheltering in the underground.

667
00:30:57,973 --> 00:30:59,740
I... I'm not a brave man,
Squadron Leader.

668
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,575
And it would be folly
to pretend otherwise.

669
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:05,120
Bombs frighten me.
I abominate all violence.

670
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:07,247
So, you left London, was it?

671
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:08,666
I did indeed.

672
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:11,251
What with the Yanks,
and all their GI brides-to-be,

673
00:31:11,252 --> 00:31:13,462
running an antique shop
in the King's Road, Chelsea,

674
00:31:13,463 --> 00:31:15,255
became quite intolerable.

675
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:17,169
And when my...

676
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:20,803
My partner chose
to disappear into the blue,

677
00:31:20,804 --> 00:31:21,929
that was it.

678
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:23,972
London could take it, I couldn't.

679
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,989
I sold up, fled!

680
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,434
And here I am.

681
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:28,894
Oh, dear.

682
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:31,522
I think that's rather
a sad, little tale.

683
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,983
Ah! Beauty and sympathy
in combination, irresistible.

684
00:31:34,984 --> 00:31:36,985
Another glass of sherry wine?

685
00:31:36,986 --> 00:31:40,698
Oh, you haven't told us, Mr. Pye.
Did you find sanctuary?

686
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,618
I did, dear lady. Here. In this house.

687
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:46,286
Nowhere else.

688
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:48,539
Certainly not with my neighbors.

689
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,883
Oh.

690
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,625
Oh, forgive my ignorance,

691
00:31:51,626 --> 00:31:55,421
but isn't that just a little limiting?

692
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:57,464
Not if you have a passion for beauty.

693
00:31:57,465 --> 00:32:00,718
And... And don't you find
that houses can be passionate?

694
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:04,596
Oh, yes. How interesting!
It hadn't occurred to me.

695
00:32:04,597 --> 00:32:07,141
For example, uh, take Emily Barton.

696
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:09,309
- Ms. Barton?
- That house you're in.

697
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,811
I mean, what... What is it?

698
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:13,105
Nothing but a monument
to her mother's perversions.

699
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:15,774
A cold fortress
against the masculine ego.

700
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:17,943
I wouldn't know about that.

701
00:32:17,944 --> 00:32:19,153
Warping.

702
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:21,238
She doesn't seem very warped.

703
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:24,392
Well, scarred. Underneath, scarred.

704
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:28,829
Had it not occurred to you,
those P.P. letters?

705
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,164
P.P.?

706
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,508
Poison pen.

707
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:35,252
Surely you're not suggesting Ms. Barton?

708
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,088
Appearances can be deceptive, of course.

709
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,339
Can't they just?

710
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,050
And how about that girl
down at the surgery?

711
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:44,887
The receptionist, the Doctor's sister?

712
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:48,557
All that Welsh passion expended
in polishing her ugly lino.

713
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,185
Oh. But surely, somebody else does that?

714
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:53,479
Possibly. But it's a thought,
Ms. Marple.

715
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,024
Would... Would you not say
another candidate for our P.P. lady?

716
00:32:57,025 --> 00:32:58,776
So... So secretive!

717
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,527
And those flashing eyes!

718
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:03,322
Wow! She sounds quite a dish.

719
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:04,448
Ms. Marple?

720
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,532
Oh. Oh, no, thank you.

721
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:08,368
No, really, how should
I face the Vicar at lunch?

722
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,704
Uh, but tell me, Mr. Pye,

723
00:33:10,705 --> 00:33:14,170
um, talking of the P.P. letters,

724
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:16,029
do tell me,

725
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:18,848
have you ever received one yourself?

726
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:21,455
Me?

727
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:25,469
Whatever have I to hide
that might interest the writer?

728
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,675
Oh, I'm sure I don't know, Mr. Pye.

729
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:38,690
George!

730
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:41,534
George, you were supposed to meet me
at the bus stop!

731
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,695
Well, I changed my mind, didn't I?

732
00:33:43,696 --> 00:33:46,074
Why? Just tell me, why?

733
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:47,241
Reckon you know.

734
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,117
Oh, don't be so daft.

735
00:33:49,118 --> 00:33:50,994
You're muckin' up my one day off!

736
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,701
Yours, too!

737
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:54,456
Don't care.

738
00:33:54,457 --> 00:33:57,417
Look, it weren't my fault
you getting that letter, were it?

739
00:33:57,418 --> 00:33:59,211
- Weren't it?
- I told you.

740
00:33:59,212 --> 00:34:01,463
He's a cripple, walks on sticks.

741
00:34:01,464 --> 00:34:03,173
What can he do?

742
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,299
He can look at you.

743
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,510
But I've left the place.

744
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,638
Know what you are, don't you? Barmy!

745
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,224
Yeah? I knows what you are...

746
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:14,476
Well, thank you very much, George Ellis!

747
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:15,853
If that's what you think of me,

748
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:18,105
I'd best go straight back
to the Symmingtons'!

749
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:22,036
If you change that mind of yours again,
that's where you'll find me.

750
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,268
- Hello!
- Megan!

751
00:34:45,508 --> 00:34:48,558
Hello to you! Where are you off to?

752
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,347
Nowhere special. Just cycling around.

753
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:53,588
Then come in.

754
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:56,703
Come on!

755
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,216
You sure?

756
00:34:59,856 --> 00:35:01,871
Joanna's around somewhere.

757
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,318
I have darned my stockings.

758
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:07,631
Have you? Good show.

759
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:11,408
Well, are you or aren't you?
Will you or won't you?

760
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,327
Perhaps, your sister's busy.

761
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:15,602
She's not and she wants to meet you.

762
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,149
Can't see why.

763
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:23,003
- Here we are.
- Well done.

764
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,422
Any girl who throws herself
at my brother's feet.

765
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,299
She fell off her bicycle, Jo.

766
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,763
You told me. Here.

767
00:35:31,012 --> 00:35:32,717
Not another.

768
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:34,306
What is it?

769
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:35,933
- Dry martini.
- What's that?

770
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,017
A cocktail.

771
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:38,936
I've never had cocktails before.

772
00:35:38,937 --> 00:35:40,538
They lift you up.

773
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:43,500
- Makes me dizzy.

774
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,193
Suspect you think I'm awful.

775
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:48,111
Unspeakable. What're you doing about it?

776
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,456
Tell me what do you think?

777
00:35:50,198 --> 00:35:52,416
Darling, I think
you're a breath of fresh air.

778
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:54,117
And you and I are gonna be great pals.

779
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,243
Hmm.

780
00:35:55,244 --> 00:35:57,004
Everyone else thinks I'm stupid.

781
00:35:57,005 --> 00:35:58,997
Oh, for goodness sake,
stop imagining things.

782
00:35:58,998 --> 00:36:01,375
I know what goes on in their minds.

783
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:02,616
In your mind.

784
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,336
I'm not wanted, you know.

785
00:36:04,337 --> 00:36:06,249
Mummy doesn't like me one bit.

786
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:08,715
Now, you're being morbid again, child.

787
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:11,927
And I'm not a child. She doesn't.

788
00:36:11,928 --> 00:36:13,428
I remind her of Daddy.

789
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:17,391
She'd like it to be just herself
and the boys and their father.

790
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:19,101
Megan, darling, why don't you...

791
00:36:19,102 --> 00:36:20,704
Well, couldn't you just leave?

792
00:36:20,812 --> 00:36:22,980
To do what? I'm quite useless.

793
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:24,898
No money, no training.

794
00:36:24,899 --> 00:36:27,109
It's true, no one would miss me.

795
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:30,445
I would. I'd miss those
holier-than-thou stockings of yours.

796
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,990
There you are, you see. I'm just a slob!

797
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:34,574
That isn't true.

798
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:36,493
That's what everyone believes.

799
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,412
That's why I hate Lymston.

800
00:36:38,413 --> 00:36:40,747
Hate the house I live in,
hate my mother,

801
00:36:40,748 --> 00:36:42,660
hate everyone, everything!

802
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,210
Well, that's pretty comprehensive, so...

803
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,434
I'd better be going.

804
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:50,048
Thanks, Joanna, thanks very much.

805
00:36:50,049 --> 00:36:51,842
- My dear girl...
- For heaven's sake,

806
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,678
stop being so superior, so patronizing!

807
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,333
Patronizing?

808
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:58,557
I'm sorry.

809
00:36:58,558 --> 00:37:01,659
Anyway, thanks, to both of you.

810
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,104
So what did I say?

811
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:10,148
Do you think she'll be all right?

812
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:12,320
My God, that girl's a problem child!

813
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:14,544
Not a child, a woman.

814
00:37:14,991 --> 00:37:16,450
And now, she has another problem.

815
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:18,118
Hmm? What's that?

816
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,652
Oh, dear. Can't you guess?

817
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,372
- I'm away, Ms. Ginch.
- Goodnight, sir.

818
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:06,625
Oh. That conveyance
on the Alderton property.

819
00:38:06,626 --> 00:38:09,002
I'll have it ready in the morning,
Mr. Symmington.

820
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:11,691
Fine. I'll see you tomorrow.

821
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,929
Back to the table, Robert. At once.

822
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,555
No one's said you could get down.

823
00:38:20,556 --> 00:38:23,517
And, James, don't wave your knife
around like that.

824
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:26,412
What would Mummy say if she saw you?

825
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,582
Daddy's home.

826
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:34,152
Now, sit up properly, both of you,
and behave yourselves.

827
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:36,530
Oh, Robert, you've got jam
all over your face. Here.

828
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:37,822
Fishy face.

829
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:03,023
Oh.

830
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:04,891
Daddy, Daddy,
we want to show you something!

831
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,193
- Now, then, boys!
- Daddy, I want to show you something.

832
00:39:07,194 --> 00:39:09,037
Hey!
Back up, there, back up there!

833
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:10,689
You're pulling me apart!

834
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:12,399
What have you two monsters been up to?

835
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,067
We went down to the river.

836
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:16,069
And look what we caught, Daddy.

837
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,310
Yes, look, Daddy!

838
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:20,532
Look, here they are, Daddy.

839
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,992
Oh, they're tiddlers.

840
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,577
Where's the shark?

841
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:26,413
You can't catch sharks in the river.

842
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,206
Don't be stupid, Daddy.

843
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:31,677
Sharks like warm water.
Sharks would freeze in cold water.

844
00:39:31,678 --> 00:39:33,728
- Wouldn't they, Robert?
- Have you seen my wife?

845
00:39:33,729 --> 00:39:36,089
Oh, still resting I think,
Mr. Symmington.

846
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,257
Still?

847
00:39:37,258 --> 00:39:39,843
Well, she wasn't downstairs
when we arrived home.

848
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,937
- Look, I caught that.
- Well, I'll have...

849
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:44,039
Try and squeeze another cup
out of that pot, Elsie.

850
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,799
- Now, that's not fair!
- Help her wake up.

851
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,767
You'll have three. I'll have none.

852
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:49,102
ROBERT: That's more like it.

853
00:39:49,103 --> 00:39:51,288
- No, they're not!
- You know, you really are noisy.

854
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:53,857
You stand six inches apart.
You have to shout at each other.

855
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,563
Calm down.

856
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:57,253
I'll be back in a minute.

857
00:39:57,403 --> 00:39:59,779
Come on, boys, and help me clear up.
It's bath time soon.

858
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,313
...Come on.

859
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,401
Elsie!

860
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,840
Ms. Holland!

861
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,467
Mr. Symmington! What is it?

862
00:40:46,827 --> 00:40:48,274
What's the matter?

863
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:51,844
Whatever made you choose
this color, Jane?

864
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:53,917
Do you disapprove?

865
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:56,294
I don't comment. I enquire.

866
00:40:56,295 --> 00:40:58,255
Well, it's not for me, Guy.

867
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,271
It's for my baby goddaughter.

868
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:12,978
Hello, the Vicarage.

869
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:15,304
Yes, Maud Calthrop speaking.

870
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:18,011
Good evening, Ms. Holland.

871
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:21,933
Oh, dear Lord!

872
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,623
No!

873
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,868
Yes, of course.

874
00:41:28,869 --> 00:41:31,092
My husband will come over immediately.

875
00:41:40,923 --> 00:41:43,973
It's Angela Symmington.

876
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:45,903
Oh, dear!

877
00:41:47,555 --> 00:41:49,932
She's not dead, is she?

878
00:42:56,624 --> 00:42:58,226
- Morning.
- Morning.

879
00:42:59,251 --> 00:43:00,543
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

880
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:07,150
CORONER: Uh,
just one moment, Superintendent,

881
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,270
I'd like to make a note of that.

882
00:43:18,396 --> 00:43:21,564
I am most obliged, Superintendent.
Carry on, please.

883
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:24,442
The police have established
the following, sir.

884
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:28,029
"Mr. Symmington had returned
to his office shortly after lunch.

885
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:32,283
"Ms. Holland had taken the two boys off
for a walk and a picnic.

886
00:43:32,284 --> 00:43:35,453
"Mrs. Symmington's daughter, Megan,
went cycling.

887
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:39,416
"And the two servants had left
because it was their half day off.

888
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:41,167
"Mrs. Symmington was alone in the house

889
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:43,128
"when the letter was delivered."

890
00:43:43,129 --> 00:43:44,420
By post?

891
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,714
By hand. There was no stamp.

892
00:43:46,715 --> 00:43:48,111
Hmm.

893
00:43:49,969 --> 00:43:52,178
This, uh, potassium cyanide,

894
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:53,730
do we know where it came from?

895
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:55,598
It seems the potting shed.

896
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,350
There had been a plague of wasps.

897
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:00,603
The gardener was using it
to destroy the nests.

898
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,879
Thank you, Superintendent.

899
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:06,985
And, Doctor, how would you describe

900
00:44:06,986 --> 00:44:09,529
the dead woman's
general state of health?

901
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:13,032
She had a nervous condition
which I was treating.

902
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:16,244
With these sedatives she took daily?

903
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:19,372
Would you consider her a neurotic?

904
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:23,001
OWEN: Well, she suffered
from nervous disorder, yes.

905
00:44:23,002 --> 00:44:25,628
And on receiving a letter of this kind

906
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:28,423
what, in your estimation,
would be its effect on her?

907
00:44:28,424 --> 00:44:32,677
It would, in my judgment,
prove a great shock.

908
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:35,388
Even destabilizing,
would you say?

909
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:37,612
Quite possibly.

910
00:44:40,436 --> 00:44:43,188
On reading that letter,
can there be any doubt

911
00:44:43,189 --> 00:44:46,733
that this poor woman was thrown
into a state of extreme agitation?

912
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,401
She went out into the garden,

913
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:49,903
she found the cyanide,

914
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:52,405
took some back into the house,

915
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:55,408
threw it into a glass
containing her usual sedative

916
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:57,243
and then drank it

917
00:44:57,244 --> 00:45:00,413
after writing those last tragic words,

918
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:02,378
"I can't go on."

919
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:06,794
The writer of that wicked letter
is morally guilty of murder.

920
00:45:06,795 --> 00:45:09,088
And the police, I know,
will not relax their efforts

921
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:11,622
until this culprit is apprehended.

922
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,801
This court finds that

923
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:16,346
Angela Margaret Symmington
did take her own life

924
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:20,069
whilst the balance of her mind
was disturbed.

925
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:38,643
Hey, Megan, wait!

926
00:45:45,334 --> 00:45:47,091
Come along.

927
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:55,838
Mr. Symmington.

928
00:45:55,844 --> 00:45:57,136
Edward.

929
00:45:57,471 --> 00:45:59,332
I'm so sorry.

930
00:45:59,682 --> 00:46:03,226
How terrible for you,
all that coming out of the letter!

931
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:07,932
I just hope whoever
it is can sleep nights.

932
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:10,815
If there is anything I can do.

933
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,527
I know. Thank you.

934
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:20,660
Mr. Symmington,
I'd better get back to the boys.

935
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:23,913
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
I... I must stay.

936
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,602
I have to thank the Coroner.

937
00:46:27,626 --> 00:46:30,503
Bad it is. Very bad.

938
00:46:30,504 --> 00:46:34,140
Well, you shouldn't have left that there
cyanide lying round, Arthur Cleat.

939
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:36,075
- Should you?
- Here, never you go blaming me!

940
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:37,844
You blame them wasps!

941
00:46:37,845 --> 00:46:42,098
Ms. Partridge. I... I...

942
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,391
What, girl?

943
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:46,853
Tomorrow afternoon,
could I come and see you?

944
00:46:46,854 --> 00:46:48,187
Just for a chat?

945
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:50,356
What you been up to now then, eh?

946
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:52,483
Nothing, Ms. Partridge.

947
00:46:52,484 --> 00:46:54,193
But I do have something on my mind.

948
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:56,279
Oh! You do, do you?

949
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,781
- Something bothering at me.
- Mmm-hmm.

950
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,409
Remember when I had that row
with George?

951
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,370
The day all this happened, you know?

952
00:47:04,371 --> 00:47:08,818
My stars! I wish now I'd never went
to that there house.

953
00:47:14,423 --> 00:47:17,266
I just feel so alone now, Guy.

954
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,213
I'm not sure I can face it.

955
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,330
You will.

956
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:25,558
You must, for the boys' sake.

957
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:26,643
Without Angela?

958
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:28,194
I know, Edward.

959
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:31,042
Look.

960
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,430
Owen believed it was cyanide.

961
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:37,816
There had to be a reason, Edward.

962
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,407
That letter. That damn, filthy letter!

963
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:42,700
Saying what?

964
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:48,754
That our youngest, Jamie,
wasn't my child.

965
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,583
And whoever wrote it
was going to tell the world

966
00:47:50,584 --> 00:47:51,793
who the real father was.

967
00:47:51,794 --> 00:47:53,853
I mean, it was all nonsense.
It's sheer nonsense.

968
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:56,063
Guy, you know, he was our child!
You christened him!

969
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:58,287
Of course, of course.

970
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,308
If only I'd been with her.

971
00:48:04,598 --> 00:48:05,942
If only someone...

972
00:48:12,439 --> 00:48:14,507
If only she hadn't been alone.

973
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:21,864
Guy will look after him. That's his job.

974
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:23,783
There's nothing more we can do.

975
00:48:23,784 --> 00:48:25,893
Selfish and silly she may have been,

976
00:48:25,894 --> 00:48:28,162
but I can hardly think
she was the kind of woman to...

977
00:48:28,163 --> 00:48:29,747
To take her own life?

978
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:33,988
But the note, "I can't go on,"
and cyanide.

979
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:37,066
Yes.

980
00:48:37,506 --> 00:48:40,842
Perhaps, I should have seen
and understood sooner.

981
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:42,468
What, Jane?

982
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:45,680
Maud, my dear, I'm afraid.

983
00:48:45,681 --> 00:48:46,931
Of what?

984
00:48:46,932 --> 00:48:49,361
That it was not suicide.

985
00:48:49,977 --> 00:48:51,941
You can't mean...

986
00:48:52,312 --> 00:48:53,980
You can't, Jane!

987
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:56,315
But who would want to...

988
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:57,918
Kill her?

989
00:48:58,277 --> 00:49:01,792
Well, that we've yet
to find out, my dear.
