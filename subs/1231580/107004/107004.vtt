00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:34.940
We are back!

3
00:00:43.373 --> 00:00:44.158
Let's go!

4
00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:49.729
Nuts!

5
00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.786
Gimme the Black Beauty.

6
00:01:56.044 --> 00:01:59.075
Alvin, take it easy up there.
You've got to share the spotlight.

7
00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:00.351
You got it, Dave.

8
00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:07.423
- Dave.
- I'm serious, Alvin. This is a charity benefit.

9
00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:11.010
- It's not all about you.
- Sorry,Dave. I can't hear you ...

10
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.343
over the thousands of fans
screaming my name.

11
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.781
I've got  this.

12
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.992
I need a help, boys.

13
00:02:44.055 --> 00:02:46.283
Alvin, will you please get down from there.

14
00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.820
I can't hear you.

15
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:52.286
- Alvin, I'm not kidding.
- What?

16
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:03.574
- Dave, look out!
- Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

17
00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:10.683
Oh, Dave. Dave?

18
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:16.189
This should help with the pain.

19
00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:18.676
I wannna talk to my boys.

20
00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:23.203
I just gave you a sedative
that will take effect in about one minute, so...

21
00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:26.881
But, let them in, quickly.

22
00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:32.464
- Dave!
- You are alive! - Hey guys!

23
00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:34.974
- It was an accident. I swear.
- Are you OK?

24
00:03:35.187 --> 00:03:38.034
- I'm really sorry, Dave.
- I'll be fine.

25
00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.340
I'm just gonna be stucked here for a while.

26
00:03:40.813 --> 00:03:45.199
And until I get out, I made arrangements for
my aunt Jackie to come and stay with you.

27
00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.425
Who is Aunt Jackie?

28
00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:50.241
The one who sent us those mail package of
yummy popcorns for Christmas.

29
00:03:50.243 --> 00:03:53.497
- Popcorn Jackie.
- You don't have much time Mr Seville.

30
00:03:53.498 --> 00:03:57.365
Listen, I want you guys to go home
and live a normal childhood.

31
00:03:59.497 --> 00:04:03.868
I even made arrangement
for you to go to school.

32
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.827
- School?
- Yes, school.

33
00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:10.351
Simon, I'm putting you in charge.

34
00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:15.450
- You are?
- I'm counting on you.

35
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:18.769
Dave, wait a minute.
Why is he in charge?

36
00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:22.563
- He's counting on me.
- Dave, please, don't die.

37
00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:24.601
He just sleeping.
He had a sedative.

38
00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:27.233
Ah, a sedative.

39
00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.254
Excuse me, I'm here to escort
the Chipmunks home.

40
00:04:30.256 --> 00:04:33.941
We are not leaving Dave.
I'm putting my paw down on this one.

41
00:04:33.942 --> 00:04:35.300
You come here.

42
00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:41.188
I got it! I'll fix it! No, made it worse.

43
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.425
Please, please go.

44
00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:48.567
More stress you put on persistent
the longer will take him to recover.

45
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.626
You are too slow, nanny.

46
00:04:52.627 --> 00:05:01.206
You'll never hit me! I'm not going anywhere without Daaa...
...aaaydream believer, and a homecoming queen...

47
00:05:03.402 --> 00:05:08.050
I hope for your sake
he stays asleep for the entire flight.

48
00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:11.918
Maybe you should give him another shot.
Just to be sure.

49
00:05:21.895 --> 00:05:24.171
Any ideas on how we gonna find aunt Jackie?

50
00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:26.426
Follow me.

51
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.454
Excuse me. Sorry.

52
00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:32.855
Excuse me, got you.

53
00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:37.958
- Look, aunt Jackie! Aunt Jackie!
- Popcorn Jackie.

54
00:05:38.058 --> 00:05:40.509
- Oh,come on dears.
- Yeah, we got you.

55
00:05:40.609 --> 00:05:42.661
- Popcorn!
- Who's sending to Theodore's?

56
00:05:43.017 --> 00:05:46.170
Oh, there is a plenty for everyone.
Give a hug first.

57
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:48.817
Come over here, you old teddy bear.

58
00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.509
I'm not really much of a hugger.

59
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.633
Oh, boys, I want you to meet someone.
This is my grandson Toby. Toby?

60
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:58.514
Hi, I'm Theodore.

61
00:05:58.515 --> 00:06:01.124
- Toby?!
- What, what happened?

62
00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:04.609
- The boys!
- Oh, hey! Hey,how are you? I'm Toby. Nice to meet you.

63
00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:08.090
Toby is living with me 'til he figures out
what he want to do with his life.

64
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:11.544
So far that means going peeoo-peeoo-peeoo
with his thumbs the all day.

65
00:06:12.102 --> 00:06:17.126
For the record goin' peeoo-peeoo-peeoo with my thumbs right now
is keeping me in first place, and that's important.

66
00:06:17.234 --> 00:06:19.168
- Toby get the bags.
- What bags?

67
00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.967
- The lighters. Get the luggages.
- Oh, the lug, right. Let me get those...

68
00:06:25.266 --> 00:06:28.890
- Toby!
- Get the brake! Get the brake!

69
00:06:35.426 --> 00:06:36.658
I'm fine.Don't worry!

70
00:06:43.104 --> 00:06:46.276
I'm so sorry, aunt Jackie. I'm so sorry.
Is she goin' to be ok?

71
00:06:46.277 --> 00:06:49.267
Don't worry about me, I will be home with no time.

72
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.531
I wanna be so sure.

73
00:06:53.434 --> 00:06:56.293
It was an accident, I swear.

74
00:06:56.294 --> 00:06:59.191
Been there, done that.
Several times.

75
00:06:59.192 --> 00:07:01.603
I guess he's been taking care of us now?

76
00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:04.295
I'll take frankly offer of five hundred, he's nuts.

77
00:07:04.522 --> 00:07:07.390
Ain't no problem. I can totally do this.

78
00:07:07.392 --> 00:07:11.343
I mean, I took care of my cat...
until it ran away.

79
00:07:11.344 --> 00:07:15.227
Well, 'ran away' is kind of strong wordin',
I think he just wanted his space.

80
00:07:15.228 --> 00:07:18.701
I still see him around neighbourhood.

81
00:07:18.702 --> 00:07:23.412
You know, he like hisses and claws at me.
but I think that's his way of saying we're still tight, you know.

82
00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:29.130
You guys are nothing to worry about, seriously.
'Cause, I'm not gonna be like Dave, you know, Dave is gone.

83
00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:31.359
Gone?

84
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:34.895
Not gone, not gone gone.
He is not dead. He's very much alive.

85
00:07:34.896 --> 00:07:38.179
He completely coming back.
I'm just gonna be in his room, keepin' his bed warm.

86
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.189
I'll be doin'my thing,you'll be doin' your thing.
I mean, you don't need to know that I'm there.

87
00:07:42.242 --> 00:07:47.077
We supposed to know that you there,
that's the whole idea.

88
00:07:47.079 --> 00:07:54.671
Yeah, ok absolutely. You know that I'm there,I'm just...
I'm not gonna be like: I know everything, and you do this, and you do that.

89
00:07:55.043 --> 00:07:56.103
I mean that.

90
00:07:57.147 --> 00:08:00.154
All right, let's do this.

91
00:08:01.327 --> 00:08:01.860
Oh, boy!

92
00:08:11.648 --> 00:08:14.685
Theodore, we gonna be just fine.

93
00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:19.082
The important thing is...we're all still alive.

94
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:22.708
Well, maybe my "Get Well" card will
help Dave to come faster.

95
00:08:23.618 --> 00:08:26.692
It needs just a touch more glitter.

96
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:33.326
That should do it.
Who's hungry?

97
00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.443
- Uh, uh me, me!
- Let's eat.

98
00:08:36.444 --> 00:08:39.463
Nada. Find anything?

99
00:08:39.562 --> 00:08:42.258
It's a food ghost town in here. Alvin?

100
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.717
Hello, the cheese balls are in the heat house.

101
00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:17.580
Bingo. Dinner, she is a served.

102
00:09:19.116 --> 00:09:21.141
Hey, what are you doing in here?

103
00:09:21.663 --> 00:09:23.758
A cheese ball?

104
00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:26.543
Thumb boy, give me a second, real quick.

105
00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:32.708
Alvin, I really need to focus, right now
because I'm one knockout away from my heavy weight title.

106
00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:35.295
Can we play as well?

107
00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:41.947
You know, I don't want to  hurt your feelings, but else
you don't want see anyone get hurt and there gonna be fistsufferean flyin'.

108
00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:43.616
We can play monopoly.

109
00:09:43.617 --> 00:09:45.995
We play monopoly with Dave all the time.

110
00:09:45.996 --> 00:09:48.613
Do you? That sounds funny.
We should do that sometime right.

111
00:09:48.662 --> 00:09:51.570
Now, I got to back and floatin' like
a butterfly and stinging like the bee.

112
00:09:54.852 --> 00:09:58.489
Who needs Toby, Theodore, you got us.

113
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.615
Yeah, who needs Toby? Boys, right this way.

114
00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:23.660
I'm gonna puke.

115
00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:28.572
Do you know what Dave would
say if he were here right now?

116
00:10:28.573 --> 00:10:32.399
I think it comes more from the belly.

117
00:10:39.317 --> 00:10:41.836
Get together.
Be cool.

118
00:10:42.617 --> 00:10:45.389
- Helllooooo?
- Boys, it's me.

119
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:47.899
Dave?

120
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.559
Well, I guess since you've answered the phone,
you haven't burned down the house yet.

121
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.791
- Have a little faith, Dave.
- Yes.

122
00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:55.039
Mayday!

123
00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:00.543
- What was that?
- Don't stress him out.

124
00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:06.179
- Oh, that was... Aunt Jackie.
- Yeah, she's making us a tasty five-course meal.

125
00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:09.420
Really? Can I talk to her?

126
00:11:09.422 --> 00:11:12.272
She's practising her pole dancing.

127
00:11:12.272 --> 00:11:15.938
Pole dancing?
But, what happened with making dinner. Guys, what's going on?

128
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.568
- Gotta go, Dave.
- Alvin, I'm not kidding!

129
00:11:18.568 --> 00:11:21.378
- Get better!
- Alviiiiiiiiinnn!!!

130
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:24.788
Yep, nobody does that better than him.

131
00:11:54.983 --> 00:11:58.026
Toby, Toby wake up.

132
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:06.239
- Sorry.
- No, that's okay. What is it?

133
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.219
- I had a nightmare.
- Oh, the nightmares.I hate the nightmares.

134
00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:12.267
What was it?

135
00:12:12.268 --> 00:12:16.516
I dreamt that we didn't have a family anymore.

136
00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:21.893
Theodore, that couldn't happen.
No, you guys are tight.

137
00:12:21.894 --> 00:12:24.524
Nothing could ever separate you.

138
00:12:24.525 --> 00:12:29.473
Less like an eagle swooped down from the sky like caw-caaaw!

139
00:12:33.153 --> 00:12:37.957
Which couldn't happen ever.
Why would you think that ever happened, you know...

140
00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.770
The Eagles are in Philadelphia.

141
00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:43.802
Sweet dreams.

142
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.148
- Toby, make it stop.
- What are you doing?

143
00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.217
There is something wrong with the clock.
It won't shut up.

144
00:12:57.218 --> 00:12:59.621
I can't sleep.

145
00:12:59.622 --> 00:13:04.240
That's the point.
It's an alarm clock.

146
00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:06.833
It helps you wake up early in the morning.

147
00:13:06.834 --> 00:13:09.091
Why would anyone wanna wake up early?

148
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:12.054
For the school, you got to be there by eight.

149
00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:15.296
- In the morning?
- Look, I don't like any others early anything more than you do.

150
00:13:15.395 --> 00:13:21.530
But we are in this together, Alvin.
Soon you get to school, soon I get to compound and get back to sleep.

151
00:13:22.252 --> 00:13:25.959
- You mean you don't stayin' with us in school?
- No, no , no.

152
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.064
I've done my time making very much.

153
00:13:28.065 --> 00:13:33.172
- But school is fun, right?
- Fun? Well, i guess Maybe, it's... fun-ish..

154
00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:36.703
Hey, it's my cat!

155
00:13:36.738 --> 00:13:40.757
Hey kiddy it's me, remember?

156
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:47.258
I treated you good.

157
00:14:07.843 --> 00:14:10.283
There, here we go.

158
00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:14.939
Enjoy your first day in school.
See you around three-ish.

159
00:14:22.086 --> 00:14:25.908
We got it.This got to be a walk in the park.

160
00:14:27.151 --> 00:14:29.575
I'm frightening.

161
00:14:30.433 --> 00:14:33.893
Hi, I'm Theodore.

162
00:14:34.532 --> 00:14:37.761
Hi, I'm Theodore.

163
00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:48.205
- Eagle.
- Go eagle!

164
00:14:55.746 --> 00:14:58.721
That wasn't very fun-ish.

165
00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:03.804
You must be our new students.
I'm Dr Rubin, the principal.

166
00:15:03.805 --> 00:15:06.072
And we are the Chipmunks.

167
00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:10.029
Yeah, that will explain the fur and booshy tales.

168
00:15:10.031 --> 00:15:12.703
- Follow me, gentlemen.
- Gentlemen?

169
00:15:12.704 --> 00:15:15.274
Oh, us. Right.

170
00:15:15.276 --> 00:15:17.831
There was a minute left and
we were down by two ...

171
00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:21.430
And I mind couch: I don't care if my leg is broken,
put me in, I can win this...

172
00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:24.009
I never get tired of that story.

173
00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.384
So I hobbled out barely able to stand...

174
00:15:26.386 --> 00:15:28.771
Did I mention my leg was broken?

175
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:31.075
- Mrs Ortega?
- Yes?

176
00:15:31.429 --> 00:15:33.598
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

177
00:15:34.003 --> 00:15:38.375
- Well guys, welcome to home room.
- Good to be here, I hope.

178
00:15:38.475 --> 00:15:40.226
So this is a classroom?

179
00:15:41.226 --> 00:15:44.020
I love the smell of zit cream in the morning.

180
00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:47.868
Hello ladies.

181
00:15:53.106 --> 00:15:56.530
Hi, I'm Theodore. Hi, I'm Theodore.

182
00:15:57.025 --> 00:15:59.664
Yes, he's Theodore in case you missed it.

183
00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:01.423
And I am Simon.

184
00:16:01.433 --> 00:16:05.730
My name Seville, Alvin Seville.

185
00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:09.051
Enchantée... mademoiselle.

186
00:16:11.066 --> 00:16:14.584
Somebody's have to knock these guys down to size.

187
00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:17.852
That should be pretty easy, really.
They are only eight inches tall.

188
00:16:43.603 --> 00:16:49.352
I had 15 cars.
I mean that's like five more cars than anybody really needs.

189
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:55.170
I had seven maids.
Courtside seats to the Lakers.

190
00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:59.365
Even my maids had courstside seats to the Lakers.

191
00:17:00.078 --> 00:17:02.390
Now, look at me.

192
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:05.201
Look at me.
I lost everything.

193
00:17:05.739 --> 00:17:08.828
Except for my dignity,
they can't take that away from me.

194
00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:13.327
And it's all because of them.

195
00:17:15.994 --> 00:17:18.218
Oh, hey ...crackers.

196
00:17:18.469 --> 00:17:22.484
Now run around, hoping and praying
that I could find other animals that can ...

197
00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:24.914
sing or dance.

198
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:28.335
Wait a second, you don't sing, do you?

199
00:17:28.708 --> 00:17:33.581
Hey, hey that's my muffin.
Give me my muffin! You dirty rat.

200
00:17:36.967 --> 00:17:40.553
I will get you Chimpmunks.

201
00:17:48.683 --> 00:17:51.329
Girls, we have to get out of here.

202
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:53.163
I can't see.

203
00:17:53.418 --> 00:17:56.716
- My nose.
- That's my tail! - Sorry.

204
00:17:56.816 --> 00:18:00.715
- Move your ass.
- Ok. Stop pushing me.

205
00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:08.228
- We made it. - Jets Records!
- Phew!

206
00:18:10.134 --> 00:18:14.554
Oh, my gosh. It's him! Ian Hawke!

207
00:18:14.555 --> 00:18:16.897
Mr Hawke?

208
00:18:17.575 --> 00:18:20.824
That voice! I can't get it out of my head!

209
00:18:21.424 --> 00:18:23.984
Hello, Mr Hawke?

210
00:18:23.985 --> 00:18:27.272
That not in my head, that's really happening.

211
00:18:27.876 --> 00:18:30.689
- What do you want?
- We want to introduce ourselves.

212
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.118
That's right.
I'm Brittany. And this is my sister Eleanor.

213
00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:38.087
Hello, sir. Such a pleasure to meet you!

214
00:18:38.088 --> 00:18:42.406
And I'm their sister Jeanette.
Although I feel more like an Olivia or sometimes....

215
00:18:42.407 --> 00:18:45.552
Anyway, we are the Chipmunk girls.

216
00:18:45.553 --> 00:18:49.486
We will be just so honored to have you to represent us.

217
00:18:49.487 --> 00:18:51.476
You made Alvin and the Chipmunk stars.

218
00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.273
We wanna be stars too, yeah!

219
00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:56.155
And hangin' out with the Chipmunks.

220
00:18:56.156 --> 00:19:00.691
Ok, now listen before we get all girly and giggly
about this, just tell me one thing ...

221
00:19:01.357 --> 00:19:03.858
You can sing, right?

222
00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:09.027
Hang on, not here.

223
00:19:09.028 --> 00:19:13.744
Why not we take this meeting upstairs
in my penthouse office?

224
00:19:14.332 --> 00:19:18.473
This is so exciting.

225
00:19:19.698 --> 00:19:23.306
Oh, my gosh, can you believe it?

226
00:19:23.307 --> 00:19:26.547
My first penthouse office!

227
00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:32.628
Oh, my... the Hollywood sign!

228
00:19:32.629 --> 00:19:34.564
I thought you might like the view!

229
00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:37.814
Ladies, tell me little something about yourselves.

230
00:19:37.815 --> 00:19:41.630
We grew up in a small town,
population 300 and ...

231
00:19:41.632 --> 00:19:44.436
Really? That's fascinating. Great!

232
00:19:44.437 --> 00:19:46.827
All right, impress me!

233
00:19:47.949 --> 00:19:50.979
One, two, three.

234
00:20:24.642 --> 00:20:27.585
Girls, girls, girls.

235
00:20:27.586 --> 00:20:32.120
Guess who just became the number one
Chipmunks' band in whole dang world?

236
00:20:32.121 --> 00:20:34.726
Ian Hawke.

237
00:20:34.726 --> 00:20:38.295
So, when can we meet the Chipmunks?

238
00:20:39.124 --> 00:20:43.990
That's an excellent question
and the excellent answer is...

239
00:20:43.991 --> 00:20:47.998
I don't really represent Alvin and the Chipmunks anymore.

240
00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:51.314
- Oh, no. Wha-what happened?
- Oh, classic tale.

241
00:20:51.315 --> 00:20:54.129
Sweet and innocent when I met them,
they had nothing ...and then I work my butt of

242
00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:57.133
to make them rock stars and...

243
00:20:57.437 --> 00:21:03.035
They changed.
Turned out to be like bad cheese.

244
00:21:03.036 --> 00:21:05.503
- No.
- That's terrible.

245
00:21:05.504 --> 00:21:09.746
I know. I mean, I treated Alvin like my own son, you know.

246
00:21:10.026 --> 00:21:12.872
And he just goes and spits on me.

247
00:21:12.873 --> 00:21:17.619
Literally.
He filled his chipmunk's cheeks with saliva
and just had at it.

248
00:21:17.719 --> 00:21:22.921
- Don't even get me started about Simon.
- But not Theodore, right?

249
00:21:22.957 --> 00:21:25.954
It's the cuddly ones you have to watch for.

250
00:21:25.955 --> 00:21:29.924
But why we are talkin' about them for, c'mon?
They are over, fired, nobledeut (noble death)...

251
00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:32.430
Chipmunks' stupid sayin'.

252
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.235
But ...

253
00:21:35.236 --> 00:21:40.554
Girl Chipmunks' stupid sayin' ...
Fasten your seat belts!

254
00:21:43.189 --> 00:21:47.813
So I eyed Jay Z's eyes right, and I said:
Jay, where is Beyonce?

255
00:21:47.814 --> 00:21:50.521
And he says : She's holding a plate
full of cheese balls, turn around ...

256
00:21:50.522 --> 00:21:52.579
And guess what..

257
00:21:52.679 --> 00:21:56.652
- She was.
- PS, Dave left me in charge.

258
00:21:56.653 --> 00:22:00.315
We stay up to ten every night.

259
00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:03.023
Look what I can do.

260
00:22:03.024 --> 00:22:06.719
You're Theadorable.

261
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:14.105
- I am so sorry.
- That's cool. No harm done.

262
00:22:14.106 --> 00:22:18.025
Not yet.
Girls, please, private conference.

263
00:22:18.864 --> 00:22:21.201
Thank you.

264
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.821
Listen up, rock stars.

265
00:22:27.822 --> 00:22:30.810
If you talk to those girls again
you're dead.

266
00:22:30.811 --> 00:22:33.811
If you look at those girls again
you're dead.

267
00:22:33.812 --> 00:22:37.576
If you even think about those girls...

268
00:22:37.577 --> 00:22:41.165
- Are you thinking about them?
- Well, I am now.

269
00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:44.348
- That's it.
- You are dead!

270
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.963
Get them, c'mon! Crack you, you dirty rats!

271
00:22:51.926 --> 00:22:54.295
Scatter!

272
00:22:55.198 --> 00:22:57.522
- That way. Over there!
- I'm runin'.

273
00:22:59.848 --> 00:23:02.902
Hey Dumbo, catch me if you can.

274
00:23:06.258 --> 00:23:08.832
- You are dead!
- Not!

275
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.707
It's stretching time!

276
00:23:21.082 --> 00:23:23.606
Oh, boy.

277
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.671
Eagle.

278
00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:29.215
- Eagle! Eagle!
- Get him.

279
00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:31.942
- Move! Move!
- This way.

280
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.979
- Gotcha.
- Wait, wait, come up...

281
00:23:34.981 --> 00:23:38.360
- It's swirley time.
- C'mon, c'mon guys, this is not so...

282
00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:41.018
Please, please!

283
00:23:43.814 --> 00:23:46.866
- That's a good look for you!
- Thank you.

284
00:23:48.282 --> 00:23:52.085
- I can't swim. Help.
- Grab on Simon!

285
00:23:58.993 --> 00:24:00.391
You okay?

286
00:24:00.413 --> 00:24:04.146
Well, uh, considering that you just saved me
from drowning in a toilet...

287
00:24:04.154 --> 00:24:06.527
I'm, uh, pretty good.

288
00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:08.638
I'll be right back.

289
00:24:08.639 --> 00:24:11.145
Alvin, Alvin!
We're not gonna solve anything with violence!

290
00:24:11.146 --> 00:24:13.249
- It's the fatty ratty.
- Cut it out!

291
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.238
- This rat has serious junk in the trunk.
- Yeah, little fatty.

292
00:24:24.603 --> 00:24:27.682
Simon, does this make my butt look smaller?

293
00:24:27.683 --> 00:24:31.196
Theodore, your butt looks fine.
Those guys are just some jerks.

294
00:24:41.201 --> 00:24:44.981
You threatened to climb inside of him
and build a nest.

295
00:24:44.982 --> 00:24:49.345
That was out of line and not even sure
that is physically impossible.

296
00:24:50.784 --> 00:24:55.068
- I should suspend all three of you.
- Please do.

297
00:25:03.328 --> 00:25:05.909
Instead I have the better idea.

298
00:25:06.614 --> 00:25:11.825
Due to budget cutbacks ,
we are in jeopardy of loosing our beloved music program.

299
00:25:11.826 --> 00:25:13.703
- That's awful.
- I know.

300
00:25:13.704 --> 00:25:16.272
But, there is one small ray of hope.

301
00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:19.737
Every year the District sponsors a music competition...

302
00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:23.409
And the winner school receives 25,000 dolars.

303
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.723
If we win, we can save our program.

304
00:25:25.724 --> 00:25:28.432
And you want us to perform?

305
00:25:28.433 --> 00:25:31.460
I begin to think that you are a fan?

306
00:25:31.461 --> 00:25:35.366
Why don't you sleep on it.

307
00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.860
- Wait.
- Great.

308
00:25:39.531 --> 00:25:42.065
Promise me that you won't say anything.

309
00:25:42.066 --> 00:25:45.705
The principal has a certain image to uphold.
If Mr Fencle ever finds out about this ta...

310
00:25:46.576 --> 00:25:52.995
I just can't believe this, that you are actually sitting in my office.
I have all of your CDs.

311
00:25:52.996 --> 00:25:56.819
I even went to see you last year in Denver.
That's where I got this.

312
00:25:56.917 --> 00:26:00.008
It was my birthday.
And I was like...Oh, the Chipmunks!

313
00:26:02.592 --> 00:26:07.113
So, what you say?
Will you represent our school?

314
00:26:07.723 --> 00:26:11.659
Honestly suspension sounds pretty good to me.

315
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.113
Come on Alvin?
One for all, and three for one.

316
00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:19.317
Well put, Theodore.Very well put.
Count us in.

317
00:26:19.318 --> 00:26:22.357
Go Eagles!

318
00:26:23.047 --> 00:26:25.381
Eagles? Where?

319
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.588
Ah, the penthouse limo.

320
00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:32.909
Très exclusivo.

321
00:26:35.841 --> 00:26:39.886
Hey, isn't that that Chihuahua?
Ya know, from the movie?

322
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:45.505
Uh, yeah, yeah. I mean, of course it is.
Yeah, a lot of big names live here.

323
00:26:45.507 --> 00:26:48.423
- Oh. Como esta?
- I must have his autograph!

324
00:26:48.424 --> 00:26:51.807
Whoa, whoa, Brittany. You wanna be a star, act like a star.

325
00:26:51.808 --> 00:26:55.887
- You don't get autographs, you give 'em.
- Oh, right.

326
00:26:57.889 --> 00:27:01.092
Hey, look over there, there's a couple of the Jonas Brothers.

327
00:27:01.093 --> 00:27:03.814
- Where? I don't see them.
- Here we are.

328
00:27:04.324 --> 00:27:08.905
Ok, let's scootin' to my apartment ...

329
00:27:08.906 --> 00:27:12.778
What? Did I... Oh, darn it! Darn it to heck!

330
00:27:12.878 --> 00:27:15.227
- What? What's wrong?
- Girls, I apologise but ...

331
00:27:15.228 --> 00:27:18.672
I seem to left my keys back in my office.

332
00:27:19.532 --> 00:27:23.378
What if one of you shroud through that mail
slot and open it up for me from the inside?

333
00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:25.826
I'll do it.

334
00:27:28.213 --> 00:27:30.821
I'm stuck.

335
00:27:32.268 --> 00:27:34.434
All right, I got you, I got you!

336
00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:40.791
Not so hard.

337
00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:43.204
I wanna lay off the nuts.

338
00:27:43.205 --> 00:27:46.123
All right, how about you, glasses?
You are in better shape. Wanna go?

339
00:27:46.123 --> 00:27:49.802
- Well I'm not that good in things like this.
- I got it!

340
00:27:58.435 --> 00:28:01.177
Impressive!

341
00:28:01.178 --> 00:28:03.294
Gee, Willakers!

342
00:28:03.295 --> 00:28:08.103
Great. Bingo! This is the best treehouse ever!

343
00:28:08.104 --> 00:28:10.500
A red piano.

344
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.138
- Is this a dream?
- Stand by and catch me.

345
00:28:14.879 --> 00:28:18.896
- It's much better than a tree!
- I just adore a penthouse view!

346
00:28:19.566 --> 00:28:21.886
Nice one, Hawke.

347
00:28:21.887 --> 00:28:24.571
- You like it?
- Sure, Ian.

348
00:28:24.572 --> 00:28:27.690
- I live here.
- It's so beautiful.

349
00:28:30.672 --> 00:28:33.227
The last time we visited Meerkat Manor ...

350
00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:35.533
Arrival group called the Commanders ...

351
00:28:35.534 --> 00:28:39.269
was making large indoors in to the Whiskers' teritory.

352
00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:50.390
Toby, I thought i was messy,
but this is really disgusting.

353
00:28:50.391 --> 00:28:52.409
I feel like livin' in a dumpster.

354
00:28:53.176 --> 00:28:56.473
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor on it. Watch with me.

355
00:28:57.224 --> 00:29:01.991
You're right.
I thik I'll relax, feelin' my nerves little bit...

356
00:29:01.992 --> 00:29:04.977
What is this?

357
00:29:04.978 --> 00:29:07.923
You got to be joking? A taco.

358
00:29:07.924 --> 00:29:10.598
In a blanket? Toby!

359
00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:17.062
Ladies and gentlemen, goin' for his turkey
is the Tobster.

360
00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:22.019
Come on baby.

361
00:29:27.866 --> 00:29:31.495
No problem.
Watch and learn, my friends.

362
00:29:35.846 --> 00:29:39.192
Oops, broken TV, I think this is the time
to play my second favorite game.

363
00:29:39.193 --> 00:29:42.044
Hide the broken TV from Dave.
You wanna play?

364
00:29:42.657 --> 00:29:45.337
- No!!!
- Go easy on him, Taco Boy.

365
00:29:45.337 --> 00:29:47.649
This day has been bad enough already.

366
00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:53.922
Oh, I think I see what's going on.

367
00:29:53.923 --> 00:29:57.377
- You guys are having some problems at school.
- No, not really ...

368
00:29:57.379 --> 00:30:00.872
Unless you consider, having your head
dumped in public toilet, a problem ...

369
00:30:02.073 --> 00:30:06.740
Squirrelees are the worst.

370
00:30:06.741 --> 00:30:08.817
At least, that's what I heard.

371
00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:13.174
Because, there is no way that I possibly know that,
on a personal level.

372
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.647
Toby, what was school like for you?

373
00:30:53.522 --> 00:30:57.334
- Toby? Tobyyy!!!
- What?

374
00:30:57.369 --> 00:31:00.045
What was school like for me? In a word?

375
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:05.269
Awesome!
But, you know that 'cause I was like ...

376
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:08.728
Extremely popular.

377
00:31:08.729 --> 00:31:12.711
- Is that why you are still live with your grandmother?
- And refer to yourself as Tobster?

378
00:31:12.774 --> 00:31:15.574
And go peeoo-peeoo-peeoo all day?

379
00:31:16.946 --> 00:31:19.426
Bed time.

380
00:31:24.893 --> 00:31:30.180
Alvin! Alvin wake up and turn off the alarm.

381
00:31:34.902 --> 00:31:39.893
Alvin, I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding, buddy, turn it off!

382
00:31:39.895 --> 00:31:42.420
Guys, guys ...

383
00:31:49.335 --> 00:31:51.153
Boys, this isn't funny.

384
00:31:51.155 --> 00:31:54.456
Hello? I need help.

385
00:31:54.457 --> 00:31:57.641
A man got us.
He wants to take us to eternal place.

386
00:31:57.643 --> 00:32:01.031
- School.
- Hello. - Have a heart.

387
00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:04.368
Have a heart. Dave wants you to school,
so you are goin'.

388
00:32:04.369 --> 00:32:08.225
Don't worry about taking us three, Toby.
We gonna be all right.

389
00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:11.564
- If it hurts?
- Guys, come on.

390
00:32:11.565 --> 00:32:14.992
Trust me, the second day is
never as bad as the first.

391
00:32:20.533 --> 00:32:23.515
Glasses! Glasses!
You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would y...

392
00:32:24.321 --> 00:32:27.402
Right in the pancreas.

393
00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:35.368
Nurse?

394
00:32:37.006 --> 00:32:41.920
C'mon, Alvin! Remember the five D's!
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, and dodge!

395
00:32:42.645 --> 00:32:44.794
You're next, furball.

396
00:32:44.795 --> 00:32:47.461
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me?

397
00:32:47.462 --> 00:32:51.341
I'm the only one here, so you must be talkin' to me.

398
00:32:58.325 --> 00:33:01.702
- Did you see that?
- Hallelujah!

399
00:33:01.704 --> 00:33:04.488
Unbelievable, he caught it.
You're out, man.

400
00:33:05.668 --> 00:33:08.501
And the tackle made, she got's in.

401
00:33:09.108 --> 00:33:12.308
- He got hands.
- I think that's paws actually.

402
00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:15.081
We can definitely use him on the team.

403
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.828
Hey, furball, how would you like a spot
in the football team?

404
00:33:18.829 --> 00:33:21.843
- Football? Moi?
- I got to say you're good.

405
00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:24.281
I'm gonna let you hangin' out with us at lunch.

406
00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:27.855
That is, if you wanna be on the team?

407
00:33:27.857 --> 00:33:30.261
- Interesting proposition.
- Alvin?

408
00:33:30.262 --> 00:33:33.641
- Maybe I'll get back to you on that.
- This is a one-time offer.

409
00:33:33.643 --> 00:33:36.530
Don't take too long and think it over .

410
00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:39.372
Great, but I will dish my brothers!

411
00:33:39.374 --> 00:33:43.550
Just to become the first chipmunk ever to
play an actual voice on a football team.

412
00:33:43.551 --> 00:33:46.360
No chance.

413
00:33:46.361 --> 00:33:49.911
The stadium is unanimous.

414
00:33:49.912 --> 00:33:55.136
It stots and goes, it's out, it's out...
and he catches it!

415
00:33:55.137 --> 00:33:57.457
The crowd goes crazy.

416
00:34:02.525 --> 00:34:04.038
Me?

417
00:34:08.695 --> 00:34:12.090
I think that super cool jock table
is paging you.

418
00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.409
Why would I go over there?

419
00:34:14.411 --> 00:34:17.207
Look, if I really need to worry about being popular.

420
00:34:17.207 --> 00:34:21.159
Hello, talking Chipmunk.
World-famous rock star ...

421
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:25.142
Dive with his own flesh doll.
Guys, I'm on pajamas.

422
00:34:25.143 --> 00:34:28.799
Not to toot my own horn bike.

423
00:34:29.443 --> 00:34:33.644
Come on, it's delectable.

424
00:34:33.851 --> 00:34:36.498
- Just go, Alvin.
- Really? You really mean it?

425
00:34:36.498 --> 00:34:39.587
- Yeah.
- Thanks. I'll be right back.

426
00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:44.997
- What's up, geeks?
- What's up, man?

427
00:34:45.441 --> 00:34:48.035
Bring it.

428
00:34:54.215 --> 00:34:59.602
I got it, I got it I...

429
00:34:59.603 --> 00:35:02.462
Not.

430
00:35:02.463 --> 00:35:05.160
- I think he's cute.
- Me too.

431
00:35:05.161 --> 00:35:09.591
Toss.

432
00:35:14.201 --> 00:35:16.360
Call me.

433
00:35:16.361 --> 00:35:20.886
I'm tellin' you, Chipmunks are old news.
I got the next big thing.

434
00:35:20.888 --> 00:35:24.376
Singing female Chipmunks.

435
00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:32.747
God, what part of singing female chipmunks
some of this people do not understand...

436
00:35:35.952 --> 00:35:39.595
Girls, we are goin' to school.

437
00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:43.428
He's up, and he scores.

438
00:35:44.946 --> 00:35:50.226
Hey, right up, ass? Wow, don't hate on a high five?

439
00:35:50.911 --> 00:35:53.230
Yeah, high five.

440
00:35:53.231 --> 00:35:57.984
Look Alvin, I know you've guys been busy with
your sporting gathers and what not...

441
00:35:57.985 --> 00:36:01.829
- But I can really use your help at home.
- Oh, no can do.

442
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:05.043
Ryan is gonna teach me how
to get pretty girls to do my homework.

443
00:36:06.619 --> 00:36:09.824
Alvin, you promised Theodore we hang out.

444
00:36:09.825 --> 00:36:13.224
We are watching Meerkat Manor tonight.
No pretty girls.

445
00:36:13.225 --> 00:36:17.390
- Dude, I can't swing it today.
- That's what you say every day, Alvin.

446
00:36:17.391 --> 00:36:19.831
Not to remind you it's your day to do the laundry.

447
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:23.892
Better listen to your daddy, Alvin.
You don't wanna get grounded?

448
00:36:26.147 --> 00:36:30.740
- Are you going to pick that up?
- Are you going to make me?

449
00:36:30.741 --> 00:36:35.726
Au contraire, mon frere!
I'm just going to elegantly show you how it's done.

450
00:36:39.105 --> 00:36:44.090
Off the glass.
And you call yourself a jar.

451
00:36:48.217 --> 00:36:52.976
My brother, he's a real jokester.
Always do.

452
00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:56.008
I'll see you guys around.

453
00:36:57.709 --> 00:37:00.115
- That's my play.
- That's my play.

454
00:37:01.294 --> 00:37:03.904
Why are you tryin' to embarrass
me in front of my friends?

455
00:37:04.005 --> 00:37:07.016
Are you kidding me?
They are the ones which should be embarrassed by.

456
00:37:07.018 --> 00:37:09.980
- Good luck with the show, guys.
- First row seats. Can't wait!

457
00:37:09.981 --> 00:37:12.237
So, which song are we gonna sing?

458
00:37:12.239 --> 00:37:15.215
No pressure, but the whole school
is counting on us.

459
00:37:15.215 --> 00:37:19.271
Oh, relax! It's like Ryan said:
Who's gonna beat singing chipmunks?

460
00:37:46.408 --> 00:37:49.017
Finally. Oh, Simon is dreamy.

461
00:37:49.118 --> 00:37:52.074
- I think Theodore was looking at me!
- Yeah, I know.

462
00:37:52.075 --> 00:37:55.784
But guys remember what Ian said?
We can't trust them.

463
00:38:17.131 --> 00:38:20.389
- What happened?
- I never thought I'd say this but...

464
00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:25.047
- Pink is my new favourite colour.
- Her glasses were quite fetching.

465
00:38:25.048 --> 00:38:28.204
She's like a beautiful green gumdrop.

466
00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:32.300
If you guys want to do this
you got to pay attention.

467
00:38:32.301 --> 00:38:35.944
- Maybe, this is a good time for us to take a break.
- Good call,take five.

468
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.202
She's right. We need to focus.

469
00:38:40.204 --> 00:38:42.998
This is for my screen saver.

470
00:38:42.999 --> 00:38:47.664
- Hey buzz!
- Hey guys? Are you guys ready to go?

471
00:38:47.664 --> 00:38:49.693
'Cause I've got a lot of important staff
to do at home.

472
00:38:49.721 --> 00:38:54.743
- You must be their guardian?
- God, that I am. Yes I am.

473
00:38:54.779 --> 00:38:59.050
Hi. How are you, Dr Rubin?
I know that because I went to school here a few years ago.

474
00:38:59.051 --> 00:39:03.931
I don't know if you remember me,
Toby Seville probably not...

475
00:39:05.828 --> 00:39:10.391
Toby? No way? Hi! Hey, no braces.

476
00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:15.072
- I think it's great.
- I did ...

477
00:39:15.072 --> 00:39:18.773
I did get the braces off,'cause they were just...

478
00:39:31.115 --> 00:39:36.397
I know a guy who actually works on drum heads.
I'll be in the car, guys.

479
00:39:39.222 --> 00:39:40.941
Somebody is in love.

480
00:39:40.942 --> 00:39:44.793
We are going to replace everything.
Chipmunks' honor.

481
00:39:44.794 --> 00:39:48.573
The old faulse modestly suck up routine.

482
00:39:48.574 --> 00:39:52.587
- I thought I smelled a rat.
- May I help you Mr Hawke?

483
00:39:52.588 --> 00:39:56.372
I was wondering if I could help you,
I just heard about your musical competition ...

484
00:39:56.373 --> 00:39:59.554
and I just get down here as quickly as I could
to volunteer my girls.

485
00:39:59.556 --> 00:40:03.629
That's very thoughtful of you,
but I've already made up my mind.

486
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.587
Perhaps this will change your mind.

487
00:40:07.588 --> 00:40:09.513
Girls.

488
00:40:10.726 --> 00:40:14.120
They are with Ian?

489
00:40:16.388 --> 00:40:19.619
One, two, one, two ...

490
00:40:46.778 --> 00:40:50.810
They're astounding.

491
00:41:24.373 --> 00:41:28.702
Good people of West Eastman, you have
just witnessed the debut...

492
00:41:28.703 --> 00:41:31.625
Of the Chipettes!

493
00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:33.651
Thank you!

494
00:41:34.669 --> 00:41:39.264
- Well?
- They were splendid. But as I said before...

495
00:41:39.265 --> 00:41:43.063
I have made my decision.

496
00:41:44.225 --> 00:41:47.535
I see.
You've made your decision.

497
00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:54.023
I don't need to speak out of school doctor,
but in the true spirit of democracy ...

498
00:41:54.023 --> 00:41:58.592
which our great wonderful country was
founded upon...

499
00:41:58.594 --> 00:42:01.795
I say, let the people vote.

500
00:42:01.796 --> 00:42:07.392
Let them choose.
One person, one vote, I say, let us vote!

501
00:42:07.393 --> 00:42:10.711
Let us vote.

502
00:42:10.712 --> 00:42:13.755
Let us vote.

503
00:42:13.756 --> 00:42:17.221
Please don't be a flasher granby...

504
00:42:17.222 --> 00:42:19.571
let them sing.

505
00:42:19.572 --> 00:42:22.180
Let us vote.

506
00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:27.601
You make a persuasive case, Mr Hawke.

507
00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:31.815
All right, here is what I'm going to do.

508
00:42:31.816 --> 00:42:36.402
This friday, each group will perform
one song in front of the student body.

509
00:42:36.914 --> 00:42:40.287
Whoever gets the most applause, well,
will represent the school.

510
00:42:40.288 --> 00:42:41.969
What?

511
00:42:42.716 --> 00:42:46.602
Thank you. We made it.

512
00:42:46.603 --> 00:42:49.319
Oh, it is on, like Donkey Kong!

513
00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:55.236
The Meerkats huddle together, at
the end of a dramatic day ...

514
00:42:55.237 --> 00:42:57.978
to reaffirm their family bond.

515
00:42:57.979 --> 00:43:02.052
The whiskers are going to have
to rely on each other more than ever.

516
00:43:02.053 --> 00:43:06.287
Guys, I'm so happy that Mrs Ortega
can rehearsal with us every day after school.

517
00:43:06.288 --> 00:43:10.602
- Wow! Every day?
- Stop right there, ok!

518
00:43:10.602 --> 00:43:13.847
We are the team, we need you.

519
00:43:13.848 --> 00:43:16.778
Would you relax? We are not going to lose.

520
00:43:16.779 --> 00:43:19.422
We'll talk about this in the morning.

521
00:43:19.423 --> 00:43:22.956
Not much to talk about.
I will see you at the rehearsal.

522
00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:27.648
- Stop huggin'.
- I am not huggin'.

523
00:43:27.649 --> 00:43:33.220
You might as well be really obstacles
in the face countryside because you are in fact huggin'.

524
00:43:33.222 --> 00:43:37.533
- I'm not.
- I saw, and saw...

525
00:43:37.533 --> 00:43:40.166
I think I will sleep in my own bed tonight.

526
00:43:40.167 --> 00:43:43.055
You know for me, I'm so glad I'm not a meerkat.

527
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.382
- Oh, really? And why is that?
- I would never hug with you!

528
00:44:00.542 --> 00:44:04.468
Toby, can I sleep with you?

529
00:44:07.573 --> 00:44:10.685
- What?
- Be kind to me.

530
00:44:10.686 --> 00:44:13.528
My brothers are fighting.

531
00:44:14.779 --> 00:44:18.877
What? Geeeee... ok.

532
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.350
Man, Dutch Oven!

533
00:44:32.352 --> 00:44:36.985
Not the Dutch Oven!
Anything but the Dutch Oven! I cant breath!

534
00:44:38.341 --> 00:44:41.520
It's to late! It burns! It burns!

535
00:45:04.602 --> 00:45:08.059
Now, let's see. What else am I in the mood for?

536
00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:11.635
How about a side order of friendly advice, courtesy of me?

537
00:45:11.637 --> 00:45:13.835
No, thanks.

538
00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:15.962
Grapes, please.

539
00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:23.024
Heh, heh. Excuse me. Ahem.
So, uh, well, I, I, I just wanted to warn you... about Ian.

540
00:45:23.024 --> 00:45:25.602
What?

541
00:45:25.603 --> 00:45:30.698
You should be grateful to him.
He did everything for you, Alvin, and you broke his heart.

542
00:45:30.698 --> 00:45:33.938
Hmm,really. How do I put this gently!

543
00:45:33.939 --> 00:45:36.594
He's the devil,
he doesn't have a heart,

544
00:45:36.595 --> 00:45:40.307
and one of the things he did for us
was put us in a cage!

545
00:45:40.308 --> 00:45:45.388
- Oh, Alvin, he would never do that.
- Yeah, well, you were there, I forgot...

546
00:45:45.389 --> 00:45:48.316
- You, you'd better watch out.
- I don't need any advice from you.

547
00:45:48.317 --> 00:45:51.675
-But...
-But, nothing, Alvin! Ian's taking us straight to the tooooooopppp!

548
00:45:55.633 --> 00:45:58.662
Right, straight to the top. I got it.

549
00:45:58.663 --> 00:46:01.930
Yeah, funny. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

550
00:46:06.822 --> 00:46:09.873
Hah, hah we are, so, going to destroy those Chipmunks!

551
00:46:09.874 --> 00:46:13.391
- I don't want to destroy them.
- Me neither. I just want to hang out with them.

552
00:46:13.392 --> 00:46:17.343
All right, look. If you feel that way ...

553
00:46:17.344 --> 00:46:20.846
- Maybe we should just withdraw from the contest.
- What?!

554
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:24.363
I'll put you all in Fedex package and mail you
back to whatever tree you came from.

555
00:46:24.364 --> 00:46:28.069
Sounds good? Ok then.
Take room from the top. Let's go!

556
00:46:31.501 --> 00:46:35.496
Wow, wow stop.
Short one in the green dress...

557
00:46:35.497 --> 00:46:37.297
- what's your name again?
- Eleanor.

558
00:46:37.297 --> 00:46:40.920
Yeah, look. I'm losin' you there, you know.
Have you always been that short?

559
00:46:40.922 --> 00:46:44.282
- I guess.
- You've got to work on that.

560
00:46:44.282 --> 00:46:47.512
Ok, all right. Let me try somethin' here.

561
00:46:47.514 --> 00:46:50.765
Brittany, here. Come up here.
No, you two stay back.

562
00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:54.801
A little further.

563
00:46:54.802 --> 00:46:57.243
Oh, yeah! Now that I like!

564
00:46:57.244 --> 00:47:01.067
It's not just because Brittany is more
than mega-ultra superstar than you guys.

565
00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:06.382
Good, good. Ok, you know what, let's get a
little more separation. Brittany, stay there.

566
00:47:06.382 --> 00:47:11.470
Get a little more separation from you guys.
Give her some room! Give her some room, guys.

567
00:47:11.504 --> 00:47:15.267
All right. Watch me now.

568
00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:18.923
One, two, three ... Watch me.
Watch me now.

569
00:47:28.932 --> 00:47:31.619
- Hello?
- Toby?

570
00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:34.833
What are you doing in the house?
Where is Aunt Jacky?

571
00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:39.772
Dave, hey Dave, what's happenin'?

572
00:47:41.118 --> 00:47:46.191
Aunt Jacky is in the hospital.

573
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:51.879
I am a little worried.
Who's watcin' the boys?

574
00:47:53.139 --> 00:47:55.482
I am.

575
00:47:56.342 --> 00:48:00.239
- So, Dave, how is Paris?
- Wait, are the boys behaving?

576
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.021
Absolutely. They've been just pitchy.

577
00:48:03.623 --> 00:48:07.396
- Toby, what's going on?
- Nothing. Don't even worry about it.

578
00:48:07.397 --> 00:48:10.786
You know, I know that you're not suppose to be stress down.

579
00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:14.365
-So I'm gonna go right now, but it's all good here.
Come home soon. Bye.
- Toby? Toby?

580
00:48:18.716 --> 00:48:22.607
Nurse, get me out of here!

581
00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:25.960
Help...

582
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:31.256
I don't mean to interrupt your game but I
saw you stand up to Ryan when he littered...

583
00:48:31.292 --> 00:48:33.232
- That's to guts.

584
00:48:33.233 --> 00:48:37.282
That's the kind of guy we are looking for.

585
00:48:37.283 --> 00:48:39.784
- How do you do, I am ...

586
00:48:39.785 --> 00:48:43.427
- And litter monitor Simon Seville.
- Litter monitor?

587
00:48:43.429 --> 00:48:46.017
Litter monitor,
it's a new position that we've created,

588
00:48:46.018 --> 00:48:49.506
to help raise awareness to the presssing problem
in our society.

589
00:48:49.507 --> 00:48:53.370
I agree 99% plus 1.

590
00:48:53.371 --> 00:48:55.601
You did the math.

591
00:48:55.602 --> 00:48:58.615
Simon, I know this is a lot to ask...

592
00:48:58.617 --> 00:49:04.672
We are lookin' for a take-charge guy who
take charge of this very rewarding position.

593
00:49:04.673 --> 00:49:07.450

596
00:49:16.995 --> 00:49:21.657
Hello, ladies.
You are probably unaware that you've thrown

I even wasn't aware that school even had
a litter monitor.

00:49:51.185 --> 00:49:53.908

Oh, you wanna play that game, do you?
Guess what, I can play that game all day long.

611
00:50:17.811 --> 00:50:19.959
It's a joke, dude.

612
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.560
Litter is no joking matter.

613
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.505
You're the joke.
We are messing with you.

614
00:50:24.506 --> 00:50:26.961
There is no such a thing as Litter monitor.

615
00:50:26.961 --> 00:50:29.430
What?
Big liar, huh!

616

00:51:53.744 --> 00:51:56.641

638
00:52:17.837 --> 00:52:21.455
Don't worry Theo, everything is gonna be fine.

639
00:52:21.456 --> 00:52:26.077
- Alvin, do not miss that Sing all.
- Don't worry, Simon.

640
00:52:26.078 --> 00:52:29.327
I'll be there. I can prove.

641
00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:32.699
Hey guys, thanks so much for helping out today.

642
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:37.511
"Toys for Tots" is a really cool organization.
So, everybody is gettin' cool points today.

643
00:52:39.706 --> 00:52:42.555
- What's goin' with Theodore?
- I have no idea.

644
00:52:48.184 --> 00:52:51.289
- Hey Eleanor, why don't you see if Theodore needs some help?
- Ok.

645
00:53:10.316 --> 00:53:15.199
- They don't look very comfortable.
- My shoes?

646
00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:20.125
- They are not.
- But Ian says that I need to work on being higher.

647
00:53:21.497 --> 00:53:24.875
Well... I think you look great just the way you are.

648
00:53:25.767 --> 00:53:29.158
You do?

649
00:53:37.405 --> 00:53:40.454
Hi, you've reached Dave Seville,
please leave a message.

650
00:53:40.455 --> 00:53:44.901
Hi, Toby.
This is Julie Ortega, we talked yesterday...

651
00:53:44.902 --> 00:53:49.488
we got a sort of it.
Anyway, the reason I'm calling,

652
00:53:49.489 --> 00:53:54.295
is that I am worried about Theodore,
he's been acting a little down lately.

653
00:53:55.588 --> 00:53:57.786
I hope you are going to the Sing all Friday.

654
00:53:57.787 --> 00:54:01.268
You know if this down go,
Theodore needs all the support he can get.

655
00:54:01.367 --> 00:54:08.528
So, I'll see you there.
I hope we get a chance to talk. Bye.

656
00:54:15.699 --> 00:54:18.853
<i>Ok, folks. Time to get behind your Warriors...<i>

657
00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:23.326
<i>They are listening Eagles down by five,
with only thirty seconds left on the game.<i>

658
00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:28.366
<i>- Time is running out for the ...
- ...He really needs to make a move here or...<i>

659
00:54:28.367 --> 00:54:31.535
<i>This game is over.<i>
- I know, put me in.

660
00:54:31.536 --> 00:54:34.096
Hey, put me in.

661
00:54:37.765 --> 00:54:40.681
- Time out, Time out.
<i>Time out Eagles<i>

662
00:54:40.683 --> 00:54:43.668
<i>Number 15 got nine seconds to make it to the game.<i>

663
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:52.876
All right boys, it's time for the big A.

664
00:54:52.877 --> 00:54:57.386
I'm going to crush them and burn them to pain.
The Alvinator is in the house.

665
00:54:57.387 --> 00:54:58.700
Are you sure about this?

666
00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.833
Four to ten say that we need to go
for the secret weapon.

667
00:55:00.933 --> 00:55:04.017
Chip is right.
He left decision to me.

668
00:55:04.019 --> 00:55:07.305
Time to make history, boys.

669
00:55:15.103 --> 00:55:18.657
I'm taking you down, Jennifer.

670
00:55:18.657 --> 00:55:21.434
You are the one going down, rat face.

671
00:55:21.434 --> 00:55:24.941
I'm going to crack you like an acorn
and eat you for dinner.

672
00:55:24.942 --> 00:55:27.909
With some fava beans and a nice chianti.

673
00:55:29.172 --> 00:55:33.073
Is this something about my father?

674
00:55:33.074 --> 00:55:36.374
One, two ...

675
00:55:45.135 --> 00:55:48.046
I'm comin'!

676
00:55:56.717 --> 00:56:01.020
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Don't hate the pain, hate the game.

677
00:56:01.021 --> 00:56:03.753
I love the hunt, man.

678
00:56:03.754 --> 00:56:07.557
<i>Final score: Eagles 15. The Warriors 14<i>

679
00:56:07.558 --> 00:56:12.589
What you think about that, sucker?

680
00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:15.990
- That's what I'm talking about.
- You're really muscle chipmunk.

681
00:56:15.992 --> 00:56:20.694
Give me a A, give me an O,
give me a W, give me an E, give me a M...

682
00:56:20.694 --> 00:56:23.592
How that spell...AWESOME.

683
00:56:23.593 --> 00:56:26.503
I am the king of the world.

684
00:56:27.781 --> 00:56:29.679
Party with Alvin.

685
00:56:29.679 --> 00:56:32.317
Everybody to the beach house.

686
00:56:32.318 --> 00:56:34.640
Let's do it.

687
00:56:41.044 --> 00:56:44.558
Look guys,
I just want you to know that I'm here for you.

688
00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:49.021
There is plenty of time.I'm gonna go find Alvin.
Everything is gonna work out.

689
00:56:49.544 --> 00:56:54.505
-Thank you, Toby.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Dr Rubin<i>

690
00:56:56.848 --> 00:56:59.002
<i>Thank you, students.Thank you.<i>

691
00:56:59.003 --> 00:57:02.194
Welcome to our exiciting "Sing all" Competition ...

692
00:57:02.195 --> 00:57:05.388
Between the Chipmunks
and the Chipettes.

693
00:57:09.461 --> 00:57:13.666
Remember students, there
are no winners or losers.

694
00:57:13.667 --> 00:57:17.168
Remind me to tell the Chipmunks that one,
when we blow up off the stage.

695
00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:22.153
...To our school, a chance to win 25 000 dollars
to save our music department.

696
00:57:22.154 --> 00:57:26.270
So, without further due,
I give you ... the Chipettes.

697
00:57:28.308 --> 00:57:31.553
This is it girls, can you believe it.

698
00:57:31.554 --> 00:57:34.886
Brittany, your time to shine baby.

699
00:57:34.887 --> 00:57:38.550
- Go up there and knock them dead.
- Yes sir, I can do it.

700
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:44.111
- You two I just wanna let you know, not to get in Brittany's way.
- Ah, ok.

701
00:58:30.541 --> 00:58:33.267
You like what you see,
call Ian Hawke ...

702
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:37.119
310-555-5309.

703
00:58:39.337 --> 00:58:43.318
Don't worry, Simon, Alvin will walk
through that door any minute now.
Alvin!

704
00:58:49.171 --> 00:58:52.044
I'm back.

705
00:59:01.707 --> 00:59:07.803
- Thank you so much. Thank you.
- Well done, ladies.

706
00:59:07.839 --> 00:59:13.499
And now, let teared for the group that
will rock you like a hurricane.

707
00:59:13.499 --> 00:59:17.349
At least that is what many of you
students have told me.

708
00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:20.799
Here they are...the Chipmunks.

709
00:59:22.226 --> 00:59:26.200
Hey, you know they say there is no "I" in
the word "team", and they are right.

710
00:59:26.201 --> 00:59:29.531
But,you know where is "IN" ?
Alvin.

711
00:59:31.376 --> 00:59:34.248
Such to be you.
Girls!

712
00:59:34.248 --> 00:59:37.116
Sadly, he's correct.

713
00:59:37.748 --> 00:59:42.478
- Did you find him?
- Guys, sorry, I serched the whole surroundings.

714
00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:45.041
And I don't know why, but
the team is not back yet.

715
00:59:45.042 --> 00:59:47.782
What should we do?

716
00:59:48.888 --> 00:59:51.761
I would ...

717
00:59:51.762 --> 00:59:56.090
I would ask someone...who's not me.

718
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.626
I know what we should do.

719
01:00:10.322 --> 01:00:13.105
Hi, everyone.

720
01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:19.440
Our brother, Alvin couldn't be here today.

721
01:00:20.649 --> 01:00:24.199
Thing is, we never performed without Alvin ..

722
01:00:24.299 --> 01:00:28.573
and we are not starting now.

723
01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:34.638
You can't have two little pigs,
you can't have only two musketeers so...

724
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:38.422
You know you can't have only two chipmunks.

725
01:00:39.423 --> 01:00:40.726
Thank you.

726
01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:53.852
I'll take you home.

727
01:01:05.674 --> 01:01:07.264
You hear that, girls?

728
01:01:07.265 --> 01:01:11.372
That...is the sound of success.

729
01:01:14.356 --> 01:01:17.783
I relize how devastated you...

730
01:01:17.784 --> 01:01:19.943
Chipmunks' funs must be...

731
01:01:22.777 --> 01:01:25.659
So I guess that means that the Chipettes...

732
01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.506
Come on girls, let's take a victory lap.

733
01:01:30.156 --> 01:01:32.183
Hey, come on guys, let's go.

734
01:01:32.184 --> 01:01:34.224
Britt, we have to.

735
01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:36.335
Let's go.

736
01:01:40.869 --> 01:01:42.815
Thank you.

737
01:01:51.722 --> 01:01:53.164
Life is good.

738
01:01:53.949 --> 01:01:56.097
Especially when you're not a loser.

739
01:01:58.003 --> 01:01:59.879
Hey guys? I'm here.

740
01:02:01.614 --> 01:02:02.683
Guys?

741
01:02:03.497 --> 01:02:05.328
Oh, great.

742
01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.033
They are gone, Alvin.

743
01:02:07.855 --> 01:02:11.438
- They never gonna forgive me.
- You know ... Alvin...

744
01:02:11.439 --> 01:02:15.508
Ian was right.
You don't care about anyone except yourself.

745
01:02:21.273 --> 01:02:25.353
And oh, by the way,
I never wanna to win this way.

746
01:02:42.803 --> 01:02:45.151
Simon, are you awake?

747
01:03:16.268 --> 01:03:18.206
Theodore, I don't blame you for being mad.

748
01:03:20.949 --> 01:03:23.241
I ran away from home?

749
01:03:23.242 --> 01:03:26.470
Don't look for me in the Zoo,
because I'm not there.

750
01:03:26.471 --> 01:03:28.491
Oh, no Theodore ...

751
01:03:34.612 --> 01:03:36.193
Hello?

752
01:03:37.112 --> 01:03:39.707
Meerkat family?

753
01:03:46.353 --> 01:03:47.858
Is anyone home?

754
01:03:48.647 --> 01:03:52.203
My name is Theodore, I like to in your family.

755
01:03:59.652 --> 01:04:01.404
Maybe they are hidin'.

756
01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.769
Don't be afraid.

757
01:04:08.469 --> 01:04:12.539
You are not a meerkat!

758
01:04:13.106 --> 01:04:16.004
Toby, you take the lions,
tigers and the bears ...

759
01:04:16.005 --> 01:04:18.167
Simon and I will take the butterfly room.

760
01:04:19.001 --> 01:04:20.873
Nice eagle.

761
01:04:22.481 --> 01:04:24.260
Don't move Theodore.

762
01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:26.590
No problem there.

763
01:04:26.592 --> 01:04:29.650
Hang in there, hang in little guy.
We'll get you out of here.

764
01:04:32.124 --> 01:04:35.454
Ok, we need a plan.
And we need carefuly executed plan.

765
01:04:36.116 --> 01:04:39.097
Or you can just ride in there like a maniac.

766
01:04:40.709 --> 01:04:41.935
Theo, watch out.

767
01:04:41.936 --> 01:04:44.331
Hi, I'm Theodore ...

768
01:04:46.698 --> 01:04:49.320
Hey birdy, over here, are you hungry?
Catch this "A"?

769
01:04:49.322 --> 01:04:51.795
That's for appetizer.

770
01:04:54.675 --> 01:04:57.480
Let's all just relax, and
we talk this out, ok!

771
01:04:58.646 --> 01:05:03.838
Look, I guess why you want Theodore, I do,

772
01:05:03.937 --> 01:05:07.435
but I'm sorry, I can't let that happen.

773
01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.917
He's my brother.

774
01:05:09.543 --> 01:05:14.914
Not let him know that, because
I've been such a big jerk lately.

775
01:05:17.712 --> 01:05:21.062
If anyone deserves to be eaten, it's me.

776
01:05:22.457 --> 01:05:23.541
Not really.

777
01:05:23.564 --> 01:05:26.682
I got you, Alvin.

778
01:05:33.418 --> 01:05:34.931
Watch to the eagle.

779
01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:39.127
The only more enemy is a piggy elephant.
Luckily I speak a little "elephant".

780
01:05:44.236 --> 01:05:45.749
I think it's working.

781
01:05:55.837 --> 01:05:57.591
Guys, that was huge.

782
01:05:58.189 --> 01:06:03.078
He's right. Now we are one for all
and three for one?

783
01:06:04.422 --> 01:06:06.418
Come on, Simon, hug it out.

784
01:06:07.274 --> 01:06:09.248
You know I'm sorry, Sy.

785
01:06:12.279 --> 01:06:14.131
Sy, don't make me up to kiss you because
I'll do it.

786
01:06:14.131 --> 01:06:16.669
I don't care.

787
01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:21.195
Here come the lips!
Makeout train is leaving the station.

788
01:06:24.059 --> 01:06:26.234
I think after that, I'll take that hug.

789
01:06:36.206 --> 01:06:38.626
Justine, call Ian Hawke.

790
01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:42.257
310-555-5309.

791
01:06:42.258 --> 01:06:45.254
Morris, get me that Ian Hawke
on the phone.

792
01:06:48.459 --> 01:06:51.205
There you are.

793
01:06:51.206 --> 01:06:53.257
My sweet little money makers.

794
01:06:54.138 --> 01:06:58.453
Do you remember when I told you
that I would make you all big stars?

795
01:07:00.251 --> 01:07:03.319
Well, guess who's opening up for Britney Spears
at Staples Center tonight?

796
01:07:05.013 --> 01:07:06.803
Am I dreamin'? oh, my gosh!

797
01:07:06.804 --> 01:07:09.722
Oh, wait, we can't.
We'll miss the school concert!

798
01:07:10.179 --> 01:07:13.207
That's correct.
You will miss the school contest.

799
01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:15.688
You are so smart, I can't never get
anything passed by you.

800
01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:23.213
It was never about that stupid school contest,
it was always about making Brittany a star.

801
01:07:23.214 --> 01:07:25.180
That's what you wanted, right?

802
01:07:27.398 --> 01:07:30.653
- well...yes.
- Tonight is your big chance.

803
01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:32.844
It's all about you, Brittany.

804
01:07:32.845 --> 01:07:35.331
But what about Jeanette and Eleanor?

805
01:07:35.331 --> 01:07:38.503
They can sing backups,
I got them some staff too.

806
01:07:39.935 --> 01:07:45.680
- We are her sisters.
- We either sing together or not at all!

807
01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:49.610
Ok, fine.
All I ever needed is the B-girl.

808
01:07:52.011 --> 01:07:54.110
Ian, I won't do it without them.

809
01:07:56.962 --> 01:07:59.670
Ok, fine, fine. Let's move on to Plan B.

810
01:07:59.671 --> 01:08:02.669
Ok, who likes barbecue?

811
01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:09.186
Because I know this awesome little barbecue restaurant in the valley,
that makes the best roasted chipmunks.

812
01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:15.453
Real tasty.
Unless of course, you wanna sing?

813
01:08:23.548 --> 01:08:28.729
Welcome to West Eastman, and thank you
for supporting music in our schools.

814
01:08:28.851 --> 01:08:34.353
Now remember,the group you pick tonight,
will win 25000 dollars for their school.

815
01:08:35.803 --> 01:08:39.788
Now there's got a lot of acts, and we have to
trow heat off by nine-thirdy so ..

816
01:08:39.790 --> 01:08:46.988
without no further due, representing Orange girl
put your hands together for...Lou Rosarro.

817
01:09:13.145 --> 01:09:16.906
We meet again.
You wanna a piece of it?

818
01:09:17.006 --> 01:09:18.851
Eagle.

819
01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:23.792
Ian Hawke?

820
01:09:23.793 --> 01:09:25.962
I'll take that.

821
01:09:26.208 --> 01:09:30.121
I didn't realise that you are runnin' a low life.

822
01:09:30.122 --> 01:09:35.015
- Alvin, - Brittany?
- Aren't you guys still interest?

823
01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:37.758
I'm not gonna be able to perform tonight.

824
01:09:37.759 --> 01:09:40.778
What about the music department?
The whole school is counting on you.

825
01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:44.281
I know, I know.
I had to listen to you about Ian.

826
01:09:44.282 --> 01:09:45.365
Don't tell me...

827
01:09:45.367 --> 01:09:48.219
Yes, he locked us in a cage.

828
01:09:48.924 --> 01:09:53.741
This is this the biggest you have?
I have licence to call and asked for the biggest thing,
that's not the biggest what you got.

829
01:09:53.743 --> 01:09:55.658
I will go and talk to Dr Rubin.

830
01:09:56.766 --> 01:09:59.085
- Brittany?
- Alvin, don't move.

831
01:09:59.086 --> 01:10:01.752
You got it.
Brittany, I'm comin' to get you.

832
01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:04.519
Simon, how do you know to hit a lock?

833
01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.461
Roger that.

834
01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:08.314
I need to get to those girls.
Fast.

835
01:10:08.349 --> 01:10:10.159
I know how.

836
01:10:24.097 --> 01:10:28.063
The third number is notoriously the hardest to crack ...

837
01:10:28.065 --> 01:10:30.605
I'm assuming that provide number that we can't assume...

838
01:10:30.989 --> 01:10:34.682
The first two numbers are one.
I got to go with one.

839
01:10:34.717 --> 01:10:35.962
It opened.

840
01:10:36.062 --> 01:10:37.716
- All right,  girls ...
- Ian is coming.

841
01:10:37.717 --> 01:10:39.508
Put the phone back, hurry!

842
01:10:39.509 --> 01:10:40.968
Get ready to be fabulous.

843
01:10:40.969 --> 01:10:42.502
We are ready.

844
01:10:42.503 --> 01:10:47.327
Yeah, you're better be.
Because tonight's performance it's gonna put me back on the top.

845
01:10:55.687 --> 01:10:58.160
And now please welcome...Cherisse.

846
01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:19.765
Driver man, take me to the Arena.
The VIP entrance.

847
01:11:19.765 --> 01:11:24.109
Tout de suite.
A little moonroofs actions.

848
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:28.022
Moonroofs are go, moonroofs, roofs, roofs...

849
01:11:28.023 --> 01:11:30.271
Champagne.

850
01:11:30.273 --> 01:11:32.919
If you don't mind ...
If I do...

851
01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:38.642
You know why I don't mind if I do?
Because tonight we've got to toast ...

852
01:11:38.643 --> 01:11:43.431
To a very special someone, named me.

853
01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:47.567
They said I couldn't do it,
they said I never bounce back.

854
01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.807
Guess what?
Time to kiss my ass.

855
01:11:54.425 --> 01:11:59.815
A toast! To the ladies who gonna make the world forget
about the Chipmu...

856
01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:09.220
No, no, no, no! What are doin'? Alvin.

857
01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:12.810
Hi Ian! Good to see you.You look alright!

858
01:12:15.996 --> 01:12:17.830
No, no! I signed a contract.

859
01:12:17.832 --> 01:12:21.258
- Jump, Jeanette. -Wait!
- I'm not really good...

860
01:12:22.128 --> 01:12:23.938
I bet it you don't perform.

861
01:12:23.939 --> 01:12:25.867
- Gas, Alvin.
- You got it!

862
01:12:26.573 --> 01:12:29.860
Hey, Ian! In the words of McDonald, you're fired!

863
01:12:43.442 --> 01:12:47.015
- Hey guys, any sayin' about Alvin yet?
- No Alvin and no Chipettes.

864
01:12:47.016 --> 01:12:51.150
Just Dr Rubin and the entire school are counting on us.

865
01:12:53.632 --> 01:13:00.074
Well, you know...you know don't worry
everything will work out...ish.

866
01:13:07.655 --> 01:13:09.328
- Faster Alvin!
- Don't worry...

867
01:13:09.329 --> 01:13:12.113
I'm gonna get a real help from my friend, stay there.

868
01:13:13.228 --> 01:13:15.426
Roger that Alvin.

869
01:13:15.427 --> 01:13:17.317
Just like I'm back on the racetrack.

870
01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.106
Where you going?
What are you doing?

871
01:13:23.181 --> 01:13:27.158
Wait 'til I tell everybody back home that
I've saved Alvin Seville.

872
01:13:27.159 --> 01:13:29.450
I think I owe you an apology about Ian.

873
01:13:29.451 --> 01:13:32.272
Stick with me Britt.
I'll never stay alive.

874
01:13:33.735 --> 01:13:36.052
Oh yeah , I'll never got to do that.

875
01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:42.243
I got to say, he's definitely persistant.

876
01:13:45.533 --> 01:13:47.971
- We got to lose him.
- Hang on.

877
01:13:49.685 --> 01:13:52.367
I got a plan, jump on a count of three!

878
01:13:52.451 --> 01:13:54.521
Three.

879
01:13:54.876 --> 01:13:58.228
- Oh, that's it.
- I didn't like heights.

880
01:13:58.328 --> 01:14:01.312
- Keep your tight Jeanette.
- Bring my girls right to me.

881
01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:04.775
- We need a  remote.
- Guys, I know what to do.

882
01:14:04.776 --> 01:14:06.708
Hats off to Ian.

883
01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.033
The remote.

884
01:14:16.485 --> 01:14:18.127
I can't reach it.

885
01:14:18.128 --> 01:14:20.286
I'm doing it.
Hold my ankles.

886
01:14:24.408 --> 01:14:26.206
I got it.

887
01:14:26.734 --> 01:14:28.719
I got it?

888
01:14:29.855 --> 01:14:32.428
- Well done, Jen.
- Top work, Jeanette.

889
01:14:33.793 --> 01:14:37.504
Hey Ian, you were wrong.
I don't need these.

890
01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:47.897
- Bye bye.
- Adios, Ian.

891
01:14:49.014 --> 01:14:51.820
And now, for our final act of the night...

892
01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:56.780
And, listen we have last second change to the line up,
but we don't think you gonna be to disapointed.

893
01:14:56.781 --> 01:15:01.063
Representing West Eastman it's...the Chipmunks.

894
01:15:05.439 --> 01:15:07.532
We may have to go up there , Theodore.

895
01:15:15.130 --> 01:15:17.552
If there are no Chipmunks
we gonna have to move on.

896
01:15:21.498 --> 01:15:23.681
I don't wanna be good again.

897
01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.318
I'm sorry, but we have to move on.

898
01:15:34.534 --> 01:15:37.226
I'm not a Chipmunk, as you can see.

899
01:15:44.922 --> 01:15:47.647
Where is the music you loser?
Where is the music? Music?!

900
01:15:52.026 --> 01:15:54.976
Ok, I got to song.

901
01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:36.992
Well, that...was huge.

903
01:16:44.923 --> 01:16:47.931
The Chipmunks are in the building.

904
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:51.545
