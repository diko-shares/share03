00:01:20.324 --> 00:01:21.658
Doc!

2
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.719
Doc, Doc, Doc!

3
00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:26.950
- Doc!
- What?

4
00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:28.156
Doc!

5
00:02:29.476 --> 00:02:30.498
Okay, relax, Doc.

6
00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:31.850
It's me. It's me!
It's Marty.

7
00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.031
No, it can't be.

8
00:02:33.062 --> 00:02:34.539
I just sent you back
to the future.

9
00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:36.133
No, I know.
You did send me back...

10
00:02:36.158 --> 00:02:37.664
to the future,
but I'm back.

11
00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:39.844
I'm back from the future.

12
00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:45.455
Great Scott!

13
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.467
<i>Say kids, what time is it?</i>

14
00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:05.037
<i>Howdy Doody time!</i>

15
00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:06.754
<i>♪ It's Howdy ♪</i>

16
00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.043
- Great Scott!
- <i>♪ Doody Time ♪</i>

17
00:05:09.098 --> 00:05:12.129
<i>♪ It's Howdy Doody Time ♪</i>

18
00:05:12.154 --> 00:05:14.944
<i>♪ Bob Smith and Howdy too ♪</i>

19
00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:18.000
<i>♪ Say Howdy Do to you ♪</i>

20
00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:20.061
Howdy Doody time?

21
00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:26.352
Date: Sunday,

22
00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:29.392
November 13, 1955.
7:01 a.m.

23
00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:32.907
Last night's time travel experiment
was apparently a complete success.

24
00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:35.696
Lightning struck the clock
tower at precisely 10:04 p.m.,

25
00:05:35.727 --> 00:05:38.723
sending the necessary 1.21
gigawatts into the time vehicle,

26
00:05:38.748 --> 00:05:40.935
which vanished in
a brilliant flash of light...

27
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.258
leaving a pair of fire trails behind.

28
00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.408
I, therefore, assume...

29
00:05:44.448 --> 00:05:46.563
that Marty and the time vehicle
were transported forward...

30
00:05:46.588 --> 00:05:49.314
through time into the year 1985.

31
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:50.463
After that,

32
00:05:50.488 --> 00:05:51.846
uh, after that,

33
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:53.456
I can't recall what happened.

34
00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:56.322
In fact, I don't even
remember how I got home.

35
00:05:56.377 --> 00:05:58.299
Perhaps the gigawatt discharge,

36
00:05:58.338 --> 00:06:00.149
coupled with the temporal
displacement field,

37
00:06:00.174 --> 00:06:01.657
generated by the time vehicle,

38
00:06:01.682 --> 00:06:03.648
caused a disruption
of my own brain waves,

39
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:06.465
resulting in a condition
of momentary amnesia.

40
00:06:06.535 --> 00:06:08.152
Indeed, I now recall
that moments...

41
00:06:08.177 --> 00:06:11.082
after the time vehicle
disappeared into the future.

42
00:06:11.113 --> 00:06:13.340
Oh, I saw a vision of Marty saying,

43
00:06:13.365 --> 00:06:15.379
he had come back
from the future.

44
00:06:15.404 --> 00:06:16.408
Hey, Doc!

45
00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:17.768
Undoubtedly,
this was some sort of...

46
00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:18.818
- Doc.
- residual imagery.

47
00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:26.576
Doc, calm down, okay.

48
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:28.225
Just calm down.
It's me, it's Marty.

49
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.561
No, it can't be you!

50
00:06:29.586 --> 00:06:32.029
- I sent you back to the future!
- That's right, Doc, that's right.

51
00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:34.108
But I came back again.
I came back from the future.

52
00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:35.161
Don't you remember last night?

53
00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.389
You fainted.
I brought you home.

54
00:06:36.414 --> 00:06:37.834
This can't be happening!

55
00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:38.976
You can't be here!

56
00:06:39.001 --> 00:06:40.350
It doesn't make sense
for you to be here!

57
00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.537
I refuse to even believe
that you are here!

58
00:06:42.562 --> 00:06:44.564
Doc, I am here,
and it does make sense.

59
00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:47.162
Look, I came back
to 1955 again with you,

60
00:06:47.193 --> 00:06:48.525
the you from 1985,

61
00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:50.049
'cause we had to get
a book from Biff!

62
00:06:50.074 --> 00:06:51.225
So once I got the book back,

63
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.955
you, that is the you from 1985,

64
00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.752
were in the DeLorean,
and it got struck by lightning,

65
00:06:54.777 --> 00:06:56.947
and you got sent back to 1885!

66
00:06:56.998 --> 00:06:58.647
1885?

67
00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:03.557
It's a very interesting story,
future boy.

68
00:07:03.603 --> 00:07:06.135
But, there's just one little thing
that doesn't make sense.

69
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.705
If the me of the future
is now in the past,

70
00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:11.221
how could you possibly
know about it?

71
00:07:11.283 --> 00:07:12.810
You sent me a letter.

72
00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:13.842
"Dear Marty,

73
00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:15.154
"If my calculations are correct,

74
00:07:15.179 --> 00:07:17.176
"you'll receive this letter
immediately after you saw...

75
00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:19.217
"the DeLorean struck by lightning.

76
00:07:19.411 --> 00:07:22.246
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

77
00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:26.291
"I've been living happily these past
eight months in the year 1885.

78
00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:28.055
"The lightning bolt
that hit the DeLorean...

79
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.299
"caused a gigawatt overload...

80
00:07:29.324 --> 00:07:30.978
"which scrambled the time circuits,

81
00:07:31.018 --> 00:07:32.682
"activated the Flux Capacitor,

82
00:07:32.707 --> 00:07:35.549
"and sent me back to 1885.

83
00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:37.541
"The overload shorted out
the time circuits...

84
00:07:37.566 --> 00:07:39.478
"and destroyed the flying circuits.

85
00:07:39.503 --> 00:07:42.177
"Unfortunately,
the car will never fly again."

86
00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:43.635
It actually flew?

87
00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:46.900
Yeah, we had a hover conversion
done in the early 21st century.

88
00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.799
Incredible!

89
00:07:48.908 --> 00:07:51.346
"I set myself up as a blacksmith,

90
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.394
"as a front while I attempted to repair
the damage to the time circuits.

91
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.487
"Unfortunately, this proved impossible,

92
00:07:57.512 --> 00:08:02.277
"because suitable replacement parts
will not be invented until 1947.

93
00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:04.051
"However, I've gotten quite adept...

94
00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:07.598
"at shoeing horses
and fixing wagons."

95
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.600
1885.

96
00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:11.638
Amazing!

97
00:08:11.663 --> 00:08:15.067
I actually end up as
a blacksmith in the Old West.

98
00:08:15.153 --> 00:08:16.572
Pretty heavy, huh?

99
00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:19.736
"I have buried the DeLorean
in the abandoned Delgado Mine,

100
00:08:19.768 --> 00:08:21.939
"adjacent to the old
Boot Hill Cemetery...

101
00:08:21.964 --> 00:08:24.197
"as shown on the enclosed map.

102
00:08:24.314 --> 00:08:26.057
"Hopefully, it should
remain undisturbed...

103
00:08:26.082 --> 00:08:30.221
"and preserved until
you uncover it in 1955.

104
00:08:30.654 --> 00:08:31.846
"Inside,

105
00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:34.322
"you will find repair instructions.

106
00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:36.830
"My 1955 counterpart..."

107
00:08:36.854 --> 00:08:38.025
That's me.

108
00:08:38.065 --> 00:08:39.666
"should have no problem repairing it,

109
00:08:39.693 --> 00:08:42.182
"so that, you can drive
it back to the future.

110
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:46.205
"Once you have returned to 1985,
destroy the time machine."

111
00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:47.705
Destroy it?

112
00:08:47.814 --> 00:08:50.899
Yeah, well,
it's a long story, Doc.

113
00:08:51.045 --> 00:08:52.205
"Do not,

114
00:08:52.245 --> 00:08:56.330
"I repeat, do not attempt
to come back here to get me.

115
00:08:56.492 --> 00:08:59.150
"I am perfectly happy
living in the fresh air...

116
00:08:59.206 --> 00:09:00.822
"and wide-open spaces.

117
00:09:00.869 --> 00:09:03.385
"And I fear that
unnecessary time travel...

118
00:09:03.416 --> 00:09:07.158
"only risks further disruption
of the space-time continuum.

119
00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:09.072
"And please, take care of...

120
00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:11.182
"Einstein for me."

121
00:09:12.127 --> 00:09:13.439
Einstein?

122
00:09:13.479 --> 00:09:14.682
He's your dog, Doc.

123
00:09:14.721 --> 00:09:18.275
Einstein is what
you call your dog in 1985.

124
00:09:20.619 --> 00:09:22.824
"I know you will
give him a good home.

125
00:09:22.869 --> 00:09:24.557
"Remember to walk him
twice a day,

126
00:09:24.582 --> 00:09:26.799
"and that he only likes
canned dog food.

127
00:09:26.853 --> 00:09:27.893
"These are my wishes.

128
00:09:27.918 --> 00:09:30.143
"Please, respect them
and follow them.

129
00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:31.525
"And so, Marty,

130
00:09:31.581 --> 00:09:34.518
"I now say farewell
and wish you Godspeed.

131
00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:37.299
"You've been a good, kind,
and loyal friend to me.

132
00:09:37.366 --> 00:09:39.877
"And you made a real
difference in my life.

133
00:09:40.072 --> 00:09:42.439
"I will always treasure
our relationship

134
00:09:42.486 --> 00:09:44.630
"and think on you
with fond memories,

135
00:09:44.682 --> 00:09:48.314
"warm feelings, and
a special place in my heart.

136
00:09:49.504 --> 00:09:51.098
"Your friend in time,

137
00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:53.380
"Doc Emmett L. Brown.

138
00:09:53.418 --> 00:09:56.966
"September 1st, 1885."

139
00:09:58.036 --> 00:09:59.544
I never knew
I could write anything...

140
00:09:59.569 --> 00:10:00.645
- so touching.
- I know, I know, Doc.

141
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.997
It's beautiful.

142
00:10:04.721 --> 00:10:06.706
It's all right, Copernicus.

143
00:10:06.737 --> 00:10:08.112
Everything is gonna be fine.

144
00:10:08.137 --> 00:10:09.331
I'm sorry, Doc.

145
00:10:09.356 --> 00:10:11.034
It's all my fault
you're stuck back there.

146
00:10:11.059 --> 00:10:12.721
I never should've
let Biff get to me.

147
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.721
Well, plenty worse places
to be than the Old West.

148
00:10:15.815 --> 00:10:17.378
I could have ended up
in the Dark Ages.

149
00:10:17.403 --> 00:10:19.159
They probably would have
burned me at the stake...

150
00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:21.035
as a heretic or something.

151
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.604
Let's look at the map.

152
00:10:22.635 --> 00:10:23.838
All right, according to this,

153
00:10:23.873 --> 00:10:26.995
the time vehicle is sealed off
in a side tunnel.

154
00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:29.987
We may have to blast.

155
00:10:42.247 --> 00:10:43.732
Whoa!

156
00:10:44.319 --> 00:10:46.601
I think you woke up
the dead with that blast.

157
00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:47.700
Take this camera.

158
00:10:47.725 --> 00:10:50.233
I want to document everything.

159
00:10:51.647 --> 00:10:53.334
This reminds me of the time...

160
00:10:53.359 --> 00:10:55.529
I attempted to reach
the center of the Earth.

161
00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:58.178
I'd been reading
my favorite author, Jules Verne.

162
00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:00.193
I spent weeks preparing
that expedition.

163
00:11:00.227 --> 00:11:01.834
I didn't even get this far.

164
00:11:01.859 --> 00:11:04.428
Of course,
I was only 12 at the time.

165
00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:05.646
You know,

166
00:11:05.686 --> 00:11:07.678
it was the writings of Jules Verne...

167
00:11:07.728 --> 00:11:10.225
that had a profound effect on my life.

168
00:11:10.342 --> 00:11:11.975
It was when I was 11
that I first read...

169
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.217
Twenty Thousand Leagues
Under the Sea.

170
00:11:14.253 --> 00:11:15.779
It was then that I realized...

171
00:11:15.813 --> 00:11:18.998
that I must devote my life to science.

172
00:11:19.343 --> 00:11:20.678
Doc, check it out.

173
00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:22.225
Look at this.

174
00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:26.990
My initials!

175
00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:29.435
Just like in Journey to
the Center of the Earth.

176
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.475
That means the time machine
must be right through this wall.

177
00:11:53.766 --> 00:11:59.118
Oh, it's been buried in here for
70 years, 2 months, and 13 days.

178
00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:00.594
Astounding!

179
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:01.868
"As you see,

180
00:12:01.893 --> 00:12:03.289
"the lightning bolt shorted out...

181
00:12:03.337 --> 00:12:06.642
"the time circuit control microchip.

182
00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:09.875
"The attached s..."

183
00:12:09.985 --> 00:12:11.102
Schematic.

184
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:12.563
"Schematic, schematic...

185
00:12:12.618 --> 00:12:15.360
"diagram will allow you
to build a replacement unit...

186
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.985
"with 1955 components,

187
00:12:17.009 --> 00:12:19.688
"thus, restoring the time machine
to perfect working order."

188
00:12:19.725 --> 00:12:22.180
Unbelievable that
this little piece of junk...

189
00:12:22.205 --> 00:12:24.422
could be such a big problem.

190
00:12:26.748 --> 00:12:28.309
No wonder this circuit failed.

191
00:12:28.336 --> 00:12:30.637
It says, "Made in Japan."

192
00:12:31.432 --> 00:12:33.035
What do you mean, Doc?

193
00:12:33.075 --> 00:12:35.824
All the best stuff is made in Japan.

194
00:12:37.021 --> 00:12:38.410
Unbelievable!

195
00:12:44.516 --> 00:12:45.731
You know,

196
00:12:45.841 --> 00:12:46.942
when I was a kid,

197
00:12:47.005 --> 00:12:49.810
I always wanted to be a cowboy.

198
00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:52.692
And now, knowing I'm gonna
spend my future in the past,

199
00:12:52.756 --> 00:12:56.505
it sounds like a wonderful way
to spend my retirement years.

200
00:12:56.682 --> 00:12:58.073
It just occurred to me, Marty.

201
00:12:58.098 --> 00:12:59.706
Since I end up in 1885,

202
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:01.761
perhaps, I'm now
in the history books.

203
00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:03.346
I wonder.

204
00:13:03.709 --> 00:13:05.706
Could I go to the library
and look myself up...

205
00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:07.799
in the old newspaper archives?

206
00:13:07.912 --> 00:13:09.042
I don't know, Doc.

207
00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:10.370
You're the one
that's always saying,

208
00:13:10.395 --> 00:13:12.471
you know, it's not good to know
too much about your own destiny.

209
00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:14.003
You're right, Marty.

210
00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:15.925
I know too much already.

211
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.604
Better that I not attempt
to uncover the circumstances...

212
00:13:18.629 --> 00:13:20.643
of my own future.

213
00:13:21.488 --> 00:13:22.951
Copernicus!

214
00:13:23.107 --> 00:13:24.756
Come on, boy!

215
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:25.982
I'll get him, Doc.

216
00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:27.412
Copernicus!

217
00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:30.740
Copernicus, come on.
Let's go home, boy.

218
00:13:32.086 --> 00:13:33.913
What's wrong?

219
00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:36.734
What's wrong, Copernicus?
Come on.

220
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:39.249
Come on, let's go home.
Come on.

221
00:13:39.274 --> 00:13:40.828
Come on.

222
00:13:43.872 --> 00:13:45.051
Doc!

223
00:13:45.098 --> 00:13:46.403
Doc!

224
00:13:46.428 --> 00:13:48.621
Come here!
Quick!

225
00:13:49.953 --> 00:13:51.348
What's wrong, Marty?

226
00:13:51.387 --> 00:13:53.598
You look like you've seen a ghost.

227
00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:56.067
You're not far off, Doc.

228
00:13:59.784 --> 00:14:01.743
Great Scott!

229
00:14:02.237 --> 00:14:03.549
Check this out.

230
00:14:03.605 --> 00:14:06.721
"Died September 7th, 1885."

231
00:14:06.746 --> 00:14:08.628
That's one week after
you wrote the letter!

232
00:14:08.656 --> 00:14:12.253
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara."

233
00:14:12.378 --> 00:14:13.674
Who the hell is Clara?

234
00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:15.806
Marty, please,
don't stand there!

235
00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.659
Oh! Right. Sorry.

236
00:14:17.717 --> 00:14:19.737
I gotta get another picture.

237
00:14:20.635 --> 00:14:22.010
"Shot in the back...

238
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.550
"by Buford Tannen...

239
00:14:23.589 --> 00:14:25.323
"over a matter of 80 dollars"?

240
00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:28.018
What kind of a future do you call that?

241
00:14:28.746 --> 00:14:31.316
"Buford Tannen was
a notorious gunman...

242
00:14:31.341 --> 00:14:32.714
"whose short temper...

243
00:14:32.762 --> 00:14:34.238
"and a tendency to drool...

244
00:14:34.263 --> 00:14:36.153
"earned him the nickname: Mad Dog.

245
00:14:36.178 --> 00:14:39.748
"He was quick on the trigger and
bragged that he had killed 12 men...

246
00:14:39.805 --> 00:14:41.639
"not including Indians or Chinamen."

247
00:14:41.673 --> 00:14:43.084
Does it mention me?

248
00:14:43.109 --> 00:14:44.632
- Am I one of the 12?
- Just a minute.

249
00:14:44.666 --> 00:14:46.529
"However this claim
cannot be substantiated,

250
00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:48.209
"since precise records were not kept...

251
00:14:48.248 --> 00:14:50.381
"after Tannen shot
a newspaper editor...

252
00:14:50.412 --> 00:14:52.873
"who printed an unfavorable
story about him in 1884."

253
00:14:52.898 --> 00:14:54.295
That's why we can't find anything.

254
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.506
Look.

255
00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.350
William McFly and family.

256
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:59.623
Your relatives?

257
00:14:59.652 --> 00:15:02.107
My great-grandfather's name
was William.

258
00:15:02.271 --> 00:15:03.686
That's him.

259
00:15:03.811 --> 00:15:05.725
Good-looking guy.

260
00:15:06.543 --> 00:15:07.998
McFlys,

261
00:15:08.053 --> 00:15:09.076
but no Browns.

262
00:15:09.101 --> 00:15:10.264
Maybe, it was a mistake, Doc.

263
00:15:10.289 --> 00:15:11.536
Maybe, that grave wasn't yours.

264
00:15:11.561 --> 00:15:13.701
There could've been another
Emmett Brown back in 1885.

265
00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:14.771
- No.
- Did you have...

266
00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:15.989
any relatives here back then?

267
00:15:16.014 --> 00:15:18.170
The Browns didn't come
to Hill Valley until 1908.

268
00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:20.061
And then,
they were the von Brauns.

269
00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.451
My father changed our name
during the First World War.

270
00:15:22.482 --> 00:15:24.053
Doc, look.

271
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.303
Great Scott!

272
00:15:27.334 --> 00:15:28.904
It's me.

273
00:15:28.973 --> 00:15:30.365
Then it is true.

274
00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:31.764
All of it.

275
00:15:31.857 --> 00:15:33.795
It is me who goes back there...

276
00:15:33.827 --> 00:15:35.381
and gets shot.

277
00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:37.654
It's not gonna happen, Doc.

278
00:15:37.917 --> 00:15:39.787
After you fix the time circuits...

279
00:15:39.812 --> 00:15:41.176
and put new tires on the DeLorean,

280
00:15:41.226 --> 00:15:42.982
I'm going back to 1885,

281
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.311
and I'm bringing you home.

282
00:15:56.195 --> 00:15:57.958
The clothes fit?

283
00:15:58.087 --> 00:16:00.308
Yeah, everything,
except the boots, Doc.

284
00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:01.582
They're kind of tight.

285
00:16:01.606 --> 00:16:04.082
I don't know. Are you sure
this stuff is authentic?

286
00:16:04.112 --> 00:16:05.503
Of course.

287
00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:07.972
Haven't you ever seen a Western?

288
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:10.215
Yeah, I have, Doc.

289
00:16:10.521 --> 00:16:13.363
And Clint Eastwood never
wore anything like this.

290
00:16:14.638 --> 00:16:16.130
Clint who?

291
00:16:16.271 --> 00:16:17.279
That's right.

292
00:16:17.304 --> 00:16:18.490
You haven't heard of him yet.

293
00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:20.380
Marty, you have to wear the boots.

294
00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:23.107
You can't wear those
futuristic things back in 1885.

295
00:16:23.146 --> 00:16:25.230
You shouldn't even be
wearing them here in 1955.

296
00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:26.574
All right, Doc. Look,
as soon as I get there,

297
00:16:26.599 --> 00:16:28.207
- I'll put them on. I promise.
- Okay.

298
00:16:28.232 --> 00:16:29.357
I think we're about ready.

299
00:16:29.382 --> 00:16:30.768
I put gas in the tank.

300
00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.310
Your future clothes are packed.

301
00:16:32.357 --> 00:16:33.490
Just in case,

302
00:16:33.515 --> 00:16:36.279
fresh batteries
for your walkie-talkies.

303
00:16:36.323 --> 00:16:37.331
Oh.

304
00:16:37.362 --> 00:16:39.049
What about that floating device?

305
00:16:39.095 --> 00:16:41.166
Hoverboard. All right.

306
00:16:42.994 --> 00:16:44.477
You know, Doc,
it's gonna be a hell...

307
00:16:44.502 --> 00:16:46.627
of a long walk back
to Hill Valley from here.

308
00:16:46.661 --> 00:16:48.049
It's still the safest plan.

309
00:16:48.096 --> 00:16:50.902
After all, we can't risk sending
you back into a populated area,

310
00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.178
or to a spot that's
geographically unknown.

311
00:16:53.218 --> 00:16:54.938
You don't want to crash
into some tree...

312
00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:56.612
that once existed in the past.

313
00:16:56.637 --> 00:16:59.127
This was all completely open country.

314
00:16:59.173 --> 00:17:01.854
So, you'll have plenty of
run out space when you arrive.

315
00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:04.846
Remember, where you're going,
there are no roads.

316
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.460
There's a small cave over there,

317
00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:08.737
which will be a perfect place
to hide the time vehicle.

318
00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:13.268
Well, the new time circuit
control tubes are warmed up.

319
00:17:15.716 --> 00:17:17.338
Time circuits on.

320
00:17:17.363 --> 00:17:18.745
I wrote the letter
on September 1st,

321
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.049
so, we'll send you back
the very next day,

322
00:17:20.074 --> 00:17:21.323
September 2nd.
That's Wednesday.

323
00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:23.909
September 2nd, 1885, 8:00 a.m.

324
00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.495
I get shot on Monday the 7th,

325
00:17:25.526 --> 00:17:27.016
so, you have five days
to locate me.

326
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:28.338
According to my letter,
I'm a blacksmith,

327
00:17:28.363 --> 00:17:30.651
so, I probably have
a shop somewhere.

328
00:17:30.768 --> 00:17:32.948
All you have to do is
drive the time vehicle...

329
00:17:32.973 --> 00:17:34.415
directly toward that screen,

330
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.634
accelerating to 88 miles an hour.

331
00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:38.057
Wait a minute, Doc.

332
00:17:38.082 --> 00:17:39.729
If I drive straight towards the screen,

333
00:17:39.754 --> 00:17:41.330
I'm gonna crash
into those Indians.

334
00:17:41.355 --> 00:17:44.659
Marty, you're not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

335
00:17:44.684 --> 00:17:47.127
You'll instantly be
transported to 1885,

336
00:17:47.152 --> 00:17:50.026
and those Indians
won't even be there.

337
00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.424
Right.

338
00:17:51.495 --> 00:17:52.995
Well.

339
00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:56.596
Good luck!
For both of our sakes.

340
00:17:56.694 --> 00:17:58.612
See you in the future.

341
00:17:58.948 --> 00:18:00.081
You mean the past.

342
00:18:00.107 --> 00:18:01.541
Exactly.

343
00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:10.476
Happy trails, Marty!

344
00:18:15.608 --> 00:18:17.414
Ready, Marty?

345
00:18:17.854 --> 00:18:19.593
Ready!

346
00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:20.976
Set.

347
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.757
Hi-ho, Silver.

348
00:18:34.114 --> 00:18:37.295
Viya con dios!

349
00:18:59.613 --> 00:19:01.829
Indians!

350
00:19:40.605 --> 00:19:42.175
The cave.

351
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.212
Charge!

352
00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:24.071
Shit! The cavalry.

353
00:20:29.345 --> 00:20:31.829
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

354
00:21:14.255 --> 00:21:16.611
Damn, I ripped the fuel line.

355
00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:02.446
Maggie!

356
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.696
Fetch some water.
We got a hurt man here.

357
00:22:13.373 --> 00:22:14.643
Mom.

358
00:22:14.792 --> 00:22:16.057
 Mom, is that you?

359
00:22:16.095 --> 00:22:17.369
There, there now.

360
00:22:17.435 --> 00:22:20.557
You've been asleep
for nearly six hours now.

361
00:22:20.655 --> 00:22:23.095
I had this horrible nightmare.

362
00:22:24.638 --> 00:22:26.222
I dreamed...

363
00:22:26.683 --> 00:22:29.144
I dreamed I was in a Western.

364
00:22:29.618 --> 00:22:31.799
I was being chased by all these...

365
00:22:31.925 --> 00:22:33.690
Indians,

366
00:22:34.353 --> 00:22:36.190
and a bear.

367
00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:39.948
Well, you're safe and sound
here now at the McFly farm.

368
00:22:40.396 --> 00:22:42.127
McFly farm?

369
00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:46.752
Well, you're my...

370
00:22:46.855 --> 00:22:49.284
you're my, my--

371
00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:52.010
Who are you?

372
00:22:52.049 --> 00:22:54.674
The name is McFly.
Maggie McFly.

373
00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:56.292
McFly.

374
00:22:57.089 --> 00:22:58.378
Maggie?

375
00:22:58.418 --> 00:23:01.659
And that's Mrs. McFly, and
don't you be forgetting the Mrs.

376
00:23:01.684 --> 00:23:03.057
And what might your name be, sir?

377
00:23:03.082 --> 00:23:04.729
Well, it's Mc--

378
00:23:08.356 --> 00:23:09.916
Eastwood?

379
00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:12.455
Uh, Clint.

380
00:23:12.581 --> 00:23:14.143
Clint Eastwood.

381
00:23:14.259 --> 00:23:16.052
Well, you hit your head,
Mr. Eastwood.

382
00:23:16.077 --> 00:23:17.760
Not too serious.
But lucky for you,

383
00:23:17.787 --> 00:23:19.650
Seamus found you when he did.

384
00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:21.377
Seamus?

385
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.291
Me husband.

386
00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:28.502
You'll be excusing me, Mr. Eastwood,
while I tend to William.

387
00:23:29.094 --> 00:23:30.228
William?

388
00:23:30.253 --> 00:23:32.096
Oh, that's okay, Will.

389
00:23:32.174 --> 00:23:33.791
It's okay.

390
00:23:39.978 --> 00:23:42.141
- That's William?
- Aye.

391
00:23:42.168 --> 00:23:43.595
William Sean McFly.

392
00:23:43.626 --> 00:23:46.282
The first of our family
to be born in America.

393
00:23:46.336 --> 00:23:48.204
All okay, okay, Will?

394
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.571
This here is Mr. Clint Eastwood
here visiting.

395
00:23:51.753 --> 00:23:54.345
He surely likes you, Mr. Eastwood.

396
00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:56.415
Maggie.

397
00:23:58.383 --> 00:23:59.795
I've got supper.

398
00:23:59.836 --> 00:24:02.445
I'm not one to pry into
a man's personal affairs,

399
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.320
but exactly,

400
00:24:04.352 --> 00:24:06.836
how is it that you came
to be way out here...

401
00:24:06.877 --> 00:24:08.438
without a horse,

402
00:24:08.493 --> 00:24:09.962
or boots,

403
00:24:10.008 --> 00:24:11.329
or a hat?

404
00:24:11.357 --> 00:24:12.539
Well,

405
00:24:12.564 --> 00:24:13.617
my car,

406
00:24:13.657 --> 00:24:15.360
horse broke down, and, and...

407
00:24:15.399 --> 00:24:17.172
a bear ate my boots, and...

408
00:24:17.197 --> 00:24:18.719
I guess I just forgot my hat.

409
00:24:18.748 --> 00:24:21.414
How could you forget
a thing like your hat?

410
00:24:21.516 --> 00:24:23.134
Would you like some water?

411
00:24:23.174 --> 00:24:24.774
Uh, yeah.

412
00:24:34.726 --> 00:24:37.149
I'll tell you what I'll do,
Mr. Eastwood.

413
00:24:37.235 --> 00:24:40.234
I'll help you find
your blacksmith friend.

414
00:24:40.868 --> 00:24:43.828
You can stay the night in the barn.

415
00:24:44.097 --> 00:24:45.266
And tomorrow,

416
00:24:45.305 --> 00:24:47.347
I'll take you as far as
the railroad tracks.

417
00:24:47.372 --> 00:24:50.253
You can follow them
straight on into town.

418
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.902
I'll even give you a hat.

419
00:24:57.658 --> 00:24:59.928
That's great. Thanks.

420
00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:04.170
Uh...

421
00:25:04.333 --> 00:25:06.162
that's my William.

422
00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:08.053
Woogie William.

423
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.553
Woogie William

424
00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.115
Oh.

425
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.584
Yes.

426
00:25:14.194 --> 00:25:16.756
I think you'll find
the barn comfortable.

427
00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:19.436
Never had any complaints
about it from the pigs.

428
00:25:19.743 --> 00:25:21.756
- Mm.
- Seamus.

429
00:25:21.901 --> 00:25:23.561
A word with you.

430
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.045
Aye.

431
00:25:27.756 --> 00:25:30.682
Will you hold him for a minute?

432
00:25:34.073 --> 00:25:36.515
Are you sure you're not after
bringing a curse on this house

433
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.643
taking him in like that?

434
00:25:38.794 --> 00:25:40.198
He's such a strange young man.

435
00:25:40.223 --> 00:25:43.096
Aye. But, I've just got
a feeling about him, Maggie.

436
00:25:43.221 --> 00:25:45.799
Looking after him
is the right thing to do.

437
00:25:45.887 --> 00:25:47.354
That's important.

438
00:25:47.435 --> 00:25:48.823
Hey, buddy.

439
00:25:49.006 --> 00:25:51.299
Look how the baby takes to him.

440
00:25:51.459 --> 00:25:54.463
Little Will never takes to strangers.

441
00:25:55.063 --> 00:25:57.041
It's almost as if...

442
00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:58.283
he's connected to us.

443
00:25:58.308 --> 00:25:59.308
Hey, Will.

444
00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:02.374
So, you're my great-grandfather.

445
00:26:02.594 --> 00:26:05.627
First McFly born in America.

446
00:26:10.663 --> 00:26:12.749
And you peed on me.

447
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:06.382
- Hand me some soap, Wang.
- Uh, here you go.

448
00:27:16.114 --> 00:27:18.132
Please, watch it.

449
00:28:52.706 --> 00:28:56.380
Take a look and see
what just breezed in the door.

450
00:28:57.966 --> 00:29:00.896
Why, I didn't know
the circus was in town.

451
00:29:00.938 --> 00:29:05.679
Must have got that shirt
off from a dead Chinese.

452
00:29:24.432 --> 00:29:26.627
What will it be, stranger?

453
00:29:26.714 --> 00:29:28.175
Uh...

454
00:29:28.741 --> 00:29:30.479
I'll have, uh...

455
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.525
- ice water.
- An ice?

456
00:29:35.258 --> 00:29:36.348
Water?

457
00:29:36.394 --> 00:29:38.364
You want water,
you better go dunk your head...

458
00:29:38.395 --> 00:29:40.817
in the horse trough out there.

459
00:29:41.012 --> 00:29:42.504
In here,

460
00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:44.967
we pour whiskey.

461
00:29:54.901 --> 00:29:56.174
Excuse me.

462
00:29:56.218 --> 00:29:57.447
For what?

463
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.088
I'm trying to find the blacksmith.

464
00:30:01.032 --> 00:30:02.683
Hey, McFly!

465
00:30:04.469 --> 00:30:07.394
Thought I done told
you never to come in--

466
00:30:08.952 --> 00:30:11.386
You ain't Seamus McFly.

467
00:30:12.473 --> 00:30:14.097
You look like him, though.

468
00:30:14.132 --> 00:30:16.737
Especially, with that dog-ugly hat.

469
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:21.295
You kin to that hay barber?

470
00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:23.209
What's your name, dude?

471
00:30:23.241 --> 00:30:24.662
Uh, Marty.

472
00:30:25.922 --> 00:30:27.209
Eastwood.

473
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.380
Clint Eastwood.

474
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.310
What kind of stupid name is that?

475
00:30:34.352 --> 00:30:36.326
I'd say he's the runt of the litter.

476
00:30:36.351 --> 00:30:37.399
Hey, now, boys.

477
00:30:37.424 --> 00:30:39.381
Would you take a look-see
at these pearly whites?

478
00:30:39.406 --> 00:30:40.974
Hell, I ain't seen teeth
look that straight...

479
00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:42.145
that weren't store-bought.

480
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.826
Take a gander at them moccasins.

481
00:30:43.851 --> 00:30:45.529
What kind of skins is them?

482
00:30:45.588 --> 00:30:46.788
What's that writing mean?

483
00:30:46.813 --> 00:30:48.055
"Nike."
What is that?

484
00:30:48.085 --> 00:30:50.594
Some sort of Injun talk
or something?

485
00:30:52.757 --> 00:30:54.067
Bartender,

486
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.612
I'm looking for that no-good,
cheating blacksmith.

487
00:30:56.637 --> 00:30:57.856
You seen him?

488
00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.598
No, sir, Mr. Tannen.
I have not.

489
00:31:01.272 --> 00:31:02.528
Tannen?

490
00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:05.661
You're "Mad Dog" Tannen.

491
00:31:11.182 --> 00:31:12.868
Mad Dog?

492
00:31:12.985 --> 00:31:14.921
I hate that name.

493
00:31:15.381 --> 00:31:17.819
I hate it, you hear?

494
00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:20.788
Nobody calls me "Mad Dog"!

495
00:31:21.066 --> 00:31:25.968
Especially, not some duded-up,
egg-sucking gutter trash.

496
00:31:27.172 --> 00:31:28.616
Dance!

497
00:31:29.215 --> 00:31:30.530
Come on!

498
00:31:31.938 --> 00:31:33.569
Come on, runt.

499
00:31:33.624 --> 00:31:36.057
You can dance better than that.

500
00:31:45.523 --> 00:31:47.085
Shit.

501
00:31:47.812 --> 00:31:49.351
Woo!

502
00:31:52.971 --> 00:31:54.572
Oh.

503
00:31:57.903 --> 00:31:59.629
Ew.

504
00:32:08.543 --> 00:32:09.793
You better run, squirrel.

505
00:32:09.818 --> 00:32:11.551
Y'all, get him!

506
00:32:14.372 --> 00:32:16.333
Get him, get him!

507
00:32:23.465 --> 00:32:25.923
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

508
00:33:15.115 --> 00:33:17.821
We got ourselves a new courthouse!

509
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.539
High time we had a hanging!

510
00:33:39.567 --> 00:33:41.864
Look at him swing.

511
00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:44.802
Woo!

512
00:33:44.872 --> 00:33:45.942
Yeah.

513
00:33:45.974 --> 00:33:48.560
Haven't had a hanging
in a long time.

514
00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:53.108
It'll shoot the fleas
off a dog's back...

515
00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:55.030
at 500 yards, Tannen.

516
00:33:55.079 --> 00:33:57.561
And it's pointed straight
at your head.

517
00:34:07.203 --> 00:34:08.795
You owe me money, blacksmith.

518
00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.297
How do you figure?

519
00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:11.930
My horse threw a shoe.

520
00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:13.563
And seeing as you was the one
that done the shoeing,

521
00:34:13.588 --> 00:34:15.141
I say that makes you responsible.

522
00:34:15.166 --> 00:34:17.474
Well, since you never
paid me for the job,

523
00:34:17.498 --> 00:34:19.240
I say that makes us even.

524
00:34:19.265 --> 00:34:20.279
Wrong!

525
00:34:20.304 --> 00:34:22.162
See, I was on my horse
when it threw the shoe,

526
00:34:22.194 --> 00:34:23.301
and I got throwed off.

527
00:34:23.326 --> 00:34:26.059
And that caused me to bust
a perfectly good bottle...

528
00:34:26.084 --> 00:34:27.810
of fine Kentucky red eye.

529
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.756
So the way I figure it, blacksmith,

530
00:34:29.788 --> 00:34:31.787
you owe me $5 for the whiskey...

531
00:34:31.812 --> 00:34:34.412
and $75 for the horse!

532
00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:36.011
That's 80 dollars!

533
00:34:36.055 --> 00:34:38.537
Look, if your horse threw a shoe,

534
00:34:38.568 --> 00:34:40.623
bring him back,
and I'll reshoe him.

535
00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:42.279
And I shot that horse!

536
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:44.568
Well, that's your problem, Tannen.

537
00:34:44.594 --> 00:34:45.920
Wrong.

538
00:34:46.014 --> 00:34:47.522
That's yours.

539
00:34:47.584 --> 00:34:49.013
So from now on,

540
00:34:49.061 --> 00:34:51.521
you better be looking
behind you when you walk.

541
00:34:51.546 --> 00:34:54.763
'Cause one day, you're gonna
get a bullet in your back.

542
00:35:03.918 --> 00:35:04.997
Doc!

543
00:35:05.036 --> 00:35:06.590
Marty!

544
00:35:07.145 --> 00:35:09.254
I gave you explicit instructions,

545
00:35:09.301 --> 00:35:12.581
not to come here but
to go directly back to 1985.

546
00:35:12.606 --> 00:35:14.942
I know, Doc.
But, I had to come.

547
00:35:15.915 --> 00:35:18.262
But it's good to see you, Marty.

548
00:35:22.472 --> 00:35:24.818
Marty, you're gonna have to do
something about those clothes.

549
00:35:24.843 --> 00:35:27.656
You walk around town dressed like that,
you're liable to get shot.

550
00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.801
Or hanged.

551
00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:31.310
What idiot dressed you
in that outfit?

552
00:35:32.007 --> 00:35:33.455
You did.

553
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:37.302
"Shot in the back...

554
00:35:37.334 --> 00:35:38.693
"by Buford Tannen...

555
00:35:38.732 --> 00:35:40.771
"over a matter of 80 dollars.

556
00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:42.838
"September 7"?

557
00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.916
That's this Monday.

558
00:35:45.296 --> 00:35:47.572
Now, I wish I'd paid him off.

559
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.681
And who's this beloved Clara?

560
00:35:49.706 --> 00:35:51.822
I don't know anyone named Clara.

561
00:35:52.031 --> 00:35:54.134
I don't know, Doc.

562
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.118
I thought, maybe,
she was a girlfriend of yours.

563
00:35:57.157 --> 00:36:00.533
Marty, my involvement
in such a social relationship...

564
00:36:00.588 --> 00:36:02.502
here in 1885...

565
00:36:02.568 --> 00:36:06.378
could result in a disruption
of the space-time continuum.

566
00:36:06.489 --> 00:36:08.292
As a scientist,

567
00:36:08.855 --> 00:36:11.487
I can never take that risk.

568
00:36:12.155 --> 00:36:14.753
Certainly not after what
we've already been through.

569
00:36:14.802 --> 00:36:16.003
Emmett!

570
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:17.433
Ho Emmett!!

571
00:36:17.472 --> 00:36:18.693
Hubert!

572
00:36:18.865 --> 00:36:20.060
It's the mayor.

573
00:36:20.129 --> 00:36:21.919
Excuse me, Emmett.

574
00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:24.519
Do you remember last week
at the town meeting...

575
00:36:24.544 --> 00:36:26.693
when you volunteered to meet
the new school teacher...

576
00:36:26.718 --> 00:36:28.820
- at the station when she came in?
- Oh, yes, quite so.

577
00:36:28.845 --> 00:36:31.326
Well, we just got word
she's coming in tomorrow.

578
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.326
Here are the details for you.

579
00:36:33.413 --> 00:36:34.943
Thanks for all your help.

580
00:36:34.982 --> 00:36:36.802
Anytime, Hubert.

581
00:36:36.908 --> 00:36:38.029
Oh.

582
00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:39.622
Her name's Miss Clayton.

583
00:36:39.685 --> 00:36:41.545
Clara Clayton.

584
00:36:49.495 --> 00:36:51.349
Well, Doc.

585
00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:54.615
Now, we know who Clara is.

586
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:57.646
Marty, it's impossible.

587
00:36:57.728 --> 00:37:00.364
The idea that I could
fall in love at first sight...

588
00:37:00.427 --> 00:37:02.107
is romantic nonsense.

589
00:37:02.171 --> 00:37:04.130
There's no scientific rationale...

590
00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:05.169
- for that concept.
- Oh, come on, Doc.

591
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.560
It's not science.

592
00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:08.401
You meet the right girl,
it just hits you.

593
00:37:08.426 --> 00:37:10.918
- It's like lightning.
- Marty, please, don't say that.

594
00:37:10.943 --> 00:37:13.263
That's the way it was
for me and Jennifer.

595
00:37:13.336 --> 00:37:15.982
I mean, we couldn't keep
our eyes off each other.

596
00:37:16.559 --> 00:37:18.669
God, Jennifer, damn.
I hope she's all right, Doc.

597
00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:20.997
I can't believe we just
left her there on the porch.

598
00:37:21.063 --> 00:37:23.114
Don't worry, Marty.
She'll be fine.

599
00:37:23.166 --> 00:37:25.364
When you burned
the almanac in 1955,

600
00:37:25.389 --> 00:37:27.060
the normal timeline was restored.

601
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:28.880
That means once we're back in 1985,

602
00:37:28.905 --> 00:37:31.036
you just have to go over
to her house to wake her up.

603
00:37:32.102 --> 00:37:33.388
Oh, Marty.

604
00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:34.966
Turn that valve over there.

605
00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.271
All the way to the right.

606
00:37:36.296 --> 00:37:38.333
Yeah, pull it all the way around.

607
00:37:38.379 --> 00:37:40.192
Okay. Let's go.

608
00:37:53.789 --> 00:37:55.253
Iced tea?

609
00:37:55.383 --> 00:37:56.807
No, thanks.

610
00:37:57.366 --> 00:37:58.979
It's a refrigerator.

611
00:37:59.298 --> 00:38:01.088
Well, I guess Miss Clayton...

612
00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.081
will have to find
other transportation.

613
00:38:03.135 --> 00:38:04.206
If I never meet the woman,

614
00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:06.448
there's no possibility of
a romantic infatuation, right?

615
00:38:06.479 --> 00:38:08.323
- You're the doc, Doc.
- All right.

616
00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:09.432
We'll get the DeLorean,

617
00:38:09.457 --> 00:38:11.049
and get ourselves
back to the future.

618
00:38:11.074 --> 00:38:12.120
Oh, listen, Doc.

619
00:38:12.145 --> 00:38:13.930
I tore a hole in the gas tank
when I was landing.

620
00:38:13.955 --> 00:38:16.331
So, we're gonna have to
patch it up and get some gas.

621
00:38:16.379 --> 00:38:18.502
You mean we're out of gas?

622
00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.838
Yeah, it's no big deal.

623
00:38:19.863 --> 00:38:21.488
We've got Mr. Fusion, right?

624
00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:25.349
Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits
and the Flux Capacitor.

625
00:38:25.449 --> 00:38:28.621
But, the internal combustion
engine runs on ordinary gasoline.

626
00:38:28.646 --> 00:38:30.304
It always has.

627
00:38:30.351 --> 00:38:32.535
There's not gonna be
a gas station around here...

628
00:38:32.568 --> 00:38:34.934
until sometime in the next century.

629
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.637
Without gasoline,

630
00:38:36.693 --> 00:38:40.895
we can't get the DeLorean
up to 88 miles per hour.

631
00:38:42.473 --> 00:38:44.098
So, what do we do?

632
00:38:54.485 --> 00:38:55.970
Twenty-four!

633
00:38:56.048 --> 00:38:57.681
It's no use, Marty!

634
00:38:57.706 --> 00:38:59.916
Even the fastest horse in the world...

635
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.181
won't run more than
35, 40 miles an hour.

636
00:39:13.307 --> 00:39:16.158
Bartender said that's
the strongest stuff they got.

637
00:39:16.488 --> 00:39:18.174
Try it, Marty.

638
00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.388
Give it more gas.

639
00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.972
Damn!

640
00:39:43.495 --> 00:39:46.080
It blew the fuel injection manifold.

641
00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:48.144
Strong stuff, all right.

642
00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.941
It will take me a month
to rebuild it.

643
00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:52.871
A month?

644
00:39:53.074 --> 00:39:54.955
Doc, you're gonna
get shot on Monday.

645
00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.800
I know, I know, I know.

646
00:39:56.879 --> 00:39:58.230
I wish...

647
00:39:58.558 --> 00:39:59.871
Wait.

648
00:40:00.035 --> 00:40:01.183
I've got it.

649
00:40:01.214 --> 00:40:03.064
We can simply roll it
down a steep hill.

650
00:40:03.089 --> 00:40:05.277
No, we'd never find
a smooth enough surface.

651
00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.304
Unless...

652
00:40:06.339 --> 00:40:07.429
Of course!

653
00:40:07.454 --> 00:40:08.476
Ice.

654
00:40:08.515 --> 00:40:10.857
We'll wait until winter
when the lake freezes over.

655
00:40:10.882 --> 00:40:12.675
Winter, Doc?
What are you talking about?

656
00:40:12.699 --> 00:40:14.199
Monday, it's three days away.

657
00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:15.246
All right, all right, all right.

658
00:40:15.271 --> 00:40:17.989
Just, let's think this thing
through logically.

659
00:40:18.363 --> 00:40:20.191
We know it won't run
under its own power.

660
00:40:20.223 --> 00:40:22.071
We know we can't pull it.

661
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:23.394
But,

662
00:40:23.457 --> 00:40:25.660
if we could figure out a way...

663
00:40:25.698 --> 00:40:29.542
to push it up to 88 miles an hour.

664
00:40:29.874 --> 00:40:31.095
Huh?

665
00:40:38.653 --> 00:40:39.905
That's it.

666
00:40:39.949 --> 00:40:41.530
How fast can she go?

667
00:40:41.609 --> 00:40:44.351
Why, I've had her up to 55 myself.

668
00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:45.913
I heard that, uh,

669
00:40:45.938 --> 00:40:48.420
Fearless Frank Fargo got
one of these up to near 70,

670
00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:50.171
out past Verde Junction.

671
00:40:50.241 --> 00:40:52.993
Do you think it's possible
to get it up to 90?

672
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:54.270
Hah! Ninety?

673
00:40:54.306 --> 00:40:56.759
Tarnations son, why'd you
ever need to be in such a hurry?

674
00:40:56.813 --> 00:40:59.446
It's just a little bet
he and I have, that's all.

675
00:40:59.498 --> 00:41:02.000
Theoretically speaking,
could it be done?

676
00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:03.313
Well, I suppose,

677
00:41:03.345 --> 00:41:05.954
if you had a straight stretch
of track with a level grade,

678
00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:08.337
and you weren't hauling
no cars behind you,

679
00:41:08.391 --> 00:41:10.366
and if you could get
the fire hot enough.

680
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:14.266
And I'm talking about hotter than
the blazes of hell and damnation itself.

681
00:41:14.406 --> 00:41:16.787
Then yes, sir, it might be
possible to get her up that fast.

682
00:41:16.812 --> 00:41:18.883
Tell me, when does the next
train come through here?

683
00:41:18.915 --> 00:41:20.397
Monday morning at 8 o'clock.

684
00:41:20.422 --> 00:41:21.508
Here.

685
00:41:21.533 --> 00:41:24.617
This spur that runs off the main line
three miles out to Clayton Ravine.

686
00:41:24.642 --> 00:41:26.234
It's a long stretch of level track...

687
00:41:26.273 --> 00:41:28.562
that will still exist in 1985.

688
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:31.875
This is where we'll push
the DeLorean with the locomotive.

689
00:41:32.133 --> 00:41:33.297
Funny.

690
00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:35.836
This map calls Clayton Ravine
Shonash Ravine.

691
00:41:35.867 --> 00:41:37.945
That must be the old
Indian name for it.

692
00:41:37.976 --> 00:41:39.172
It's perfect.

693
00:41:39.205 --> 00:41:42.039
A nice long run that goes clear
across the bridge over the ravine.

694
00:41:42.077 --> 00:41:44.412
You know, over near that
Hilldale housing development?

695
00:41:44.475 --> 00:41:47.243
Right, Doc.
But, according to this map,

696
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.297
there is no bridge.

697
00:41:49.352 --> 00:41:50.766
Well, Doc.

698
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:52.875
We can scratch that idea.

699
00:41:52.946 --> 00:41:54.563
I mean, we can't wait around
a year and a half...

700
00:41:54.588 --> 00:41:55.647
for this thing to get finished.

701
00:41:55.672 --> 00:41:56.993
Marty, it's perfect.

702
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.399
You're just not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

703
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.149
Right, right. I have
a real problem with that.

704
00:42:01.174 --> 00:42:02.196
Don't you see?

705
00:42:02.235 --> 00:42:04.969
The bridge will exist in 1985.

706
00:42:05.008 --> 00:42:06.768
It's safe and still in use.

707
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:08.713
Therefore, as long as
we get the DeLorean up...

708
00:42:08.745 --> 00:42:09.954
to 88 miles an hour...

709
00:42:09.979 --> 00:42:11.580
before we hit the edge
of the ravine,

710
00:42:11.635 --> 00:42:14.282
we'll instantaneously
arrive at a point in time...

711
00:42:14.307 --> 00:42:16.284
where the bridge is completed.

712
00:42:16.396 --> 00:42:18.252
We'll have track under us...

713
00:42:18.354 --> 00:42:21.635
and coast safely across the ravine.

714
00:42:22.018 --> 00:42:23.190
What about the locomotive?

715
00:42:23.226 --> 00:42:25.260
It will be a spectacular wreck.

716
00:42:25.318 --> 00:42:27.362
Too bad no one will be around to see it.

717
00:42:27.393 --> 00:42:28.830
Help!

718
00:42:28.878 --> 00:42:30.541
Help me!

719
00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:32.362
- Help!
- Great Scott!

720
00:43:14.986 --> 00:43:16.498
Hurry!

721
00:43:18.143 --> 00:43:19.537
Jump!

722
00:43:29.481 --> 00:43:30.684
Whoa.

723
00:43:31.249 --> 00:43:32.591
Whoa.

724
00:43:32.964 --> 00:43:34.099
Oh.

725
00:43:34.147 --> 00:43:35.294
Thank you, sir.

726
00:43:35.319 --> 00:43:36.905
You saved my...

727
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:40.589
life.

728
00:43:44.432 --> 00:43:46.996
Emmett Brown
at your service, Miss.

729
00:43:47.027 --> 00:43:48.363
I'm...

730
00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:50.371
I'm...

731
00:43:50.441 --> 00:43:51.761
Clayton.

732
00:43:53.363 --> 00:43:54.824
Clara Clayton.

733
00:43:56.003 --> 00:43:57.386
Clara!

734
00:44:00.612 --> 00:44:02.729
What a beautiful name!

735
00:44:19.714 --> 00:44:22.271
May I help you inside with these?

736
00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:25.449
Oh, no, that won't be necessary.
I can take care of it.

737
00:44:25.474 --> 00:44:27.771
You've done more than enough already.

738
00:44:27.888 --> 00:44:29.521
But, it's really no trouble.

739
00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:31.216
Doc, she says it's fine.

740
00:44:31.241 --> 00:44:32.309
We got to get going.

741
00:44:32.349 --> 00:44:35.772
Ma'am, good luck with
your school teaching and everything.

742
00:44:36.296 --> 00:44:37.904
Clara.

743
00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.107
I'll straighten everything out with
Mr. Statler for the buckboard rental.

744
00:44:41.132 --> 00:44:42.568
Don't you worry about that.

745
00:44:42.607 --> 00:44:44.677
I feel somewhat responsible
for what happened.

746
00:44:44.706 --> 00:44:46.045
Oh.

747
00:44:46.091 --> 00:44:49.138
Well, that would be very
gentlemanly of you, Mr. Brown.

748
00:44:49.256 --> 00:44:50.819
Emmett.

749
00:44:53.086 --> 00:44:54.623
You know, I'm...

750
00:44:54.701 --> 00:44:57.271
I'm almost glad that snake
spooked those horses.

751
00:44:57.302 --> 00:44:59.959
Otherwise, we might never have met.

752
00:45:00.076 --> 00:45:02.146
I suppose, it was destiny.

753
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:07.410
Well, thank you for everything.

754
00:45:07.785 --> 00:45:09.754
You're quite welcome.

755
00:45:11.835 --> 00:45:14.488
I will see you again, won't I?

756
00:45:14.586 --> 00:45:16.113
Of course.
You'll see lots of me.

757
00:45:16.138 --> 00:45:17.644
I'm sure.
I have a shop in town.

758
00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.894
I'm the local scientist.

759
00:45:18.926 --> 00:45:20.949
Ah-ah, no, black, blacksmith.

760
00:45:21.095 --> 00:45:22.144
Science?

761
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.933
What sort of science?

762
00:45:23.975 --> 00:45:26.035
Astronomy? Chemistry?

763
00:45:26.105 --> 00:45:28.613
Actually, I'm a student of all sciences.

764
00:45:28.652 --> 00:45:30.168
Hey, Doc?

765
00:45:30.645 --> 00:45:31.754
We got to get going.

766
00:45:31.801 --> 00:45:34.769
Oh, yes.
Well, excuse us, Clara.

767
00:45:35.033 --> 00:45:37.293
We have to get going.

768
00:45:41.337 --> 00:45:42.931
Toodle-oo.

769
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:52.892
What do you mean, you're gonna
be seeing lots of her, Doc?

770
00:45:52.919 --> 00:45:55.908
Well, I might see her
again just in passing.

771
00:45:56.103 --> 00:45:57.181
Come on, Doc.

772
00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:59.525
Did you see the way
she was looking at you?

773
00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:02.650
She did have quite a scare, right?

774
00:46:03.166 --> 00:46:04.899
After all, Miss Clayton almost ended up

775
00:46:04.924 --> 00:46:06.791
at the bottom of Clayton Ravine.

776
00:46:06.861 --> 00:46:09.900
- Clayton Ravine?
- Holy shit! Hey, Doc.

777
00:46:10.251 --> 00:46:12.924
Clayton Ravine was named
after a teacher.

778
00:46:13.071 --> 00:46:15.228
They say she fell in there
a hundred years ago.

779
00:46:15.259 --> 00:46:16.705
A hundred years ago?

780
00:46:16.963 --> 00:46:17.970
That's this year.

781
00:46:17.995 --> 00:46:19.496
Every kid in school knows that story,

782
00:46:19.521 --> 00:46:22.330
'cause we all have teachers
we'd like to see fall into the ravine.

783
00:46:22.405 --> 00:46:24.181
Great Scott!

784
00:46:25.252 --> 00:46:28.416
Then she was supposed
to go over in that wagon.

785
00:46:29.533 --> 00:46:32.877
And now, I may have
seriously altered history.

786
00:46:33.642 --> 00:46:35.158
Look, Doc.

787
00:46:35.556 --> 00:46:37.062
What's the worst
that can happen, huh?

788
00:46:37.087 --> 00:46:38.853
So they don't name
the ravine after her.

789
00:46:39.314 --> 00:46:40.687
Let's just get the DeLorean ready,

790
00:46:40.712 --> 00:46:41.931
and get the hell out of here.

791
00:46:41.956 --> 00:46:45.548
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

792
00:46:46.411 --> 00:46:49.837
It's caused nothing but disaster.

793
00:46:52.837 --> 00:46:54.203
Doc, Doc, this is Marty.

794
00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:55.288
Do you read me?
Over.

795
00:46:55.313 --> 00:46:56.375
Check, Marty.

796
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.697
Great, Doc.
These things still work.

797
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:00.314
All right, Marty.

798
00:47:00.388 --> 00:47:03.681
Once more, let's go over
the entire plan and layout.

799
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:05.853
I apologize for the crudity
of this model.

800
00:47:05.878 --> 00:47:08.087
- But, I just--
- Yeah, I know, Doc. It's not to scale.

801
00:47:08.127 --> 00:47:10.087
- It's okay, Doc.
- All right.

802
00:47:10.166 --> 00:47:12.361
Tomorrow night, Sunday,

803
00:47:12.595 --> 00:47:15.923
we'll load the DeLorean onto
the tracks here, on the spur,

804
00:47:15.962 --> 00:47:17.891
right by the old abandoned silver mine.

805
00:47:17.924 --> 00:47:20.939
The switch track is where
the spur runs off the main line...

806
00:47:20.968 --> 00:47:22.684
three miles out to Clayton,

807
00:47:22.973 --> 00:47:24.536
Shonash Ravine.

808
00:47:24.601 --> 00:47:27.301
The train leaves the station
at eight Monday morning.

809
00:47:27.358 --> 00:47:28.410
We'll stop it here,

810
00:47:28.442 --> 00:47:30.036
uncouple the cars from the tender,

811
00:47:30.061 --> 00:47:32.152
throw the switch track,
and then we'll hijack--

812
00:47:32.191 --> 00:47:34.152
Borrow the locomotive and use it...

813
00:47:34.191 --> 00:47:36.316
to push the time machine.

814
00:47:36.348 --> 00:47:37.707
According to my calculations,

815
00:47:37.732 --> 00:47:39.168
we'll reach 88 miles per hour...

816
00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:41.121
just before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

817
00:47:41.146 --> 00:47:42.910
at which point we'll be
instantaneously...

818
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.973
transported back to 1985,

819
00:47:45.006 --> 00:47:47.574
and coast safely across
the completed bridge.

820
00:47:47.747 --> 00:47:50.262
What does this mean?
"Point of no return."?

821
00:47:50.297 --> 00:47:52.160
That's our fail-safe point.

822
00:47:52.185 --> 00:47:53.918
Up until there,
we still have enough time...

823
00:47:53.943 --> 00:47:56.348
to stop the locomotive before
it plunges into the ravine.

824
00:47:56.376 --> 00:47:57.652
But once we pass this windmill,

825
00:47:57.677 --> 00:47:59.629
it's the future or bust.

826
00:48:01.751 --> 00:48:02.887
Here you go, Marty.

827
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.645
Connect that to the positive terminal.

828
00:48:06.403 --> 00:48:07.613
All right, Marty, you all set?

829
00:48:07.638 --> 00:48:08.997
Yeah, yeah, go!

830
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.880
Train pulling out of the station.

831
00:48:12.043 --> 00:48:14.211
Coming up to the switch track.

832
00:48:14.297 --> 00:48:16.778
Stop at the switch track.

833
00:48:16.917 --> 00:48:18.981
Throw the switch.

834
00:48:19.269 --> 00:48:21.661
Pull up to the DeLorean.

835
00:48:21.754 --> 00:48:23.434
Pushing the DeLorean...

836
00:48:23.497 --> 00:48:26.599
up to 88 miles per hour.

837
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:34.313
It couldn't be simpler.

838
00:48:35.271 --> 00:48:36.594
Hello?

839
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.275
Emmett?

840
00:48:42.861 --> 00:48:44.444
It's Clara!

841
00:48:44.531 --> 00:48:46.893
Quick, cover the DeLorean.

842
00:48:53.646 --> 00:48:54.888
Hello.

843
00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.295
Why, hello.

844
00:48:56.346 --> 00:48:58.717
This is quite a surprise.

845
00:48:59.896 --> 00:49:02.256
Well, I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

846
00:49:02.281 --> 00:49:05.912
Oh, no, no, we were just
doing a little model railroading.

847
00:49:06.285 --> 00:49:07.615
Oh.

848
00:49:08.849 --> 00:49:12.092
Emmett, when my bags were
thrown from the wagon,

849
00:49:12.117 --> 00:49:13.927
my telescope was damaged.

850
00:49:13.952 --> 00:49:17.584
And since you mentioned
an interest in science,

851
00:49:17.627 --> 00:49:20.435
I thought you might
be able to repair it for me.

852
00:49:20.912 --> 00:49:24.490
- I, I would pay you, of course.
- Oh. No, no, no.

853
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.271
I wouldn't think of
charging you for this.

854
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.474
Well, let's have a look at it.

855
00:49:29.594 --> 00:49:32.896
I think a lens may be
out of alignment because...

856
00:49:32.982 --> 00:49:35.513
if you, if you move it this way,

857
00:49:35.565 --> 00:49:37.435
the image turns fuzzy.

858
00:49:37.498 --> 00:49:38.670
See?

859
00:49:38.727 --> 00:49:40.713
But if, if you turn it...

860
00:49:41.526 --> 00:49:43.151
the other way...

861
00:49:43.323 --> 00:49:44.572
then--

862
00:49:44.634 --> 00:49:47.299
Everything becomes...

863
00:49:49.445 --> 00:49:50.935
clear.

864
00:49:55.963 --> 00:49:59.130
I could repair it right away
and have it for you tonight.

865
00:49:59.315 --> 00:50:01.535
Oh, tonight is the town festival.

866
00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:04.379
I wouldn't dream of having
you work on my telescope

867
00:50:04.404 --> 00:50:06.101
during such an important occasion.

868
00:50:06.126 --> 00:50:07.875
You, you are planning on...

869
00:50:07.922 --> 00:50:09.945
attending, aren't you?

870
00:50:10.289 --> 00:50:12.247
- Well, actually, ma'am, I don't think--
- Yes.

871
00:50:12.272 --> 00:50:14.273
Of course, the festival.

872
00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:16.847
Well, in that case,

873
00:50:16.903 --> 00:50:20.249
I'll see you this evening
at the festival, Emmett.

874
00:50:20.495 --> 00:50:23.023
- Mr. Eastwood.
- Ma'am.

875
00:50:25.625 --> 00:50:28.140
Thank you for taking
care of my telescope.

876
00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:30.218
You're quite welcome.

877
00:50:35.909 --> 00:50:37.558
It's a nice telescope.

878
00:50:37.612 --> 00:50:40.120
Ladies and gentlemen,

879
00:50:40.192 --> 00:50:42.386
as mayor of Hill Valley,

880
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.596
it gives me great pleasure...

881
00:50:44.621 --> 00:50:46.325
to dedicate this clock...

882
00:50:46.412 --> 00:50:49.029
- to the people of Hill County.
- Yeah.

883
00:50:49.061 --> 00:50:52.560
May it stand for all time!

884
00:50:52.724 --> 00:50:54.529
Tell me when, gentlemen.

885
00:50:55.224 --> 00:50:56.536
Three.

886
00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.240
Two.

887
00:50:58.326 --> 00:50:59.865
One.

888
00:50:59.954 --> 00:51:01.763
Now!

889
00:51:06.734 --> 00:51:09.596
Let the festivities begin!

890
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:17.915
You know, Marty,
in a way,

891
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.407
it's pretty amazing that
you and I are here to witness this.

892
00:51:20.462 --> 00:51:23.321
It's too bad I didn't bring my camera.

893
00:51:29.785 --> 00:51:31.473
Ready, gentlemen?

894
00:51:32.316 --> 00:51:35.567
The only problem is we'll never
be able to show it to anybody.

895
00:51:35.798 --> 00:51:37.127
Smile, Doc.

896
00:51:39.396 --> 00:51:41.315
Yee-ha!

897
00:52:01.658 --> 00:52:03.588
What great music!

898
00:52:04.097 --> 00:52:06.853
Yeah, it's got a beat,
and you can dance to it.

899
00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.127
Step right up gentlemen,

900
00:52:08.152 --> 00:52:10.135
and test your mettle
with the latest products...

901
00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.224
from Colonel Samuel Colt's Patent
Firearms Manufacturing Company...

902
00:52:14.258 --> 00:52:15.885
of Hartford, Connecticut.

903
00:52:15.928 --> 00:52:18.697
Now, take this model,
for example,

904
00:52:18.884 --> 00:52:22.553
the new improved and
refined Colt Peacemaker,

905
00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:28.189
selling to you tonight
for the low, low price of $12.

906
00:52:43.908 --> 00:52:46.166
- Good evening.
- Evening.

907
00:52:47.136 --> 00:52:49.299
You look very nice.

908
00:52:49.677 --> 00:52:51.136
Thank you.

909
00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:01.819
Would you like, uh...

910
00:53:03.439 --> 00:53:06.142
- Would you care to, to uh...
- I'd love to.

911
00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:26.398
Young man, how about you?
You want to give it a try?

912
00:53:26.423 --> 00:53:28.078
Uh, no, no, no, thanks.

913
00:53:28.103 --> 00:53:29.906
Hey, Doc, this...

914
00:53:37.616 --> 00:53:39.078
Son!

915
00:53:39.547 --> 00:53:42.414
- Sonny boy!
- The Doc can dance?

916
00:53:44.547 --> 00:53:45.862
Son.

917
00:53:45.964 --> 00:53:47.308
Son.

918
00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:48.635
Son!

919
00:53:48.699 --> 00:53:49.846
Hey, hey.

920
00:53:49.885 --> 00:53:53.198
I just told you that even
a baby could handle this weapon.

921
00:53:53.223 --> 00:53:56.370
Surely, you're not afraid to try
something that a baby could do.

922
00:53:56.395 --> 00:53:58.571
- Hey, I'm not afraid of nothing.
- Oh, come on, then.

923
00:53:58.596 --> 00:54:00.651
Let's just step up here like a man.

924
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:01.831
Now then,

925
00:54:01.856 --> 00:54:05.706
what you do is you just ease
that hammer back there and...

926
00:54:05.776 --> 00:54:07.057
squeeze off a round.

927
00:54:07.082 --> 00:54:08.471
No, no, no.

928
00:54:08.558 --> 00:54:11.596
Right on out there,
and be real smooth.

929
00:54:11.621 --> 00:54:13.768
That's the way you do it.

930
00:54:14.456 --> 00:54:16.706
Oh, oh, oh, God!

931
00:54:16.971 --> 00:54:18.502
Listen, can I try that again?

932
00:54:18.793 --> 00:54:20.791
Yeah, go on ahead.

933
00:54:32.347 --> 00:54:34.321
Hey, just tell me one thing.

934
00:54:34.346 --> 00:54:36.785
Where did you learn to shoot like that?

935
00:54:36.864 --> 00:54:38.543
7- Eleven.

936
00:54:43.059 --> 00:54:46.262
Buford, you sure that blacksmith
is gonna be at this here shindig?

937
00:54:46.322 --> 00:54:47.668
Sure, he's here.

938
00:54:47.692 --> 00:54:49.528
Everybody's here tonight.

939
00:54:51.738 --> 00:54:53.670
You gentlemen will have
to check your firearms...

940
00:54:53.695 --> 00:54:56.033
if you want to join in
on the festivities.

941
00:54:57.236 --> 00:54:59.471
Who's gonna make us,
tenderfoot? You?

942
00:54:59.513 --> 00:55:00.963
I am.

943
00:55:03.325 --> 00:55:04.624
Marshal Strickland.

944
00:55:04.678 --> 00:55:06.335
I didn't know you was back in town.

945
00:55:06.359 --> 00:55:08.015
If you can't read the sign, Tannen,

946
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.460
I presume you can read this.

947
00:55:10.616 --> 00:55:13.632
Pretty tough hombre when you're pointing
a scatter gun at a man's back.

948
00:55:13.659 --> 00:55:16.616
Just like you, Tannen,
I take every advantage I can get.

949
00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:19.241
Now, you gonna check your iron?

950
00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:22.444
I was just joking with your deputy.

951
00:55:22.507 --> 00:55:24.437
Of course, I'm gonna check my iron.

952
00:55:24.507 --> 00:55:26.054
We all were, weren't we, boys?

953
00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:27.694
Yeah, right.

954
00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:30.171
Tannen.

955
00:55:31.313 --> 00:55:33.116
Your knife too.

956
00:55:40.125 --> 00:55:41.667
Smile, Marshal.

957
00:55:41.714 --> 00:55:43.542
After all, this is a party.

958
00:55:43.567 --> 00:55:45.927
Only party I'll be smiling at...

959
00:55:45.952 --> 00:55:49.057
is the one that sees
you at the end of a rope.

960
00:55:51.245 --> 00:55:53.167
Have fun!

961
00:55:56.684 --> 00:55:59.098
That's how you handle them, Son.
Never give them an inch.

962
00:55:59.123 --> 00:56:01.512
And maintain discipline at all times.

963
00:56:01.545 --> 00:56:03.122
Remember that word:

964
00:56:03.403 --> 00:56:04.536
Discipline.

965
00:56:04.577 --> 00:56:06.130

Mr. Eastwood.

970
00:56:15.794 --> 00:56:17.387
Nice to see you.

971

some respectable clothes lad.

00:56:21.987 --> 00:56:25.424
Yeah, well, a couple people didn't like
the way the other one looked on me.

Far out.

978
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:37.301
What was the meaning of that?

979
00:56:37.344 --> 00:56:39.094

00:56:56.757 --> 00:56:58.546
There he is, Buford.

988
00:56:59.484 --> 00:57:01.257
- Where?
- There.

989
00:57:01.338 --> 00:57:03.452
Dancing with that piece of calico.

990
00:57:03.722 --> 00:57:05.886
What are you gonna do, boss?

991
00:57:07.792 --> 00:57:09.059
I figure.

992
00:57:09.091 --> 00:57:11.622
If I bury this muzzle
deep enough in his back,

993
00:57:11.653 --> 00:57:13.097
nobody will hear the shot.

994
00:57:13.122 --> 00:57:15.511
Careful, Buford, you ain't got
but one bullet with that.

995
00:57:15.536 --> 00:57:17.591
I only need one.

996
00:57:28.847 --> 00:57:31.121
I told you to watch your back, smithy.

997
00:57:31.146 --> 00:57:33.334
Tannen, but you're early.

998
00:57:33.359 --> 00:57:34.742
It's a Derringer, smithy.

999
00:57:34.774 --> 00:57:35.914
Small but effective.

1000
00:57:35.939 --> 00:57:38.578
The last time I used it,
fellow took two whole days to die.

1001
00:57:38.603 --> 00:57:41.656
Bled to death inside.
It was real, real painful.

1002
00:57:41.711 --> 00:57:45.148
That means you'll be dead
by about supper time Monday.

1003
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:48.243
Excuse me, I don't know who
you think you are, but we're dancing.

1004
00:57:48.268 --> 00:57:51.126
Well, look at what we have here.

1005
00:57:51.151 --> 00:57:52.766
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to the lady?

1006
00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:55.016
- I'd like a dance.
- I wouldn't give you the pleasure.

1007
00:57:55.041 --> 00:57:57.459
You just have to go ahead and shoot.

1008
00:57:57.493 --> 00:57:58.893
- All right.
- No, no.

1009
00:57:58.918 --> 00:58:00.045
Emmett, I'll dance with him.

1010
00:58:00.073 --> 00:58:01.881
- Emmett, I'll dance with him.
- Boys, keep the blacksmith company...

1011
00:58:01.906 --> 00:58:04.183
while I get acquainted with the filly.

1012
00:58:06.128 --> 00:58:07.354
Yeah.

1013
00:58:07.394 --> 00:58:08.511
Oh.

1014
00:58:09.792 --> 00:58:13.159
I don't dance very well when
my partner has a gun in his hand.

1015
00:58:13.208 --> 00:58:14.597
Oh, you'll learn.

1016
00:58:14.706 --> 00:58:15.917
You'll learn!

1017
00:58:15.948 --> 00:58:17.034
You know, smithy?

1018
00:58:17.066 --> 00:58:19.285
Maybe, I'll just take
my $80 worth out of her!

1019
00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.097
Tannen, leave her alone!

1020
00:58:21.936 --> 00:58:23.645
Woo!

1021
00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:25.198
Yeah.

1022
00:58:25.253 --> 00:58:28.550
I bet there's something
you can do that's worth $80.

1023
00:58:28.909 --> 00:58:31.433
I believe you've
underestimated me, mister.

1024
00:58:31.487 --> 00:58:33.456
Well, have I now?

1025
00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:36.058
Ah! Ow!

1026
00:58:36.871 --> 00:58:38.292
Ow!

1027
00:58:39.476 --> 00:58:41.698
Tannen, stop it!

1028
00:58:41.777 --> 00:58:43.331
Damn you, Tannen!

1029
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:44.620
No.

1030
00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:46.581
I damn you.

1031
00:58:47.405 --> 00:58:50.749
I damn you to hell!

1032
00:58:56.359 --> 00:58:57.633
You!

1033
00:58:57.668 --> 00:58:59.969
Hey, lighten up, jerk!

1034
00:59:03.125 --> 00:59:05.461
Mighty strong words, runt!

1035
00:59:05.562 --> 00:59:09.226
You man enough to back them up
with more than just a pie plate?

1036
00:59:11.639 --> 00:59:14.392
Look, just leave my friends alone.

1037
00:59:14.704 --> 00:59:17.337
What's wrong, dude?
You yellow?

1038
00:59:24.792 --> 00:59:26.689
That's what I thought.

1039
00:59:26.744 --> 00:59:28.424
A yellow belly.

1040
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:35.344
Nobody...

1041
00:59:35.399 --> 00:59:37.157
calls me yellow.

1042
00:59:37.451 --> 00:59:40.124
Let's finish it right now.

1043
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:43.359
Uh, not now, Buford.
Marshal's got our guns.

1044
00:59:43.556 --> 00:59:45.681
Like I said,
we'll finish this tomorrow!

1045
00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.995
Tomorrow we're robbing
the Pine City stage.

1046
00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:51.503
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?

1047
00:59:51.738 --> 00:59:53.839
No, Monday be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.

1048
00:59:53.866 --> 00:59:55.995
I'll be back this way on Monday.

1049
00:59:56.057 --> 00:59:57.641
We'll settle this then.

1050
00:59:57.704 --> 01:00:00.519
Right there out in the street,

1051
01:00:00.602 --> 01:00:02.738
in front of the Palace Saloon.

1052
01:00:03.564 --> 01:00:05.636
Yeah, right. When?

1053
01:00:05.684 --> 01:00:07.847
- High noon?
- Noon?

1054
01:00:08.027 --> 01:00:10.269
I do my killing before breakfast.

1055
01:00:10.363 --> 01:00:12.504
7 o'clock!

1056
01:00:14.354 --> 01:00:15.988
8 o'clock.

1057
01:00:16.871 --> 01:00:19.081
I do my killing after breakfast.

1058
01:00:19.117 --> 01:00:20.691
Marty!

1059
01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:27.581
All right, now, break it up.
What's all this about?

1060
01:00:27.606 --> 01:00:30.012
You causing trouble here, Tannen?

1061
01:00:30.221 --> 01:00:32.198
No trouble, Marshal.

1062
01:00:32.348 --> 01:00:35.854
Just a little personal matter
between me and Eastwood.

1063
01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.416
This don't concern the law.

1064
01:00:37.441 --> 01:00:40.404
Tonight, everything concerns the law.
Now, break it up.

1065
01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:43.872
Any brawling,
it's 15 days in the county jail.

1066
01:00:43.919 --> 01:00:46.247
All right, folks, come on.
This is a party.

1067
01:00:46.288 --> 01:00:48.653
Come on, let's have some fun!

1068
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.532
Eight o'clock Monday, runt.

1069
01:00:55.767 --> 01:00:57.212
If you ain't here,

1070
01:00:57.251 --> 01:01:00.962
I'll hunt you and shoot
you down like a duck.

1071
01:01:01.165 --> 01:01:04.259
It's "dog", Buford.
Shoot him down like a dog.

1072
01:01:04.571 --> 01:01:06.790
Let's go, boys!

1073
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.720
Let these sissies have their party!

1074
01:01:10.353 --> 01:01:12.863
Marty, what are you doing,
saying you're gonna meet Tannen?

1075
01:01:12.888 --> 01:01:14.931
Hey, Doc, Doc,
don't worry about it.

1076
01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:17.507
Monday morning 8 AM,
we're gonna be gone, right?

1077
01:01:17.532 --> 01:01:20.410
Theoretically, yes.
But, what if the train's late?

1078
01:01:20.503 --> 01:01:22.019
- Late?
- We'll discuss this later.

1079
01:01:22.044 --> 01:01:23.182
No, we'll discuss it now.
Late? What do you mean?

1080
01:01:23.207 --> 01:01:24.689
Thank you for your gallantry,
Mr. Eastwood.

1081
01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:25.899
Oh, hey, ma'am.

1082
01:01:25.935 --> 01:01:28.311
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.

1083
01:01:28.348 --> 01:01:31.210
Marty, uh, Clint,
I'm gonna take Clara home.

1084
01:01:31.235 --> 01:01:33.867
- Good night, Doc. Good night, Clara.
- You sure set him straight, Mr. Eastwood.

1085
01:01:33.892 --> 01:01:35.656
I'm glad somebody finally
got the gumption...

1086
01:01:35.687 --> 01:01:37.052
to stand up to that son of a bitch.

1087
01:01:37.077 --> 01:01:38.912
You're all right in my book,
Mr. Eastwood.

1088
01:01:38.937 --> 01:01:41.210
- I'd like to buy you a drink.
- Hey, listen, I don't want a drink.

1089
01:01:41.235 --> 01:01:42.406
- Young man. Young man!
- You don't have to buy me anything.

1090
01:01:42.431 --> 01:01:43.593
It was no big deal. I--

1091
01:01:43.618 --> 01:01:46.601
I'd like for you to have this brand new
Colt Peacemaker and gun belt.

1092
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.062
Free of charge.

1093
01:01:49.347 --> 01:01:50.431
Free?

1094
01:01:50.562 --> 01:01:52.130
I want everybody to know...

1095
01:01:52.155 --> 01:01:54.052
that the gun that shot
Buford Tannen...

1096
01:01:54.084 --> 01:01:55.785
was a Colt Peacemaker!

1097
01:01:55.810 --> 01:01:58.396
Hey, hey, no problem.
Thanks a lot.

1098
01:01:58.607 --> 01:02:00.201
Of course, son,
you understand,

1099
01:02:00.226 --> 01:02:03.076
if you lose,
I'm taking it back.

1100
01:02:05.886 --> 01:02:07.584
Thanks again.

1101
01:02:10.667 --> 01:02:12.410
You had him, Mr. Eastwood.

1102
01:02:12.435 --> 01:02:13.566
You could have just walked away...

1103
01:02:13.591 --> 01:02:15.886
and nobody would have thought
the less of you for it.

1104
01:02:15.933 --> 01:02:19.669
All it would have been was words,
hot air from a buffoon.

1105
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.841
Instead, you let him rile you.

1106
01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.935
Rile you into playing his game,

1107
01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.029
his way, by his rules.

1108
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:28.380
Seamus, relax.
I know what I'm doing.

1109
01:02:28.482 --> 01:02:30.583
- He reminds me of poor Martin.
- Aye.

1110
01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:31.794
- Who?
- Me brother.

1111
01:02:31.819 --> 01:02:33.007
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1112
01:02:33.032 --> 01:02:35.154
You have a brother named Martin McFly?

1113
01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:36.904
Had a brother.

1114
01:02:37.537 --> 01:02:40.302
Martin used to let men
provoke him into fighting.

1115
01:02:40.412 --> 01:02:43.357
He was concerned that people would
think him a coward if he refused.

1116
01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:45.826
That's how he got a Bowie
knife shoved through his belly,

1117
01:02:45.851 --> 01:02:48.333
in a saloon in Virginia City.

1118
01:02:48.771 --> 01:02:50.700
Never considered the future,
poor Martin.

1119
01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.755
God rest his soul.

1120
01:02:54.168 --> 01:02:57.691
Sure, and I hope you're considering
the future, Mr. Eastwood.

1121
01:03:01.202 --> 01:03:03.611
I think about it all the time.

1122
01:03:04.588 --> 01:03:06.299
And that crater
in the middle north west,

1123
01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.938
the one that's out there
all by itself like a starburst?

1124
01:03:08.963 --> 01:03:11.978
- Uh-huh.
- That one's called Copernicus.

1125
01:03:12.759 --> 01:03:15.463
Listen to me. I feel like
I'm teaching school.

1126
01:03:15.494 --> 01:03:18.361
No, no, no.
Please, continue the lesson.

1127
01:03:18.871 --> 01:03:21.916
I never found
lunar geography so fascinating.

1128
01:03:22.005 --> 01:03:24.049
You're quite knowledgeable.

1129
01:03:24.166 --> 01:03:25.986
When I was eleven,
I had diphtheria.

1130
01:03:26.011 --> 01:03:28.095
I was quarantined for three months.

1131
01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:31.822
So, my father brought this telescope
and he put it next to my bed,

1132
01:03:31.853 --> 01:03:34.252
so I could see everything
out the window.

1133
01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:37.638
Emmett, do you think
we'll ever be able to...

1134
01:03:37.677 --> 01:03:41.997
travel to the moon the way
we travel across the country on trains?

1135
01:03:42.022 --> 01:03:43.028
Definitely.

1136
01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:45.514
Although not for another
84 years and not on trains.

1137
01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:49.420
We'll have space vehicles,
capsules sent aloft with rockets.

1138
01:03:49.506 --> 01:03:51.576
Devices that create giant explosions.

1139
01:03:51.601 --> 01:03:53.926
Explosions so powerful
that they just--

1140
01:03:53.951 --> 01:03:56.201
They break the pull
of the Earth's gravity...

1141
01:03:56.231 --> 01:03:59.256
and send the projectile
through outer space.

1142
01:04:00.701 --> 01:04:03.467
Emmett, I read that book too!

1143
01:04:03.546 --> 01:04:05.365
You, you're quoting Jules Verne,

1144
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:06.756
"From the Earth to the Moon".

1145
01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.436
You've read Jules Verne?

1146
01:04:09.725 --> 01:04:13.279
- I adore Jules Verne.
- So do I.

1147
01:04:13.443 --> 01:04:16.547
"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea",
my absolute favorite.

1148
01:04:16.572 --> 01:04:18.709
The first time I read that
when I was a little boy.

1149
01:04:18.742 --> 01:04:21.039
Why, I wanted to meet Captain Nemo.

1150
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.156
Don't tease, Emmett.

1151
01:04:22.181 --> 01:04:24.553
You, you couldn't have read that
when you were a boy.

1152
01:04:24.578 --> 01:04:27.054
It was only first
published 10 years ago.

1153
01:04:27.079 --> 01:04:29.383
Oh, yes.
Well, I meant...

1154
01:04:29.438 --> 01:04:31.867
it made me feel like a boy.

1155
01:04:33.242 --> 01:04:37.992
I never met a woman
who liked Jules Verne before.

1156
01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:43.562
I never ever met a man like you before.

1157
01:05:35.572 --> 01:05:37.055
Doc?

1158
01:05:41.412 --> 01:05:42.885
Doc?

1159
01:05:45.744 --> 01:05:48.151
Hope you know what you're doing.

1160
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.141
You talking to me?

1161
01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:08.275
You talking to me, Tannen?

1162
01:06:11.824 --> 01:06:13.861
Well, I'm the only one here.

1163
01:06:14.582 --> 01:06:16.252
Go ahead!

1164
01:06:16.393 --> 01:06:18.064
Make my day.

1165
01:06:24.717 --> 01:06:26.358
Say, good morning, Mr. Eastwood.

1166
01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:27.675
Good morning.

1167
01:06:27.714 --> 01:06:29.366
Have a cigar, Mr. Eastwood.

1168
01:06:29.407 --> 01:06:31.909
Anything I can do for you today,
Mr. Eastwood?

1169
01:06:31.952 --> 01:06:33.669
No, that's fine, Adam.

1170
01:06:33.694 --> 01:06:35.241
Good luck tomorrow, Mr. Eastwood.

1171
01:06:35.272 --> 01:06:37.046
We'll be praying for you.

1172
01:06:37.217 --> 01:06:38.686
Thanks.

1173
01:06:39.210 --> 01:06:41.217
Good morning, Mr. Eastwood.

1174
01:06:41.326 --> 01:06:44.092
Interest you in a new suit
for tomorrow?

1175
01:06:44.421 --> 01:06:45.507
Uh...

1176
01:06:45.532 --> 01:06:47.038
I'm, I'm fine.

1177
01:06:47.084 --> 01:06:48.444
Thanks.

1178
01:06:58.519 --> 01:06:59.761
Doc.

1179
01:06:59.862 --> 01:07:02.120
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

1180
01:07:02.214 --> 01:07:04.636
I was just out enjoying the morning air.

1181
01:07:04.696 --> 01:07:06.433
It's really lovely here
in the morning.

1182
01:07:06.472 --> 01:07:08.396
- Don't you think?
- Yeah, it's lovely, Doc.

1183
01:07:08.421 --> 01:07:09.772
Listen, we've got to load
the DeLorean up,

1184
01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:11.394
and get ready to roll, all right?

1185
01:07:11.423 --> 01:07:14.519
Hey, look at that,
the tombstone.

1186
01:07:15.643 --> 01:07:18.409
Marty, let me see
that photograph again.

1187
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:22.987
My name, it's vanished.

1188
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:24.870
Hey, that's great, Doc.

1189
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.860
Don't you get it? We're going
back to the future tomorrow.

1190
01:07:26.885 --> 01:07:28.159
So, everything's being erased.

1191
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:29.932
But, only my name is erased.

1192
01:07:29.957 --> 01:07:31.871
The tombstone itself
and the date still remain.

1193
01:07:31.896 --> 01:07:33.813
That doesn't make sense.

1194
01:07:33.964 --> 01:07:36.581
We know that this photograph
represents what will happen...

1195
01:07:36.606 --> 01:07:38.150
if the events of today continue...

1196
01:07:38.175 --> 01:07:39.925
to run their course into tomorrow.

1197
01:07:39.956 --> 01:07:42.229
- Right. So?
- Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood.

1198
01:07:42.276 --> 01:07:43.940
I just need to take
your measurements.

1199
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:46.409
Oh, look, pal,
I don't want to buy a suit.

1200
01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:49.182
No, this is for your coffin.

1201
01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:50.464
My coffin?

1202
01:07:50.489 --> 01:07:52.971
Well, the odds are running
2-to-1 against you.

1203
01:07:53.055 --> 01:07:55.190
Might as well be prepared.

1204
01:07:55.284 --> 01:07:59.010
So, it may not be my name that's
supposed to end up on this tombstone.

1205
01:07:59.053 --> 01:08:01.214
It may be yours.

1206
01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.917
- Great Scott!

1207
01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:04.581
I know. This is heavy.

1208
01:08:04.628 --> 01:08:06.120
Marty, why are you
wearing that gun?

1209
01:08:06.145 --> 01:08:08.417
You're not considering going up
against Tannen tomorrow?

1210
01:08:08.442 --> 01:08:11.190
Doc, tomorrow morning,
I'm going back to the future with you.

1211
01:08:11.229 --> 01:08:13.135
But, if Buford Tannen
comes looking for trouble,

1212
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.635
I'm gonna be ready for him.

1213
01:08:14.667 --> 01:08:17.135
You heard what that son
of a bitch called me last night.

1214
01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.518
Marty, you can't go
losing your judgment...

1215
01:08:18.557 --> 01:08:19.948
every time someone calls you a name.

1216
01:08:19.987 --> 01:08:23.432
That's exactly what causes you
to get into that accident in the future.

1217
01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:26.731
What?

1218
01:08:27.388 --> 01:08:29.254
What about my future?

1219
01:08:29.531 --> 01:08:30.864
I can't tell you.

1220
01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:32.887
It might make things worse.

1221
01:08:32.945 --> 01:08:34.454
Wait a minute, Doc.

1222
01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.306
What is wrong with my future?

1223
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:39.797
Marty, we all have to make decisions...

1224
01:08:39.822 --> 01:08:42.181
that affect the course of our lives.

1225
01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:45.017
You've got to do
what you've got to do.

1226
01:08:45.095 --> 01:08:47.775
And I've got to do
what I've got to do.

1227
01:08:58.559 --> 01:09:00.334
- Marty.
- Yeah?

1228
01:09:00.551 --> 01:09:02.519
- I've made a decision.
- Uh-huh.

1229
01:09:02.544 --> 01:09:04.678
I'm not going with you tomorrow.

1230
01:09:04.771 --> 01:09:06.646
I'm staying here.

1231
01:09:09.856 --> 01:09:12.434
What are you talking about, Doc?

1232
01:09:12.575 --> 01:09:14.614
There's no point in denying it.

1233
01:09:14.677 --> 01:09:17.130
- I'm in love with Clara.
- Oh, man.

1234
01:09:17.255 --> 01:09:19.559
Doc, we don't belong here.

1235
01:09:19.724 --> 01:09:21.388
Neither one of us.

1236
01:09:21.514 --> 01:09:24.302
You know, it could still be you
that gets shot tomorrow.

1237
01:09:24.403 --> 01:09:27.113
This tombstone could
still be in your future.

1238
01:09:27.143 --> 01:09:28.497
Marty.

1239
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:30.442
The future isn't written.

1240
01:09:30.504 --> 01:09:32.763
It can be changed.
You know that.

1241
01:09:34.147 --> 01:09:37.825
Anyone can make their future
whatever they want it to be.

1242
01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:42.317
I can't let this one little photograph
determine my entire destiny.

1243
01:09:42.497 --> 01:09:43.856
I have to live my life...

1244
01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:46.294
according to what
I believe is right,

1245
01:09:46.544 --> 01:09:48.349
in my heart.

1246
01:09:49.997 --> 01:09:51.437
Doc.

1247
01:09:51.797 --> 01:09:53.773
You're a scientist.

1248
01:09:54.819 --> 01:09:56.429
So, you tell me,

1249
01:09:56.531 --> 01:09:58.367
what's the right thing to do...

1250
01:09:58.422 --> 01:10:00.117
up here?

1251
01:10:13.192 --> 01:10:14.718
You're right, Marty.

1252
01:10:37.479 --> 01:10:38.797
Wow, that worked great.

1253
01:10:38.838 --> 01:10:41.625
I've, at least, got to tell her goodbye.

1254
01:10:42.603 --> 01:10:44.109
Come on, Doc.

1255
01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:47.031
Think about it.
What are you gonna say to her?

1256
01:10:47.062 --> 01:10:49.375
"I've got to go back to the future?"
I mean,

1257
01:10:49.492 --> 01:10:50.949
she's not gonna
understand that, Doc.

1258
01:10:50.976 --> 01:10:53.797
Hell, I'm in it with you and
I don't even understand it.

1259
01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:58.322
Doc.

1260
01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:00.198
Listen.

1261
01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:02.752
Maybe, we...

1262
01:11:03.038 --> 01:11:05.853
I don't know, maybe,
we can just take Clara with us.

1263
01:11:07.478 --> 01:11:08.955
To the future?

1264
01:11:13.021 --> 01:11:15.153
As you reminded me, Marty.

1265
01:11:15.274 --> 01:11:18.433
I'm a scientist, so I must
be scientific about this.

1266
01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.855
I cautioned you about
disrupting the continuum...

1267
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.121
for your own personal benefit.

1268
01:11:22.146 --> 01:11:24.136
Therefore, I must do no less.

1269
01:11:24.418 --> 01:11:25.629
We shall proceed as planned,

1270
01:11:25.654 --> 01:11:27.808
and as soon as we return to 1985,

1271
01:11:27.846 --> 01:11:30.598
we'll destroy this infernal machine.

1272
01:11:31.278 --> 01:11:34.497
Traveling through time
has become much too painful.

1273
01:12:05.117 --> 01:12:07.028
It's Emmett, Clara.

1274
01:12:09.547 --> 01:12:10.781
Oh.

1275
01:12:10.966 --> 01:12:12.265
Emmett.

1276
01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.077
Won't you come in?

1277
01:12:14.171 --> 01:12:15.882
No, I better not.

1278
01:12:16.172 --> 01:12:17.601
I...

1279
01:12:19.179 --> 01:12:20.781
What's wrong?

1280
01:12:21.968 --> 01:12:24.132
I've come to say goodbye.

1281
01:12:25.315 --> 01:12:26.487
Goodbye?

1282
01:12:26.535 --> 01:12:28.324
Well, where are you going?

1283
01:12:28.489 --> 01:12:30.315
I'm going away.

1284
01:12:30.762 --> 01:12:33.769
And well, I'm afraid
I'll never see you again.

1285
01:12:34.543 --> 01:12:35.909
Emmett!

1286
01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:37.417
Clara.

1287
01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:41.980
I want you to know that
I care about you deeply.

1288
01:12:42.261 --> 01:12:44.167
But, I've realized that
I don't belong here.

1289
01:12:44.204 --> 01:12:46.839
And I have to go back
where I came from.

1290
01:12:47.756 --> 01:12:49.948
And where might that be?

1291
01:12:50.508 --> 01:12:52.362
I can't tell you.

1292
01:12:54.483 --> 01:12:55.808
Well,

1293
01:12:56.066 --> 01:12:58.800
wherever you're going,
take me with you.

1294
01:12:59.563 --> 01:13:01.448
I can't, Clara.

1295
01:13:01.972 --> 01:13:03.509
I wish it didn't have to be this way.

1296
01:13:03.534 --> 01:13:06.730
But, just believe me when I tell you
that I'll never forget you.

1297
01:13:06.776 --> 01:13:08.081
And that...

1298
01:13:08.371 --> 01:13:10.074
I love you.

1299
01:13:11.535 --> 01:13:13.817
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

1300
01:13:13.903 --> 01:13:15.237
Clara.

1301
01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:18.222
I don't think there's any way
that you can understand it.

1302
01:13:18.368 --> 01:13:20.886
Please, Emmett.
Please, I have to know.

1303
01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:24.597
If, if you sincerely do love me,
then tell me the truth.

1304
01:13:26.038 --> 01:13:27.551
All right, then.

1305
01:13:28.715 --> 01:13:30.934
I'm from the future.

1306
01:13:31.942 --> 01:13:34.973
I came here in a time machine
that I invented.

1307
01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:39.887
And tomorrow, I have
to go back to the year 1985.

1308
01:13:45.457 --> 01:13:46.861
Yes, Emmett.

1309
01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.037
I do understand.

1310
01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.947
I understand that because you know...

1311
01:13:54.986 --> 01:13:57.229
I'm partial to the writings
of Jules Verne,

1312
01:13:57.254 --> 01:13:58.851
you concocted those mendacities...

1313
01:13:58.876 --> 01:14:01.533
in order to take advantage of me.

1314
01:14:01.799 --> 01:14:04.408
Oh, I've heard some
whoppers in my day,

1315
01:14:04.433 --> 01:14:07.841
but the fact that you'd expect me
to entertain a notion like that is so...

1316
01:14:07.884 --> 01:14:10.306
insulting and degrading!

1317
01:14:11.325 --> 01:14:12.599
All you had to say is,

1318
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:15.558
"I don't love you and
I don't want to see you anymore."

1319
01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:17.888
That, at least,
would have been respectful!

1320
01:14:18.779 --> 01:14:20.732
But, that's not the truth.

1321
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:58.059
Come on, right over here, friend.

1322
01:15:02.934 --> 01:15:04.379
Emmett!

1323
01:15:04.535 --> 01:15:06.418
What can I get you?
The usual?

1324
01:15:06.457 --> 01:15:10.168
No, Chester, I'm gonna need something
a lot stronger than that tonight.

1325
01:15:10.277 --> 01:15:11.801
Sarsaparilla.

1326
01:15:11.848 --> 01:15:13.606
Whiskey, Chester.

1327
01:15:14.059 --> 01:15:15.379
Whiskey?

1328
01:15:15.567 --> 01:15:16.713
Emmett, are you sure?

1329
01:15:16.738 --> 01:15:19.074
You know what happened to you
on the Fourth of July.

1330
01:15:19.103 --> 01:15:20.699
Whiskey.

1331
01:15:21.625 --> 01:15:24.590
Okay, I ain't your papa.

1332
01:15:24.793 --> 01:15:26.707
Just don't want to see you...

1333
01:15:26.801 --> 01:15:28.879
do the wrong thing.

1334
01:15:29.285 --> 01:15:31.762
You need to leave the bottle.

1335
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:35.582
It's a woman, right?

1336
01:15:36.738 --> 01:15:38.426
I knew it.
I have seen that look...

1337
01:15:38.459 --> 01:15:41.918
on a man's face a thousand times,
all across the country.

1338
01:15:42.082 --> 01:15:44.561
All I can tell you, friend,
is you'll get over her.

1339
01:15:44.593 --> 01:15:45.795
Oh.

1340
01:15:45.866 --> 01:15:48.764
Clara was one in a million.

1341
01:15:49.028 --> 01:15:51.014
One in a billion.

1342
01:15:51.233 --> 01:15:53.311
One in a googolplex.

1343
01:15:53.373 --> 01:15:56.898
The woman of my dreams
and I've lost her for all time.

1344
01:15:56.961 --> 01:15:58.245
Um...

1345
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:01.621
I can assure you sir,
there are other women.

1346
01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.426
I've peddling this barbed wire
all across the country...

1347
01:16:04.465 --> 01:16:06.699
has taught me one thing for certain,

1348
01:16:06.871 --> 01:16:09.098
is that you never know
what the future might bring.

1349
01:16:09.129 --> 01:16:10.652
Oh, the future.

1350
01:16:10.676 --> 01:16:14.520
Oh, I can tell you about the future.

1351
01:16:24.387 --> 01:16:26.540
Oh, man, did I sleep.

1352
01:16:29.421 --> 01:16:31.479
What time is it, Doc?

1353
01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:36.721
Doc?

1354
01:16:47.475 --> 01:16:49.655
Wake up!

1355
01:16:50.932 --> 01:16:53.108
- Get up! Let's go.
- Yes, Boss.

1356
01:16:53.833 --> 01:16:55.796
I got me a runt to kill.

1357
01:16:55.929 --> 01:16:57.686
It's still early, Boss.

1358
01:16:57.796 --> 01:16:59.460
What's your hurry?

1359
01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:01.343
I'm hungry.

1360
01:17:01.973 --> 01:17:03.264
In the future,

1361
01:17:03.312 --> 01:17:05.749
we don't need horses.

1362
01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:10.335
We have motorized carriages
called automobiles.

1363
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:14.757
If everybody's got
one of these auto whatsits,

1364
01:17:14.788 --> 01:17:17.819
does anybody walk or run anymore?

1365
01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:19.233
Of course, we run.

1366
01:17:19.624 --> 01:17:21.882
But, for recreation, for fun.

1367
01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:23.452
Run for fun?

1368
01:17:23.507 --> 01:17:26.561
What the hell kind of fun is that?

1369
01:17:35.853 --> 01:17:37.116
Doc!

1370
01:17:37.491 --> 01:17:38.725
Doc!

1371
01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:46.660
How much has he had?

1372
01:17:46.761 --> 01:17:48.454
None! That's the first one...

1373
01:17:48.479 --> 01:17:50.313
and he hasn't touched it yet.

1374
01:17:50.889 --> 01:17:52.485
He just likes to hold it.

1375
01:17:55.983 --> 01:17:57.808
Doc! Doc!

1376
01:17:58.074 --> 01:17:59.738
What are you doing?

1377
01:17:59.969 --> 01:18:01.636
I've lost her, Marty.

1378
01:18:01.715 --> 01:18:03.285
There's nothing left for me here.

1379
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:05.292
All right, that's why
you gotta come back with me.

1380
01:18:05.324 --> 01:18:08.277
- Where?
- Back to the future!

1381
01:18:11.835 --> 01:18:14.866
- Right. Let's get going!
- Great.

1382
01:18:15.053 --> 01:18:16.131
Gentlemen, excuse me.

1383
01:18:16.155 --> 01:18:18.366
But, my friend and I
have to catch a train.

1384
01:18:18.424 --> 01:18:20.124
Here's to you, blacksmith.

1385
01:18:20.155 --> 01:18:21.600
And to the future.

1386
01:18:21.639 --> 01:18:22.896
Amen.

1387
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:24.038
Amen.

1388
01:18:24.069 --> 01:18:25.765
Emmett, no!

1389
01:18:32.786 --> 01:18:34.394
Doc! Doc!

1390
01:18:34.768 --> 01:18:36.144
Doc!

1391
01:18:36.612 --> 01:18:38.433
Come on, Doc.
Wake up.

1392
01:18:38.488 --> 01:18:39.996
Wake up, Doc!

1393
01:18:40.644 --> 01:18:41.808
How many did he have?

1394
01:18:41.868 --> 01:18:43.073
Just the one.

1395
01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.222
Just the one?

1396
01:18:44.254 --> 01:18:45.394
Come on, Doc.

1397
01:18:45.427 --> 01:18:47.519
There's a fellow
that can't hold his liquor.

1398
01:18:47.546 --> 01:18:48.691
Get me some coffee.

1399
01:18:48.730 --> 01:18:50.558
- Black.
- Joey, coffee!

1400
01:19:00.478 --> 01:19:01.927
Ma'am?

1401
01:19:02.372 --> 01:19:04.575
How far does the 8 o'clock train go?

1402
01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.204
San Francisco is the end of the line.

1403
01:19:08.495 --> 01:19:10.633
I'll take a one-way ticket.

1404
01:19:12.055 --> 01:19:14.087
You want to sober
him up in a hurry son,

1405
01:19:14.111 --> 01:19:16.243
you're gonna have to use something
a lot stronger than coffee.

1406
01:19:16.273 --> 01:19:18.317
Yeah, what do you suggest?

1407
01:19:18.918 --> 01:19:20.313
Joey!

1408
01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:22.384
Let's make some wake-up juice.

1409
01:19:29.856 --> 01:19:31.842
In about ten minutes,

1410
01:19:32.007 --> 01:19:35.858
he's gonna be as sober
as a priest on Sunday.

1411
01:19:36.119 --> 01:19:37.319
Ten minutes?

1412
01:19:37.344 --> 01:19:39.850
Why do we have to cut
these things so damn close?

1413
01:19:39.889 --> 01:19:42.842
Here, stick this clothespin on his nose.

1414
01:19:44.327 --> 01:19:46.499
And when he opens up his mouth,

1415
01:19:46.559 --> 01:19:49.663
go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.

1416
01:19:49.905 --> 01:19:52.217
Oh, and stand back.

1417
01:20:10.226 --> 01:20:11.312
He's still out!

1418
01:20:11.351 --> 01:20:13.666
Oh, that?
That was just a reflex action.

1419
01:20:13.691 --> 01:20:15.734
It's gonna take a few
more minutes for the stuff...

1420
01:20:15.759 --> 01:20:17.219
to really clear up his head.

1421
01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:18.726
Perfect.

1422
01:20:39.584 --> 01:20:41.821
Come on, Doc.
Come on, wake up, buddy.

1423
01:20:41.846 --> 01:20:43.321
Wake up, Doc.
Come on.

1424
01:20:43.361 --> 01:20:44.611
Come on.

1425
01:20:44.664 --> 01:20:47.493
Seamus, wouldn't expect
to see you here this morning.

1426
01:20:47.534 --> 01:20:48.790
Aye.

1427
01:20:48.837 --> 01:20:51.900
Well, something inside me
told me I should be here.

1428
01:20:52.294 --> 01:20:55.429
As if my future had
something to do with it.

1429
01:20:57.181 --> 01:20:59.048
He'll come around in a minute.

1430
01:20:59.082 --> 01:21:00.899
- Come on.
- Come on, Doc.

1431
01:21:00.938 --> 01:21:02.954
Let's go, Doc.
Let's wake up now, buddy.

1432
01:21:03.001 --> 01:21:04.501
Come on.

1433
01:21:10.775 --> 01:21:13.268
Are you in there, Eastwood?

1434
01:21:14.996 --> 01:21:16.603
It's eight o'clock.

1435
01:21:16.689 --> 01:21:19.056
And I'm calling you out.

1436
01:21:23.068 --> 01:21:25.084
It's not eight o'clock yet.

1437
01:21:25.139 --> 01:21:27.108
It is by my watch.

1438
01:21:27.162 --> 01:21:30.436
Let's settle this
once and for all, runt!

1439
01:21:31.615 --> 01:21:34.115
Or ain't you got the gumption?

1440
01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.972
Listen.

1441
01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:50.110
I'm not really feeling up to this today.

1442
01:21:51.595 --> 01:21:53.735
So, I'm gonna have to forfeit.

1443
01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:54.884
For...

1444
01:21:54.923 --> 01:21:56.540
Forfeit?

1445
01:21:57.032 --> 01:21:58.813
What's that mean?

1446
01:21:58.974 --> 01:22:01.919
Um, it means that
you win without a fight.

1447
01:22:01.974 --> 01:22:03.302
Without shooting?

1448
01:22:03.349 --> 01:22:05.989
He can't do that.
Hey, you can't do that!

1449
01:22:06.114 --> 01:22:07.778
You know what I think?

1450
01:22:07.888 --> 01:22:11.216
I think you ain't nothing
but a gutless yellow turd!

1451
01:22:11.403 --> 01:22:13.536
And I'm giving you
to the count of 10...

1452
01:22:13.583 --> 01:22:16.380
to come out here
and prove I'm wrong.

1453
01:22:16.622 --> 01:22:17.849
One!

1454
01:22:17.874 --> 01:22:20.552
Doc, come on.
Sober up, buddy.

1455
01:22:20.577 --> 01:22:21.849
- Let's go. Come on.
- Two!

1456
01:22:21.874 --> 01:22:23.255
You better get out there, son.

1457
01:22:23.283 --> 01:22:25.107
I got twenty dollar gold
bet on you,

1458
01:22:25.138 --> 01:22:26.552
so don't let me down.

1459
01:22:26.577 --> 01:22:27.614
Three!

1460
01:22:27.639 --> 01:22:29.942
I got thirty dollar gold
bet against you,

1461
01:22:29.966 --> 01:22:31.912
so don't let me down.

1462
01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:32.989
Four!

1463
01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:35.075
You better face up to it, son,

1464
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.677
because if you don't go out there...

1465
01:22:37.702 --> 01:22:39.685
- What?
- Five!

1466
01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:42.221
What if I don't go out there?

1467
01:22:42.255 --> 01:22:43.591
You're a coward.

1468
01:22:43.635 --> 01:22:44.718
Six!

1469
01:22:44.756 --> 01:22:47.888
And you'll be branded a coward
for the rest of your days!

1470
01:22:47.934 --> 01:22:49.911
Everybody everywhere...

1471
01:22:49.974 --> 01:22:52.185
will say Clint Eastwood...

1472
01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:55.833
is the biggest yellow belly in the West.

1473
01:23:00.034 --> 01:23:01.752
Seven!

1474
01:23:02.127 --> 01:23:03.573
Here.

1475
01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:08.987
Eight!

1476
01:23:17.337 --> 01:23:19.251
I already got a gun.

1477
01:23:20.586 --> 01:23:22.352
Nine!

1478
01:23:26.858 --> 01:23:28.194
Ten!

1479
01:23:32.894 --> 01:23:34.577
Do you hear me, runt?

1480
01:23:34.682 --> 01:23:39.515
I said that's ten,
you gutless yellow pie-slinger.

1481
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.503
He's an asshole.

1482
01:23:44.917 --> 01:23:46.854
I don't care what Tannen says.

1483
01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:49.823
And I don't care what
anybody else says either.

1484
01:23:51.135 --> 01:23:52.737
Doc! Doc, you okay?

1485
01:23:52.762 --> 01:23:54.550
I think so. Whoa!

1486
01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.175
What a headache!

1487
01:23:56.237 --> 01:23:58.300
Listen, you got
a back door to this place?

1488
01:23:58.354 --> 01:23:59.464
Yeah, it's in the back.

1489
01:23:59.489 --> 01:24:00.518
Let's go, Doc.

1490
01:24:00.546 --> 01:24:04.229
Are you coming out here,
or do I have to come in after you?

1491
01:24:05.675 --> 01:24:08.300
The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.

1492
01:24:08.638 --> 01:24:09.878
Hey!

1493
01:24:15.743 --> 01:24:17.523
Reach, blacksmith!

1494
01:24:34.253 --> 01:24:35.323
Yes, sir.

1495
01:24:35.402 --> 01:24:39.149
That poor fellow, last night, had
the worst case of broken heart...

1496
01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:40.768
I have ever seen.

1497
01:24:41.042 --> 01:24:42.432
When he said he didn't know

1498
01:24:42.457 --> 01:24:44.175
how he could live the rest of his life

1499
01:24:44.215 --> 01:24:46.932
knowing how much hurt
he'd caused that little girl.

1500
01:24:47.019 --> 01:24:48.409
Well,

1501
01:24:48.729 --> 01:24:49.972
I really felt for him.

1502
01:24:50.011 --> 01:24:51.831
I did. Right here.

1503
01:24:55.858 --> 01:24:57.627
Listen up, Eastwood.

1504
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.353
I aim to shoot somebody today,

1505
01:24:59.378 --> 01:25:01.096
and I prefer it'd be you.

1506
01:25:01.175 --> 01:25:03.642
But, if you're just too damn yellow.

1507
01:25:03.939 --> 01:25:06.220
I guess, it'll just have to be
your blacksmith friend.

1508
01:25:06.330 --> 01:25:09.478
Forget about me, Marty,
and save yourself!

1509
01:25:13.761 --> 01:25:15.887
You got one minute to decide.

1510
01:25:15.959 --> 01:25:17.160
You hear me, runt?

1511
01:25:17.185 --> 01:25:18.638
One minute!

1512
01:25:21.565 --> 01:25:24.482
I've never seen a man
so broken up over a woman.

1513
01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:25.911
What did he say her name was?

1514
01:25:25.966 --> 01:25:27.396
Cara? Sara?

1515
01:25:27.445 --> 01:25:29.185
- Clara?
- Clara!

1516
01:25:31.976 --> 01:25:34.070
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am?

1517
01:25:35.093 --> 01:25:36.921
But, was this man tall with...

1518
01:25:36.976 --> 01:25:40.827
great big brown puppy-dog eyes
and long silvery, flowing hair?

1519
01:25:41.117 --> 01:25:42.648
You know him.

1520
01:25:45.348 --> 01:25:46.674
Emmett!

1521
01:25:49.041 --> 01:25:50.620
Oh!

1522
01:26:01.113 --> 01:26:03.395
Time's up, runt!

1523
01:26:09.124 --> 01:26:11.552
Prepare to meet
your maker, blacksmith.

1524
01:26:11.984 --> 01:26:13.900
I'm right here, Tannen!

1525
01:26:51.596 --> 01:26:53.073
Draw!

1526
01:26:56.099 --> 01:26:57.350
No!

1527
01:27:12.442 --> 01:27:15.286
I thought we could settle this like men.

1528
01:27:16.688 --> 01:27:18.723
You thought wrong, dude.

1529
01:27:40.787 --> 01:27:42.012
Thank you.

1530
01:28:45.974 --> 01:28:47.582
That was good.

1531
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:52.222
- You know what I think?
- No.

1532
01:28:52.465 --> 01:28:53.894
I think Buford's going to jail.

1533
01:28:53.918 --> 01:28:55.425
You're right.

1534
01:28:56.115 --> 01:28:57.857
Oh, oh.

1535
01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:02.600
Get him out of that shit.

1536
01:29:02.663 --> 01:29:04.302
Get them!

1537
01:29:08.221 --> 01:29:09.776
Buford Tannen,

1538
01:29:09.901 --> 01:29:13.096
you're under arrest for
robbing the Pine City stage.

1539
01:29:13.141 --> 01:29:15.166
You got anything to say?

1540
01:29:20.116 --> 01:29:22.192
I hate manure.

1541
01:29:22.294 --> 01:29:23.926
Look!

1542
01:29:26.878 --> 01:29:28.511
Yes!

1543
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.863
- The train!
- Can we make it?

1544
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.582
We'll have to cut them off
at Coyote Pass.

1545
01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:37.894
Hey! Hey, mister.

1546
01:29:37.918 --> 01:29:39.214
Mr. Eastwood.

1547
01:29:39.269 --> 01:29:40.972
Here's your gun, mister.

1548
01:29:41.121 --> 01:29:42.582
Thanks, kid.

1549
01:29:46.931 --> 01:29:48.489
Seamus!

1550
01:29:49.802 --> 01:29:52.739
It's worth twelve dollars.
Never been used.

1551
01:29:53.283 --> 01:29:55.333
Maybe, I'll trade it for a new hat.

1552
01:29:55.415 --> 01:29:58.044
Right and take care of that baby.

1553
01:29:59.036 --> 01:30:00.536
I will.

1554
01:30:06.916 --> 01:30:08.185
Emmett.

1555
01:30:10.475 --> 01:30:12.639
Emmett!

1556
01:30:13.233 --> 01:30:14.975
Emmett!

1557
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:20.719
Time machine.

1558
01:30:40.403 --> 01:30:41.988
Come on.

1559
01:31:04.419 --> 01:31:06.130
Come on, Marty!

1560
01:31:09.185 --> 01:31:10.192
Go, Doc!

1561
01:31:10.224 --> 01:31:11.997
Come on, give me your hand!

1562
01:31:47.479 --> 01:31:49.354
Come on, Marty!

1563
01:31:53.462 --> 01:31:55.229
Come on, let's go!

1564
01:32:03.470 --> 01:32:05.015
Masks on.

1565
01:32:19.983 --> 01:32:21.288
Freeze!

1566
01:32:21.451 --> 01:32:23.240
This a holdup?

1567
01:32:24.446 --> 01:32:26.811
It's a science experiment.

1568
01:32:26.921 --> 01:32:30.592
Stop the train just before you hit
the switch track up ahead.

1569
01:32:45.628 --> 01:32:46.644
Doc!

1570
01:32:46.669 --> 01:32:49.425
Uncouple the cars from the tender!

1571
01:33:15.462 --> 01:33:18.105
I've wanted to do that all my life.

1572
01:33:51.449 --> 01:33:52.824
What are these things, anyway?

1573
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:54.644
My own version
of Pres-to-Logs.

1574
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:56.236
Compressed wood
with anthracite dust,

1575
01:33:56.261 --> 01:33:58.543
chemically treated
to burn hotter and longer.

1576
01:33:58.618 --> 01:34:00.965
I use them in my forge,
so I don't have to stoke it.

1577
01:34:01.027 --> 01:34:03.151
These three in the furnace
will ignite sequentially,

1578
01:34:03.179 --> 01:34:04.660
make the fire burn hotter,

1579
01:34:04.703 --> 01:34:07.754
kick up the boiler pressure,
and make the train go faster.

1580
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:21.060
Ready to roll!

1581
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:54.075
Emmett!

1582
01:34:58.538 --> 01:35:01.318
Marty, are the time circuits on?

1583
01:35:02.279 --> 01:35:03.725
Check, Doc.

1584
01:35:03.928 --> 01:35:06.038
Input the destination time.

1585
01:35:06.082 --> 01:35:10.545
October 27, 1985, 11:00 A.M.

1586
01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:12.006
Check.

1587
01:35:12.045 --> 01:35:15.405
Okay, we're cruising at a steady
25 miles an hour, Doc.

1588
01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:18.326
I'm throwing in the Pres-to-Logs.

1589
01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:29.072
Marty, the new gauge
on the dashboard...

1590
01:35:29.097 --> 01:35:30.586
will tell us the boiler temperature.

1591
01:35:30.611 --> 01:35:33.954
It's color-coded to indicate
when each log will fire.

1592
01:35:34.084 --> 01:35:36.165
Green, yellow, and red.

1593
01:35:36.368 --> 01:35:38.397
Each detonation will
be accompanied by...

1594
01:35:38.422 --> 01:35:40.884
a sudden burst of acceleration.

1595
01:35:42.055 --> 01:35:44.118
Hopefully, we'll hit
88 miles per hour...

1596
01:35:44.154 --> 01:35:46.915
before the needle gets
much past two thousand.

1597
01:35:47.024 --> 01:35:49.704
Why? What, what happens
after it hits two thousand?

1598
01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:52.094
The whole boiler explodes.

1599
01:35:52.805 --> 01:35:54.149
Perfect!

1600
01:36:09.281 --> 01:36:11.503
Hey, Doc, we just hit 35.

1601
01:36:11.548 --> 01:36:14.003
Okay, Marty.
I'm coming aboard!

1602
01:36:24.147 --> 01:36:25.689
Emmett!

1603
01:36:26.408 --> 01:36:27.900
Emmett!

1604
01:36:30.077 --> 01:36:32.194
Come on, come on.

1605
01:36:41.247 --> 01:36:42.700
You better hold on
to something, Doc.

1606
01:36:42.725 --> 01:36:45.090
The yellow log is about to blow.

1607
01:36:46.777 --> 01:36:48.292
Oh!

1608
01:36:49.705 --> 01:36:51.073
Golly!

1609
01:36:54.315 --> 01:36:56.589
We just passed 40, Doc!

1610
01:37:18.317 --> 01:37:19.707
Emmett!

1611
01:37:20.947 --> 01:37:22.872
Emmett!

1612
01:37:28.755 --> 01:37:30.201
Emmett!

1613
01:37:32.427 --> 01:37:35.278
We just passed 45, Doc.
Go for it!

1614
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:46.803
Fifty.

1615
01:37:57.688 --> 01:37:58.841
Emmett!

1616
01:37:58.889 --> 01:38:00.352
Clara!

1617
01:38:00.764 --> 01:38:02.258
I love you.

1618
01:38:04.375 --> 01:38:06.688
Doc! Doc!
What's happening?

1619
01:38:06.724 --> 01:38:08.109
It's Clara.

1620
01:38:08.196 --> 01:38:10.047
She's on the train.

1621
01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:11.430
Clara?

1622
01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:12.508
Perfect.

1623
01:38:12.543 --> 01:38:13.826
She's in the cab.

1624
01:38:13.912 --> 01:38:15.975
I'm gonna go back for her.

1625
01:38:16.037 --> 01:38:17.279
The windmill.

1626
01:38:17.361 --> 01:38:19.254
Doc! The windmill.

1627
01:38:19.279 --> 01:38:21.967
We're going past 50.
You'll never make it.

1628
01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.162
Then we'll have to
take her back with us.

1629
01:38:25.210 --> 01:38:27.608
Keep calling out the speed.

1630
01:38:27.672 --> 01:38:29.037
Clara!

1631
01:38:29.077 --> 01:38:31.139
Climb out here to me.

1632
01:38:31.199 --> 01:38:32.631
I don't know if I can.

1633
01:38:32.662 --> 01:38:34.209
You can do it.

1634
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:36.342
Just don't look down.

1635
01:38:39.898 --> 01:38:41.616
That's it.

1636
01:38:55.149 --> 01:38:57.563
Sixty miles an hour, Doc!

1637
01:39:00.088 --> 01:39:01.716
You're doing fine.

1638
01:39:01.779 --> 01:39:03.794
Nice and steady.

1639
01:39:06.492 --> 01:39:08.343
Come on!

1640
01:39:08.726 --> 01:39:10.773
Just a little further.

1641
01:39:10.858 --> 01:39:13.390
I can't, Emmett.
I'm scared.

1642
01:39:15.388 --> 01:39:16.818
Seventy!

1643
01:39:17.323 --> 01:39:19.388
Keep coming, Clara!

1644
01:39:20.252 --> 01:39:21.630
Come on!

1645
01:39:21.717 --> 01:39:24.021
Come on, you're doing fine!

1646
01:39:24.763 --> 01:39:26.693
Come on!

1647
01:39:26.967 --> 01:39:29.131
Nice and easy.

1648
01:39:29.591 --> 01:39:30.755
Don't look down.

1649
01:39:30.803 --> 01:39:32.974
That's it. You're doing fine.

1650
01:39:35.327 --> 01:39:39.876
Doc! The red log is about to blow!

1651
01:39:44.361 --> 01:39:46.290
Oh!

1652
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:48.737
Clara!

1653
01:39:48.830 --> 01:39:50.314
Clara!

1654
01:39:50.821 --> 01:39:53.181
Emmett!

1655
01:40:02.502 --> 01:40:04.318
I'm trying to reach you!

1656
01:40:04.347 --> 01:40:05.713
Clara, hold on!

1657
01:40:05.755 --> 01:40:07.351
I can't. Oh!

1658
01:40:14.987 --> 01:40:16.395
Oh!

1659
01:40:16.973 --> 01:40:19.910
Doc, I'm gonna slip you the Hoverboard!

1660
01:40:26.658 --> 01:40:29.006
Marty, watch out!

1661
01:40:36.607 --> 01:40:38.834
Emmett, help!

1662
01:40:40.857 --> 01:40:42.920
Hold on, Clara!

1663
01:40:45.864 --> 01:40:47.705
Doc, ready, Doc?

1664
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:50.314
Catch it!

1665
01:40:51.294 --> 01:40:53.064
Yes! Yes!

1666
01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:06.292
- Emmett, my hand!
- Hold on!

1667
01:41:09.768 --> 01:41:11.183
Yes!

1668
01:43:50.929 --> 01:43:52.329
Well, Doc,

1669
01:43:54.053 --> 01:43:55.804
it's destroyed.

1670
01:43:57.984 --> 01:43:59.767
Just like you wanted.

1671
01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:21.129
- Hey, butthead, get away--
- Watch it, Biff!

1672
01:44:21.154 --> 01:44:22.994
Marty, I, I didn't mean to scare you.

1673
01:44:23.019 --> 01:44:24.580
I didn't recognize you in those clothes.

1674
01:44:24.605 --> 01:44:25.627
What the hell are you doing?

1675
01:44:25.652 --> 01:44:28.511
Um, just putting on
the second coat now.

1676
01:44:29.761 --> 01:44:31.199
You going cowboy, huh?

1677
01:44:31.229 --> 01:44:32.363
Come on, guys!

1678
01:44:32.426 --> 01:44:34.527
We're gonna be late for brunch.

1679
01:44:34.644 --> 01:44:36.049
- Coming, Dave.
- Come on, Dad!

1680
01:44:36.074 --> 01:44:37.854
We're not gonna hold
your reservations all day.

1681
01:44:37.879 --> 01:44:39.486
I can't find my other glasses.

1682
01:44:39.511 --> 01:44:41.152
Lorraine, have you seen my glasses?

1683
01:44:41.183 --> 01:44:43.097
They're in your suede jacket, honey.

1684
01:44:43.145 --> 01:44:45.771
Marty, what's wrong?
We thought you went to the lake.

1685
01:44:45.796 --> 01:44:47.213
You wore that to the lake?

1686
01:44:47.243 --> 01:44:49.049
Thank God! You guys
are all back to normal.

1687
01:44:49.074 --> 01:44:50.519
Marty, who are you supposed to be?

1688
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:52.263
Clint Eastwood?

1689
01:44:52.318 --> 01:44:53.488
Right.

1690
01:44:53.551 --> 01:44:55.363
I gotta go get Jennifer.

1691
01:44:59.191 --> 01:45:01.042
I really like that hat, Marty.

1692
01:45:01.107 --> 01:45:02.591
Thanks, Biff.

1693
01:45:16.739 --> 01:45:18.216
Jennifer.

1694
01:45:20.248 --> 01:45:21.530
Jen.

1695
01:45:25.713 --> 01:45:27.014
Jennifer.

1696
01:45:50.264 --> 01:45:51.754
Marty.

1697
01:45:52.739 --> 01:45:54.434
Marty!

1698
01:45:55.637 --> 01:45:57.754
I had the worst nightmare.

1699
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:07.112
Marty, that dream I had is so real.

1700
01:46:07.565 --> 01:46:09.737
It was about the future.

1701
01:46:10.164 --> 01:46:11.752
About us.

1702
01:46:11.993 --> 01:46:13.901
And you got fired.

1703
01:46:14.432 --> 01:46:16.885
Wait a minute.
What do you mean I got fired?

1704
01:46:17.899 --> 01:46:19.384
Hilldale.

1705
01:46:20.211 --> 01:46:22.994
Hilldale!
This is where we live.

1706
01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:27.103
Um, I mean, this, this is where,
this is where we're gonna live.

1707
01:46:28.439 --> 01:46:30.111
Someday.

1708
01:46:32.453 --> 01:46:35.988
Marty, it was a dream, wasn't it?

1709
01:46:39.648 --> 01:46:40.800
Hey!

1710
01:46:40.907 --> 01:46:43.206
The big M.

1711
01:46:43.449 --> 01:46:45.581
How's it hanging, McFly?

1712
01:46:45.652 --> 01:46:46.785
Hey, Needles.

1713
01:46:46.821 --> 01:46:48.988
Nice set of wheels.

1714
01:46:49.184 --> 01:46:50.831
Let's see what she can do.

1715
01:46:50.856 --> 01:46:52.160
Next green light.

1716
01:46:52.185 --> 01:46:53.699
No, thanks.

1717
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:56.003
What's the matter?

1718
01:46:56.184 --> 01:46:57.402
Chicken?

1719
01:46:57.456 --> 01:46:58.996
Chicken McFly.

1720
01:46:59.148 --> 01:47:00.246
Woo!

1721
01:47:00.271 --> 01:47:01.630
Yeah!

1722
01:47:01.684 --> 01:47:02.941
Marty, don't.

1723
01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:04.660
Grab hold of something.

1724
01:47:05.276 --> 01:47:06.597
Come on!

1725
01:47:06.637 --> 01:47:07.887
Get on!

1726
01:47:08.982 --> 01:47:11.769
Yeah, go!
Go, go, go!

1727
01:47:33.576 --> 01:47:35.036
Did you do that on purpose?

1728
01:47:35.082 --> 01:47:37.833
Yeah, you think I'm stupid
enough to race that asshole?

1729
01:47:43.629 --> 01:47:45.004
Jesus!

1730
01:47:45.129 --> 01:47:47.489
I would have hit that Rolls-Royce.

1731
01:47:56.346 --> 01:47:57.987
It erased.

1732
01:48:12.181 --> 01:48:14.290
You're right.
There's not much left.

1733
01:48:16.587 --> 01:48:18.721
Doc's never coming back.

1734
01:48:33.211 --> 01:48:35.032
I'm sure gonna miss him, Jen.

1735
01:48:47.462 --> 01:48:49.009
What the hell?

1736
01:49:06.271 --> 01:49:07.433
Doc!

1737
01:49:07.553 --> 01:49:08.949
Marty!

1738
01:49:09.089 --> 01:49:10.347
Doc!

1739
01:49:10.439 --> 01:49:13.879
- Doc!
- Marty, it runs on steam!

1740
01:49:19.226 --> 01:49:21.035
Meet the family.

1741
01:49:21.427 --> 01:49:22.661
Clara, you know.

1742
01:49:22.691 --> 01:49:24.114
Hi, Marty.

1743
01:49:24.254 --> 01:49:25.614
Ma'am!

1744
01:49:26.214 --> 01:49:28.160
These are our boys.

1745
01:49:29.115 --> 01:49:30.590
Jules.

1746
01:49:31.841 --> 01:49:33.426
And Verne.

1747
01:49:35.976 --> 01:49:37.150
Boys,

1748
01:49:37.182 --> 01:49:39.322
this is Marty and Jennifer.

1749
01:49:41.830 --> 01:49:43.986
Doc, I thought
I'd never see you again.

1750
01:49:44.072 --> 01:49:46.228
You can't keep a good scientist down.

1751
01:49:46.253 --> 01:49:48.416
After all, I had to
come back for Einstein,

1752
01:49:48.443 --> 01:49:51.432
and well, I didn't want you
to be worried about me.

1753
01:49:52.275 --> 01:49:53.557
Oh!

1754
01:49:53.782 --> 01:49:56.242
I brought you a little souvenir.

1755
01:50:12.896 --> 01:50:14.791
It's great, Doc.

1756
01:50:15.377 --> 01:50:16.916
Thanks.

1757
01:50:18.449 --> 01:50:20.182
Dr. Brown.

1758
01:50:20.331 --> 01:50:23.135
I brought this note
back from the future and...

1759
01:50:23.408 --> 01:50:24.901
now it's erased.

1760
01:50:25.018 --> 01:50:27.182
Of course, it's erased.

1761
01:50:28.656 --> 01:50:30.185
But, what does that mean?

1762
01:50:30.263 --> 01:50:33.771
It means, your future
hasn't been written yet.

1763
01:50:33.915 --> 01:50:35.599
No one's has.

1764
01:50:35.739 --> 01:50:38.248
Your future is whatever you make it.

1765
01:50:38.337 --> 01:50:39.919
So, make it a good one.

1766
01:50:39.967 --> 01:50:41.342
Both of you.

1767
01:50:43.952 --> 01:50:45.310
We will, Doc.

1768
01:50:45.377 --> 01:50:46.935
Stand back.

1769
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:49.576
All right, boys, buckle up.

1770
01:50:54.393 --> 01:50:55.777
Hey, Doc.

1771
01:50:56.005 --> 01:50:57.973
Where are you going now?

1772
01:50:58.036 --> 01:50:59.895
